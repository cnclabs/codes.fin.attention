industry background over time  the semiconductor industry continues to improve the overall capabilities of integrated circuits  or chips  including faster processing speeds  power efficiency and the ability to integrate multiple functions into a single integrated circuit that  in the past  would have required multiple discrete integrated circuits 
these advances in semiconductor technology along with the wide adoption of industry standard interconnectivity protocols such as ethernet and wireless local area networking wlan are enabling a large and diverse number of electronic devices to now be interconnected and capable of transmitting voice  video  audio and data through both wired and wireless connections 
with this capability to transmit and process information at high speeds a growing number of business enterprise and consumer electronic devices are now sharing and communicating information for many different applications 
also  with the capability to communicate with other devices combined with the increased processing speeds of the integrated circuits  these devices are supporting a larger number of applications and features 
the devices ability to download larger amounts of data is  in turn  increasing the devices data storage requirements 
given the increased bandwidth and the growing number of devices communicating with one another  the communication infrastructure that supports the interconnection of all of these devices continues to grow in size and sophistication 
most of these devices interconnect and transmit information to other devices using analog signals but process the information within the device using digital signals 
as a result  these devices require a combination of both analog and digital integrated circuit technologies 
given the high volume and cost sensitive nature of these consumer and business enterprise applications  it is very beneficial to integrate many of the analog and digital functions onto a single integrated circuit which helps lower system cost and power consumption 
these highly integrated mixed signal chips are typically manufactured using complementary metal oxide semiconductor or cmos based technology that allows for low cost complex functional integration 
also  to further maximize the performance of these advanced mixed signal integrated circuits very advanced digital signal processing algorithms are utilized as well 
because the processing requirements of these mixed signal integrated circuits continue to expand with the increased performance and sophistication of the devices in which they are embedded  many of these integrated circuits are now also integrating high performance embedded microprocessors to handle this increased workload 
this minimizes or eliminates the need for a costly host central processing unit  or cpu 
with improvements in the performance of such embedded microprocessors  devices can further expand their capabilities while at the same time minimizing power requirements 
many of these new  sophisticated devices are also handheld battery powered devices in which minimizing the power consumption is critical to maximize the life of the battery 
utilizing highly integrated chips as well as chips designed to optimize power efficiency is very important for these handheld devices 
additionally  advanced digital power management solutions that regulate the power supplied to the integrated circuits in an efficient and cost effective manner are becoming more and more important to help reduce overall power consumption as well as the total size of the power management solution 
given the increased sophistication of these devices  the high level of semiconductor integration  and the constant time to market pressures of the system manufacturers  it is becoming very important for a semiconductor manufacturer develop a complete system level understanding of a device in order to provide optimal integration  software support and system reference designs to assist in timely product development

this allows us to focus our efforts on the design and marketing of our products 
we currently outsource a substantial percentage of our integrated circuit manufacturing to taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  with the remaining manufacturing outsourced to other foundries primarily in asia 
we work closely with tsmc and our other foundries to forecast on a monthly basis our manufacturing capacity requirements 
our integrated circuits are currently fabricated in several advanced  sub micron manufacturing processes 
because finer manufacturing processes lead to enhanced performance  smaller silicon chip size and lower power requirements  we continually evaluate the benefits and feasibility of migrating to smaller geometry process technology in order to reduce cost and improve performance 
in november we acquired the communications and application processor business from intel corporation 
as part of this acquisition we entered into a product supply agreement with intel 
under the terms of the supply agreement  intel will continue to fabricate and supply integrated circuits to us while we arrange for our independent foundries to begin to supply us with such products 
we have committed to purchase and intel has agreed to supply through june a minimum number of wafers at fixed prices 
if at the end of any fiscal quarter for intel  there is a shortfall between the quantity of supply ordered by us and the quantities of supply required under the supply agreement commitment  intel can invoice us for the shortfall and will deliver the corresponding quantity upon receipt of payment from us 
the supply agreement requires us to prepay for certain wafers six months in advance of delivery and requires us to issue non cancellable purchase orders at least six months in advance of requested delivery dates for all purchases under the supply agreement 
assembly and test most of our products are shipped from our third party foundries to third party sort  assembly and test facilities where they are assembled into finished integrated circuit packages and tested 
we outsource all product packaging and substantially all testing requirements for these products to several assembly and test subcontractors  including stats chippac ltd 
and global testing corporation in singapore  siliconware precision industries in taiwan and ase electronics in singapore  taiwan and malaysia 
we also perform some in house testing in malaysia primarily for our printer asic solutions and in the united states of new production and pre production materials prior to transferring the volume packaging and testing offshore to our third party assembly and test subcontractors 
the remainder of our products are manufactured on a turnkey basis  in which we purchase fully assembled and tested products from our foundries 
our products are designed to use low cost  standard packages and to be tested with widely available test equipment 
in addition  we specifically design our integrated circuits for ease of testability  further reducing production costs 
quality assurance we build quality into our products starting with the design and development process 
our designs are subjected to extensive circuit simulation under extreme conditions of temperature  voltage and processing before being committed to manufacture 
we pre qualify each of our subcontractors and conduct regular in depth quality audits 
we closely monitor foundry production to ensure consistent overall quality  reliability and yield levels 
all of our independent foundries and assembly and test subcontractors have been awarded iso certification 
intellectual property our future revenue growth and overall success depend in large part on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  contractual provisions and licenses to protect our intellectual property 
we also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  suppliers and customers and seek to control access to  and distribution of  our documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products and technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
in addition  we often incorporate the intellectual property of other companies into our designs  and we have certain obligations with respect to the non use and non disclosure of their intellectual property 
it is possible  however  that the steps taken by us to prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or our customers intellectual property may not be successful 
as of january   we have been issued or have acquired united states patents and non united states patents on various aspects of our technology  with expiration dates ranging from to we have filed a number of additional patent applications in the united states and other countries 
however  there can be no assurance that patents will ever be issued for these applications 
furthermore  it is possible that our patents may be invalidated  circumvented  challenged or licensed to others 
additionally  the laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or proprietary information to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in these countries 
we may need to engage in litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or the rights of our customers  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
this litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have expended and will continue to expend considerable resources in establishing a patent position designed to protect our intellectual property 
while our ability to compete is enhanced by our ability to protect our intellectual property  we believe that in view of the rapid pace of technological change  the combination of the technical experience and innovative skills of our employees may be as important to our business as the legal protection of our patents and other proprietary information 
from time to time  we may desire or be required to renew or to obtain licenses from third parties in order to further develop and effectively market commercially viable products 
we cannot be sure that any necessary licenses will be available or will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
the integrated circuit industry is characterized by vigorous pursuit and protection of intellectual property rights  which has resulted in significant and often time consuming and expensive litigation 
from time to time  we receive  and may continue to receive in the future  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused the proprietary rights of other parties 
although we defend these claims vigorously  it is possible that we will not prevail in pending or future lawsuits 
in addition  we may be sued in the future by other parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets  or who may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents 
any of these claims could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even if claims against us are not valid or successfully asserted  these claims could result in significant costs and a diversion of management and personnel resources to defend 
in that event  our business  financial condition and results of operations could also be materially and adversely affected 
in any of the pending or future claims or actions asserted against us  we may seek to obtain licenses under a third party s intellectual property rights 
however  we may not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
competition the markets for our products are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change  evolving standards  short product life cycles and pricing pressures imposed by high volume customers 
we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings and new competitors enter our markets 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving markets for our products depends on a number of factors  including performance  features  quality and price of our products  the timing and success of new product introductions by us  our customers and our competitors  the emergence of new industry standards  our ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity  the number and nature of our competitors in a given market  and general market and economic conditions 
our current products face competition from a number of sources 
we believe that our principal competitors for our read channels and storage socs are lsi corporation and stmicroelectronics 
our primary competitors for preamplifiers and motor controllers are lsi corporation and texas instruments 
for transceiver products  we compete primarily with lsi corporation  broadcom  intel  realtek semiconductor and vitesse semiconductor 
our switching products compete primarily against broadcom and vitesse 
in the market for system controllers  our competitors include tundra and plx technology  and our wan communications controllers compete directly with products from companies such as freescale semiconductor and pmc sierra 
our cellular and handheld products compete primarily against broadcom  freescale semiconductor  qualcomm corporation  samsung semiconductor  and texas instruments 
in the wireless lan market  our competitors include atheros  broadcom  conexant  intel and texas instruments 
for our power management products we compete with a number of companies including analog devices  international rectifier  intersil corporation  linear technology  maxim integrated products incorporated  national semiconductor and texas instruments 
our hard disk controller products compete primarily against devices offered by lsi corporation and those internally developed by the hard disk manufacturers 
our tape drive controller products compete primarily against devices internally developed by tape drive manufacturers 
our voip solutions compete primarily against texas instruments and broadcom 
in addition  we expect increased competition in the future from other emerging and established companies 
some of our current competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to changing customer demands or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
our current or future competitors may develop and introduce new products that will be priced lower  provide superior performance or achieve greater market acceptance than our products 
in addition  in the event of a manufacturing capacity shortage  these competitors may be able to manufacture products when we are unable to do so 
furthermore  current or potential competitors have established or may establish financial and strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers or other third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share  which would harm our business 
in addition  many of our customers and potential customers have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources 
some customers have already developed  or in the future may develop  technologies that will compete directly with our products 
we may also face competition from suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies 
historically  average unit selling prices in the integrated circuit industry in general  and for our products in particular  have decreased over the life of a particular product 
we expect that the average unit selling prices of our products will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressures 
in order to offset expected declines in the average unit selling prices of our products  we will likely need to reduce the cost of our products 
we intend to accomplish this by implementing design changes that lower the cost of manufacturing  assembly and testing  by entering into long term  strategic arrangements with our foundry partners to secure wafer capacity at reduced prices  by negotiating reduced charges from our foundries as and if volumes increase and by successfully managing our manufacturing  assembly and testing relationships 
because we do not operate our own manufacturing  assembly or testing facilities  we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities 
if we fail to introduce lower cost versions of our products in a timely manner or to successfully manage our manufacturing  assembly and testing relationships  our business would be harmed 
employees as of january   we had a total of  employees  of which  were in research and development  in sales and marketing  in operations and in general administration 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements  and we have not experienced any work stoppage 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good

risk factors additional factors that may affect future results in addition to the factors discussed in the overview and liquidity and capital resources sections of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  the following additional factors may affect our future results 
many of these factors are beyond our control  including business cycles and seasonal trends of the computing  semiconductor and related industries 
matters related to the internal review of our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our financial statements may result in additional litigation  regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions 
our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation  regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions 
for more information regarding our current litigation and related inquiries  please see the discussion included in part i  item legal proceedings  of this report as well as the other risk factors related to litigation set forth in this section 
we have provided the results of our internal review to the securities and exchange commission the sec and the united states attorney s office for the northern district of california  and in that regard we have responded to formal and informal requests for documents and additional information 
the sec is conducting a formal inquiry into our historical stock option granting practices and we received a grand jury subpoena from the united states attorney s office for the northern district of california requesting documents relating to our historical stock option granting practices 
no assurance can be given regarding the outcomes of litigation  regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions relating to our past stock option practices 
the resolution of these matters will be time consuming and expensive  and may distract management from the conduct of our business 
further  if we are subject to adverse findings in litigation  regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions  we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed against us  our directors  executive officers or other officers  or employees  which could harm our reputation  business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  while we believe that we have  in completing the restatement of our financial statements  made appropriate judgments in determining the correct measurement dates and disclosures relating to our stock option investigation  the sec may disagree with the manner in which we reported the results of the investigation or accounted for and reported  or did not report  the corresponding financial impact 
accordingly  it is possible that we will be required to restate further our prior financial statements  amend prior filings with the sec  or take other actions not currently contemplated 
a number of our current and former executive officers and directors have been named as parties to several derivative action lawsuits arising from our internal option review  and there is a possibility of additional lawsuits  all of which could require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses 
we are subject to a number of lawsuits purportedly on behalf of us against certain of our current and former executive officers and board members  and we may become the subject of additional private lawsuits 
subject to certain limitations  we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors  officers and employees in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and such lawsuits 
the expenses associated with these lawsuits may be significant  the amount of time to resolve these lawsuits is unpredictable and defending these lawsuits may divert management s attention from the day to day operations of our business  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  business  results of operations and cash flows 
recent changes in our management may cause uncertainty in  or be disruptive to  our business 
we have recently experienced significant changes in our management and our board of directors 
in may  our former chief financial officer resigned and our executive vice president and chief operating officer  who is one of our co founders  resigned from those positions and as a member of our board of directors and will continue in a non management role 
also  the general counsel of our us operating subsidiary was terminated in march we are conducting a search for a permanent chief operating officer  chief financial officer and general counsel 
we have also commenced a search for three new independent directors to fill existing vacancies on our board of directors  one of whom will succeed dr 
sehat sutardja as chairman of the board 
we cannot assure you that we will find qualified candidates in a timely manner 
these changes in our management and board of directors may be disruptive to our business  and  during the transition period  there may be uncertainty among customers  investors  vendors  employees and others concerning our future direction and performance 
our future success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our management team to work together effectively 
the loss of any of our management or other key personnel could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate 
moreover  our success will depend on our ability to attract  hire and retain management and other key personnel and on the abilities of the new management personnel to function effectively  both individually and as a group  going forward 
if we are unable to attract and retain effective permanent replacements for our key executives in a timely manner  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected and our ability to execute our business model could be impaired 
competition for qualified senior employees can be intense 
we may experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled individuals with appropriate qualifications to support our growth and expansion 
for example  both our interim chief financial officer and interim general counsel may choose not to participate as candidates in our search to fill these positions 
if we fail to attract  hire and retain qualified management individuals  it could lead to dissatisfaction among our customers  which could slow our growth or result in a loss of business 
we have been named as a party to several purported class action and derivative lawsuits relating to our past option granting practices  and we may be named in additional litigation  all of which could cause our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows to suffer 
we have been named as a nominal defendant in purported shareholder derivative actions that name a number of our current and former directors and officers as defendants and that seek to recover damages purportedly sustained by us in connection with our option granting practices 
further  putative class actions have been filed against us and certain of our officers and directors that allege violations of the federal securities laws and seek to recover damages 
we may in the future be subject to additional litigation relating to our past option granting practices 
regardless of the outcome  this litigation  and any other litigation that may be brought against us or our directors and officers  could be time consuming  result in significant expense  and divert the attention and resources of our management and other key employees 
an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the matters relating to the internal review of our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our financial statements may otherwise adversely impact our business 
as a result of our delayed filing of our quarterly reports on form q for the fiscal quarters ended july   october   and april  and our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended january   we will be ineligible to register our securities on form s for sale by us or resale by others 
we may use form s to raise capital or complete acquisitions  but doing so could increase transaction costs and adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner 
employees who were awarded options that were granted at a discount from fair market value and were all or partially unvested as of december   which we refer to as discount options  may be subject to income tax liability on the vesting date of those discount options in addition to a excise tax under internal revenue code irc section a 
california has adopted irc a and therefore a excise tax will be levied on all california employees 
in considering actions that we believe would be in the best interests of our shareholders and employees and might substantially reduce or eliminate section a exposure and adverse state tax liability for our employees  we have elected to comply with the franchise tax board notice program in california 
the program allows us to pay the additional tax and interest due to the exercise of certain discounted stock options in pursuant to revenue and taxation code there is no guarantee that this measure to address employees adverse tax consequences will be effective or successful 
any such measures may cause us to incur additional cash or noncash compensation expense 
in addition  these measures  or the failure of these measures  may require us to incur substantial expenses for legal  accounting  tax and other professional services  could cause employee satisfaction and retention issues  and may divert our management s attention from our business  which could in the future harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have had material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future 
if our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective  there may be errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement or our filings may not be timely and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could lead to a decline in our stock price 
we have determined that we have had material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud 
any inability to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud could harm our business 
the sarbanes oxley act of requires management and our auditors to evaluate and assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
in assessing the findings of our internal review with respect to our historical stock option practices and related accounting matters  our management concluded that there were material weaknesses  as defined in public company accounting oversight board auditing standard no 
 in our internal control over financial reporting 
see the discussion included in part ii  item a controls and procedures  of this report for additional information regarding our internal control over financial reporting  including planned remediation 
our management  including our chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer  does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  involving us have been  or will be  detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake  and errors discovered by personnel within control systems may not be properly disclosed and addressed 
controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the controls 
the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
we cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future 
we may not be able to effectively and timely implement necessary control changes and employee training to ensure continued compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and other regulatory and reporting requirements 
our rapid growth and numerous acquisitions in recent periods  and our possible future expansion through additional acquisitions  present challenges to maintain the internal control and disclosure control standards applicable to public companies 
any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls  or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation  could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses  cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations  or result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding disclosure controls and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under the sarbanes oxley act 
the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements  cause us to fail to timely meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  leading to a decline in our stock price 
if we fail to maintain effective internal controls we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and sanctions and investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act or that management or our auditors will conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in future periods 
we have not been in compliance with sec periodic reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements and may continue to face compliance issues with both  which could result in the delisting of our common shares from the nasdaq stock market 
as a result of our failure to timely file our quarterly reports on form q for the fiscal quarters ended july  and october  the fiscal qs  this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended january  the k and the quarterly report on form q for the fiscal quarter ended april  q fiscal q together with the fiscal qs  the delayed forms q  we have not been in full compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule c which requires us to make  on a timely basis  all filings with the sec required by the securities exchange act of with the filing of this k and the fiscal qs  which have been filed concurrently  we still must file our q fiscal q to regain compliance with marketplace rule c 
we expect to file our q fiscal q as soon as practicable 
if the sec disagrees with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported  or not reported  the financial impact of past stock option grants  there could be further delays in filing subsequent sec reports or other actions that might result in delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq global select market 
if we are unable to maintain compliance with the conditions for continued listing required by nasdaq  then our shares of common stock may be subject to delisting from the nasdaq global select market 
if our shares of common stock are delisted from the nasdaq global select market  they may not be eligible to trade on any national securities exchange or the over the counter market 
if our common stock is no longer traded through a market system  the liquidity of our common stock may be greatly reduced  which could negatively affect its price 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain future equity financing  or use our common stock as consideration for mergers or other business combinations 
a delisting from the nasdaq global select market may also have other negative implications  including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers  customers and employees  the loss of institutional investor interest  and fewer business development opportunities 
we are obligated to purchase and pre pay for specified volumes of wafers from intel corporation which will adversely affect our cash flow and could lead to inventory write downs and related charges to our earnings  but intel is not obligated to increase supply if we encounter unexpected demand 
in connection with our acquisition of intel s communications and application processor business  we entered into a supply agreement with intel in an effort to secure supplies of the products and wafers that we will need to sell the acquired product lines 
under the terms of the supply agreement we have committed to purchase and intel has agreed to supply  through june  a minimum number of wafers at fixed prices 
if at the end of any intel fiscal quarter  there is a shortfall between the quantity of supply ordered by us and the quantities of supply required under the supply agreement commitment  intel can invoice us for the shortfall and will deliver the corresponding quantity upon receipt of payment from us 
the agreement requires us to prepay for certain wafers six months in advance of delivery and issue non cancellable purchase orders at least six months in advance of requested delivery dates for all purchases under the supply agreement 
the supply agreement contractually commits us to purchase supply from intel regardless of future end customer demand for these products 
the amount of wafers we committed to purchase was largely based on our forecasted demand over an extended period of time 
forecasting demand over such a period of time is difficult and is subject to many risks 
if the level of demand does not materialize to consume the product we are obligated to purchase from intel  we may record additional charges for excess inventory purchases and commitments which could be material 
the supply agreement also requires us to purchase inventory earlier than anticipated product shipments to our customers 
as a result  we expect our inventory balances for these products to increase  resulting in higher inventory balances and the associated carrying costs 
additionally  these higher levels of inventory increase our risk of holding excess and obsolete inventory 
this could harm our business  results of operations and cash flows by leading to inventory write downs and related charges to our earnings 
the supply agreement also limits the amount of product that intel is required to supply to us 
if we experience an increase in demand  we might not be able to secure enough supply from intel to meet that demand 
this would lead to lost sales in the short term as well as the long term due to possible customer dissatisfaction 
if we are unable to successfully transition and secure production capacity for our communications and application processor business  we could lose a significant portion of that business 
our supply agreement with intel was entered into to secure a supply of wafers and products during a transition period while we arranged for our independent foundries and other contractors to begin fabrication  assembly and test for these products 
intel is only obligated to supply specified quantities of product for a limited amount of time  no later than june some of these products are at earlier stages in their new product introduction processes  where manufacturing yields are not yet consistent and changes to the design and processes may still have to be made 
this can make the transition of the manufacture of these products to independent foundries and other contractors more complicated and expensive 
if we do not successfully transition the production of the wafers and products to independent foundries and other contractors  we will be unable to meet customer demand for these products 
this could result in a material decline in revenues  net income  and cash flow 
additionally  our customers could become dissatisfied with us and not continue to use our products if and when we were able to resume providing them with products or if the newly transitioned products would require extended customer re qualification 
our recent acquisitions and any future acquisitions could harm our operating results and share price 
in  we acquired the hard disk and tape drive controller semiconductor business of qlogic corporation and the semiconductor design business division of utstarcom  inc in may  we acquired the printer semiconductor division of avago technologies  pte 
as well as certain intellectual property and property and equipment from another company 
in november  we purchased the communications and application processor business from intel corporation 
any of these acquisitions  as well as acquisitions in the future  could materially harm our operating results or liquidity as a result of possible concurrent issuances of dilutive equity securities or payment of cash 
in addition  the purchase price of any acquired businesses may exceed the current fair values of the net tangible assets of the acquired businesses 
as a result  we would be required to record material amounts of goodwill  and acquired in process research and development charges and other intangible assets  which could result in significant impairment and acquired in process research and development charges and amortization expense in future periods 
these charges  in addition to the results of operations of such acquired businesses  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if we acquire a business that is operating at a loss or at lower overall gross margins than our businesses  as is the case with the communications and application processor business we acquired from intel  our profitability will be harmed unless we can improve its performance 
we cannot forecast the number  timing or size of future acquisitions  or the effect that any such acquisitions might have on our operating or financial results 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to review our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we are required to review our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis 
if presently unforeseen events or changes in circumstances arise which indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable  we will be required to perform impairment reviews of these assets  which have carrying values of approximately billion as of january  an impairment review could result in a write down of all or a portion of these assets to their fair values 
we intend to perform an annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
in light of the large carrying value associated with our goodwill and intangible assets  any write down of these assets may result in a significant charge to our statement of operations in the period any impairment is determined and could cause our stock price to decline 
past acquisitions and any future acquisitions or transactions may not be successful 
we expect to continue to make acquisitions of  and investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services and technologies  augment our market segment coverage  or enhance our technological capabilities 
we may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition  investment  alliance  or joint venture opportunities or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions or relationships on terms and conditions acceptable to us  or that such transactions or relationships will be successful 
any transactions or relationships will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered with those matters 
risks that could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations or financial condition include  among other things the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired businesses  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the distraction of management from our business  the potential inability of management to maximize our financial and strategic position as a result of an acquisition  the potential for costs and delays in implementing  and the potential difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  including the integration of different information systems  the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel  the risk of entering market segments in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such market segments have stronger market segment positions  the risk that there could be deficiencies in the internal control of any acquired company or investments that could result in a material weakness in our overall internal controls taken as a whole  the potential loss of key employees of an acquired company  and the potential dilution of earnings through acquisitions and options granted to employees of acquired companies or businesses 
our ability to realize the expected benefits of our acquisition of the communications and application processor business of intel corporation and to eliminate the operating losses of that business will depend in large part on our ability to transition the manufacturing of that business products from intel to third party foundries  increase the gross margin of those products  and retain the business relationship with its principal customers  as well as the factors described above relating to our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business and its technologies  operations and personnel 
a significant portion of our business is dependent on the hard disk drive industry  which is highly cyclical  experiences rapid technological change  and is facing increased competition from alternate technologies 
the hard disk drive industry is intensely competitive  and the technology changes rapidly 
as a result  this industry is highly cyclical  with periods of increased demand and rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and subsequent contraction 
these cycles may affect us because our customers are suppliers to this industry 
hard disk drive manufacturers tend to order more components than they may need during growth periods  and sharply reduce orders for components during periods of contraction 
in addition  advances in existing technologies and the introduction of new technologies may result in lower demand for disk drive storage devices  thereby reducing demand for our products 
rapid technological changes in the hard disk drive industry often result in significant and rapid shifts in market share among the industry s participants 
if the hard disk drive manufacturers using our products do not retain or increase their market share  our sales may decrease 
future changes in the nature of information storage products may reduce demand for traditional hard disk drives 
for instance  products using alternative technologies  such as semiconductor memory  optical storage  and other storage technologies could become a significant source of competition to manufacturers of hard disk drives 
flash memory has typically been more costly than disk drive technologies 
however  flash memory manufacturers have been reducing the prices for their products  which could enable them to complete more effectively with very small form factor hard disk drive products 
demand for hard disk drives could be reduced if alternative storage technologies such as flash memory can meet customers cost and capacity requirements 
we depend on a small number of large customers for a significant portion of our sales 
the loss of  or a significant reduction or cancellation in sales to  any key customer would significantly reduce our revenues 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was derived from sales to three customers  each of which individually accounted for or more of our net revenue during this period 
of these customers  western digital accounted for approximately  toshiba accounted for approximately and samsung accounted for approximately 
no distributor accounted for of our net revenue during fiscal sales to our largest customers have fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer  as well as the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets  and will likely continue to fluctuate dramatically in the future 
the loss of any of our largest customers  a significant reduction in sales we make to them  or any problems we encounter collecting amounts due from them would likely seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers  as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our products 
in the future  these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all  purchase fewer products than they did in the past  or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way  particularly because substantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis  which permits our customers to cancel  change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty  our customers may develop their own solutions  our customers may purchase integrated circuits from our competitors  or our customers may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products 
if we are unable to accurately predict our future sales and to appropriately budget for our expenses  our operating results could suffer 
the rapidly changing nature of the markets in which we sell our products limits our ability to accurately forecast quarterly and annual sales 
additionally  because many of our expenses are fixed in the short term or are incurred in advance of anticipated sales  we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any shortfall of sales 
we are currently expanding our staffing and increasing our expense levels in anticipation of future sales growth 
if our sales do not increase as anticipated  significant losses could result due to our higher expense levels 
because we expect to experience continued lower sequential growth rates in future periods  investors should not rely on our historical growth rates when evaluating our business 
from fiscal year to fiscal year  we reported significant sequential quarterly growth in revenues  however  our revenues have been inconsistent and have generally grown at a slower sequential rate in the ten quarters ending with the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the double digit sequential growth rate of the previous eleven quarters 
this slower growth rate is due  among other things  to the larger base of revenue and market share we now enjoy  which makes continuation of double digit revenue growth on a sequential quarterly basis unlikely in the current market 
accordingly  investors should not rely on the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future performance 
changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may cause adverse unexpected revenue and expense fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices by regulators may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
for example  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued its final standard on accounting for share based payments  fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment fas r  which required us  starting january   to measure compensation costs for all stock based compensation including stock options at fair value and to recognize these costs as expenses in our statements of operations 
the recognition of these expenses in our statements of operations will reduce our earnings per share  which could negatively impact our future stock price 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost effective manner  our operating results and competitive position will be harmed 
our future success will depend on our ability  in a timely and cost effective manner  to develop and introduce new products and enhancements to our existing products 
we must also achieve market acceptance for these products and enhancements 
if we do not successfully develop and achieve market acceptance for new and enhanced products  our ability to maintain or increase revenues will suffer 
the development of our products is highly complex 
we occasionally have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements  and we could experience delays in the future 
even if new and enhanced products are introduced to the market  we may not be able to achieve market acceptance of them in a timely manner 
in addition  our longstanding relationships with some of our larger customers may also deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products 
to attract new customers or retain existing customers  we may offer certain customers favorable prices on our products 
if these prices are lower than the prices paid by our existing customers  we would have to offer the same lower prices to certain of our customers who have contractual most favored nation pricing arrangements 
in that event  our average selling prices and gross margins would decline 
the loss of a key customer  a reduction in sales to any key customer or our inability to attract new significant customers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to appropriately scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products and services or to the demand for new products requested by our customers  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
to achieve our business objectives  we anticipate that we will need to continue to expand 
we have experienced rapid growth and expansion in the past 
through internal growth and acquisitions  we significantly increased the scope of our operations and expanded our workforce from  employees  as of january   to  employees  as of january  nonetheless  we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products and services or to the demand for new products requested by our customers 
in that event  we may be unable to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities  and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 
conversely  if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly in anticipation of increased demand for our products  and such demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expected  the rate of increase in our operating expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue  which would adversely affect our operating results 
our past growth has placed  and any future growth is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our management personnel  systems and resources 
to implement our current business and product plans  we will need to continue to expand  train  manage and motivate our workforce 
all of these endeavors will require substantial management effort 
although we have implemented an enterprise resource planning system to help us improve our planning and management processes and are implementing a new human resources management system  we anticipate that we will also need to continue to implement and improve a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems  as well as additional procedures and other internal management systems 
these processes can be time consuming and expensive  increase management responsibilities  and divert management attention 
if we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations  we may be unable to scale our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities  or conversely  we may scale our business too quickly and the rate of increase in our expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue  either of which would materially and adversely affect our current or future business 
we rely on independent foundries and subcontractors for the manufacture  assembly and testing of our integrated circuit products  and the failure of any of these third party vendors to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers  decrease our sales and limit our growth 
we do not have our own manufacturing or assembly facilities and have very limited in house testing facilities 
therefore  we rely on third party vendors to manufacture  assemble and test the products we design 
we currently rely on several third party foundries to produce substantially all of our integrated circuit products 
we also currently rely on several third party assembly and test subcontractors to assemble  package and test our products 
the resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome  the outbreak of avian flu and any similar future outbreaks in asia  where these foundries are located  could affect the production capabilities of our manufacturers by resulting in quarantines or closures 
in the event of such a quarantine or closure  if we were unable to quickly identify alternate manufacturing facilities  our revenues  cost of revenues and results of operations would be negatively impacted 
if these vendors do not provide us with high quality products and services in a timely manner  or if one or more of these vendors terminates its relationship with us  we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacements to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis  our relationships with our customers could suffer  our sales could decrease and harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
with limited exceptions  our vendors are not obligated to perform services or supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantities  or at any specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
these vendors may allocate capacity to the production of other companies products while reducing deliveries to us on short notice 
in particular  some foundry customers may have long term agreements with these foundries that may cause these foundries to reallocate capacity to those customers  decreasing the capacity available to us 
if we need another integrated circuit foundry or assembly and test subcontractor because of increased demand  or we are unable to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from our providers at the required time  we might not be able to develop relationships with other vendors who are able to satisfy our requirements 
even if other integrated circuit foundries or assembly and test subcontractors are available at that time to satisfy our requirements  it would likely take several months to qualify a new provider 
such a change may also require the approval of our customers  which would take time to effect and could cause our customers to cancel orders or fail to place new orders 
a number of our subsidiaries are incorporated under the laws of  and their principal offices are located in  the state of israel and  therefore  their business operations may be harmed by adverse political  economic and military conditions affecting israel 
each of marvell semiconductor israel ltd 
msil  marvell ti ltd 
mtil  marvell software solutions israel ltd 
mssi and marvell dspc ltd 
dspc is incorporated under the laws of and has its principal offices in israel 
in addition  msil  mssi and dspc maintain their research and development operations in israel 
thus  msil  mtil  mssi and dspc are directly influenced by the political  economic and military conditions affecting israel 
major hostilities involving or within israel could disrupt msil  mtil  mssi and dspc s operations 
for example  continued hostilities between israel and the palestinian authority in recent months have caused substantial political unrest  which could lead to a potential economic downturn in israel 
additionally  the ongoing situation in iraq could lead to more economic instability and uncertainty in the state of israel and the middle east 
also  the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel could negatively impact the business operations and financial results of each of msil  mtil  mssi and dspc 
we rely on third party distributors and manufacturers representatives and the failure of these distributors and manufacturers representatives to perform as expected could reduce our future sales 
we sell many of our products to customers through distributors and manufacturers representatives 
our relationships with some of our distributors and manufacturers representatives have been established within the last two years  and we are unable to predict the extent to which our distributors and manufacturers representatives will be successful in marketing and selling our products 
moreover  many of our manufacturers representatives and distributors also market and sell competing products 
our representatives and distributors may terminate their relationships with us at any time 
our future performance will also depend  in part  on our ability to attract additional distributors or manufacturers representatives that will be able to market and support our products effectively  especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products 
if we cannot retain our current distributors or manufacturers representatives or recruit additional or replacement distributors or manufacturers representatives  our sales and operating results will be harmed 
the loss of one or more of our distributors or manufacturers representatives could harm our sales and results of operations 
we generally realize a higher gross margin on direct sales and from sales through manufacturers representatives than on sales through distributors 
accordingly  if our distributors were to account for an increased portion of our net sales  our gross margins may decline 
we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties  and if we are unable to accurately predict customer demand  we may hold excess or obsolete inventory  which would reduce our profit margin  or  conversely  we may have insufficient inventory  which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potentially in loss of market share and damaged customer relationships 
we typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments 
customers can generally cancel or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a significant penalty 
in the recent past  some of our customers have developed excess inventories of their own products and have  as a consequence  deferred purchase orders for our products 
we cannot accurately predict what or how many products our customers will need in the future 
anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face volatile pricing and unpredictable demand for their own products and are increasingly focused more on cash preservation and tighter inventory management 
in addition  as an increasing number of our chips are being incorporated into consumer products  we anticipate greater fluctuations in demand for our products  which makes it more difficult to forecast customer demand 
we place orders with our suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand and  in some instances  may establish buffer inventories to accommodate anticipated demand 
our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions  each of which may introduce error into our estimates 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell when we expect to  if at all 
as a result  we would hold excess or obsolete inventory  which would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our financial results 
conversely  if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available  we would forgo revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
in addition  any future significant cancellations or deferrals of product orders or the return of previously sold products could materially and adversely affect our profit margins  increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
furthermore  we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to a customer 
if a customer refuses to accept shipped products or does not timely pay for these products  we could incur significant charges against our income 
the international nature of our business exposes us to financial and regulatory risks that may adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
international operations are subject to a number of risks that may limit our ability to design  develop  test or market certain technologies and products  which could in turn have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  including international terrorism and anti american sentiment  particularly in the emerging markets  security concerns  including crime  political instability  armed conflict and civil or military unrest  local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices in the united states  regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions  laws and business practices favoring local companies  differing employment practices and labor issues  withholding tax obligations on revenues that we may not be able to offset fully against our us tax obligations  including the further risk that foreign tax authorities may increase tax rates  which could result in increased tax withholdings and penalties  less effective protection of intellectual property than is afforded to us in the united states or other developed countries  and limited infrastructure and disruptions  such as large scale outages or interruptions of service from utilities or telecommunications providers and natural disasters 
these conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers  our vendors and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
we cannot predict the timing  strength or duration of any economic recovery  worldwide  or in our served markets 
if the worldwide economy or our served markets in which we operate were to experience any of the conditions above  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we are a mid sized company with limited resources compared to some of our current and potential competitors  and we may not be able to compete effectively and increase or maintain revenue and market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors 
if we do not compete successfully  our market share and revenues may not increase or may decline 
in addition  some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater resources and name recognition  and a larger base of customers than we do 
as a result  these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers 
moreover  our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do 
they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we do  which would allow them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
in addition  new competitors or alliances among existing competitors could emerge 
we expect to face competition in the future from our current competitors  other manufacturers and designers of integrated circuits  and innovative start up integrated circuit design companies 
many of our customers are also large  established integrated circuit suppliers 
our sales to and support of such customers may enable them to become a source of competition to us  despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights 
our future success depends in significant part on strategic relationships with customers 
if we cannot maintain these relationships or if these customers develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solutions instead of buying our products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
in the past  we have relied in significant part on our strategic relationships with customers that are technology leaders in our target markets 
we intend to pursue and continue to form these strategic relationships in the future but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
these relationships often require us to develop new products that may involve significant technological challenges 
our customers frequently place considerable pressure on us to meet their tight development schedules 
accordingly  we may have to devote a substantial amount of our limited resources to our strategic relationships  which could detract from or delay our completion of other important development projects 
delays in the development could impair our relationships with our strategic customers and negatively impact sales of the products under development 
moreover  it is possible that our customers may develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solution for products that they currently buy from us 
if that happens  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 
if our foundries do not achieve satisfactory yields or quality  our relationships with our customers and our reputation will be harmed 
the fabrication of integrated circuits is a complex and technically demanding process 
our foundries have from time to time experienced manufacturing defects and reduced manufacturing yields 
changes in manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials by our foundries could result in lower than anticipated manufacturing yields or unacceptable performance 
many of these problems are difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and may be time consuming and expensive to correct 
poor yields from our foundries  or defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could cause us significant customer relations and business reputation problems  harm our financial results and result in financial or other damages to our customers 
our customers could also seek damages from us for their losses 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
in addition  defects in our existing or new products could result in significant warranty  support and repair costs  and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts 
when demand for foundry capacity is high  we may take various actions to try to secure sufficient capacity  which may be costly and harm our operating results 
availability of foundry capacity has in the recent past been constrained due to strong demand 
the ability of each foundry to provide us with semiconductor devices is limited by its available capacity and existing obligations 
although we have entered into contractual commitments to supply specified levels of products to some of our customers  we may not have sufficient levels of production capacity with all of our foundries  despite signing a long term guaranteed production capacity agreement with one of our foundries 
despite this agreement  foundry capacity may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices 
we place our orders on the basis of our customers purchase orders or our forecast of customer demand  and the foundries can allocate capacity to the production of other companies products and reduce deliveries to us on short notice 
it is possible that foundry customers that are larger and better financed than we are or that have long term agreements with our main foundries  may induce our foundries to reallocate capacity to those customers 
this reallocation could impair our ability to secure the supply of components that we need 
although we use several independent foundries to manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor products  most of our components are not manufactured at more than one foundry at any given time  and our products typically are designed to be manufactured in a specific process at only one of these foundries 
accordingly  if one of our foundries is unable to provide us with components as needed  we could experience significant delays in securing sufficient supplies of those components 
we cannot assure you that any of our existing or new foundries will be able to produce integrated circuits with acceptable manufacturing yields  or that our foundries will be able to deliver enough semiconductor devices to us on a timely basis  or at reasonable prices 
these and other related factors could impair our ability to meet our customers needs and have a material and adverse effect on our operating results 
in order to secure sufficient foundry capacity when demand is high and mitigate the risks described in the foregoing paragraph  we may enter into various arrangements with suppliers that could be costly and harm our operating results  such as nonrefundable deposits with or loans to foundries in exchange for capacity commitments  and contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of integrated circuits over extended periods 
we may not be able to make any such arrangement in a timely fashion or at all  and any arrangements may be costly  reduce our financial flexibility  and not be on terms favorable to us 
for example  amounts payable under our foundry capacity are non refundable regardless of whether we are able to utilize all of any of the guaranteed wafer capacity under the terms of the agreement 
moreover  if we are able to secure foundry capacity  we may be obligated to use all of that capacity or incur penalties 
these penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results 
the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses or undetected defects or bugs  which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products  damage our reputation with current or prospective customers  and materially and adversely affect our operating costs 
highly complex products  such as the products that we offer  frequently contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  these defects and bugs 
historically  we have been able to design workarounds to fix these defects and bugs with minimal to no disruption to our business or our customers business 
if any of our products contain defects or bugs  or have reliability  quality  or compatibility problems  we may not be able to successfully design workarounds 
consequently  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products  which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers  attract new customers  and our financial results 
in addition  these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers 
to resolve these problems  we may have to invest significant capital and other resources 
although our products are tested by our suppliers  our customers and ourselves  it is possible that our new products will contain defects or bugs 
if any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or replacement costs 
these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others 
in addition  these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts 
moreover  we would likely lose  or experience a delay in  market acceptance of the affected product or products  and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers 
as a result  our financial results could be materially harmed 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration  which may result in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
in order to remain competitive  we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries 
this transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products and to redesign some products 
we periodically evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs 
in the past  we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes  which resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes 
we are dependent on our relationships with our foundry subcontractors to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we cannot assure you that the foundries that we use will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our existing foundry relationships or develop new ones 
if any of our foundry subcontractors or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition  we could experience reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses  all of which could harm our relationships with our customers and our results of operations 
as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality  as well as customer and third party intellectual property  into our products 
however  we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis  if at all 
moreover  even if we are able to achieve higher levels of design integration  such integration may have a short term adverse impact on our operating results  as we may reduce our revenue by integrating the functionality of multiple chips into a single chip 
we have a large amount of debt and our debt service obligations may prevent us from taking actions that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests 
as of january   the aggregate principal amount of our total consolidated debt was million 
covenants in the agreements governing our existing debt  and debt we may incur in the future  may materially restrict our operations  including our ability to incur debt  pay dividends  make certain investments and payments  make acquisitions  and encumber or dispose of assets 
in addition  financial covenants contained in agreements relating to our existing and future debt could lead to a default in the event our results of operations do not meet our plans and we are unable to amend those financial covenants 
a default and acceleration under one debt instrument may also trigger cross acceleration under our other debt instruments 
an event of default under any debt instrument  if not cured or waived  could result in the lenders requiring us to repay the debt  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  the level of our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our future operations  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital and research and development expenditures  and general corporate purposes  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow or our existing cash to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our cash available for other purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures and research and development expenditures  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  or placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources 
we are subject to the risks of owning real property 
our us headquarters located in santa clara  ca  land in singapore  building in malaysia  building in switzerland and buildings in shanghai  china subject us to the risks of owning real property  including the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with fixing any environmental problems  adverse changes in the value of these properties  due to interest rate changes  changes in the neighborhood in which the property is located  or other factors  the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning  seismic and other legal or regulatory requirements  the potential disruption of our business and operations arising from or connected with a relocation due to moving to or renovating the facility  increased cash commitments for improvements to the buildings or the property or both  increased operating expenses for the buildings or the property or both  possible disputes with tenants or other third parties related to the buildings or the property or both  and the risk of financial loss in excess of amounts covered by insurance  or uninsured risks  such as the loss caused by damage to the buildings as a result of an earthquake 
we depend on key personnel with whom we do not have employment agreements to manage our business  and if we are unable to retain our current personnel and hire additional personnel  our ability to develop and successfully market our products could be harmed 
we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering and sales and marketing personnel 
the loss of any key employees or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel  including engineers and sales and marketing personnel  could delay the development and introduction of and harm our ability to sell our products 
we do not have employment contracts with our key personnel  and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace 
there is currently a shortage of qualified technical personnel with significant experience in the design  development  manufacturing  marketing and sales of integrated circuits 
in particular  there is a shortage of engineers who are familiar with the intricacies of the design and manufacture of products based on analog technology  and competition for these engineers is intense 
our key technical personnel represent a significant asset and serve as the source of our technological and product innovations 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of technical personnel to support our anticipated growth 
our officers and directors own a large percentage of our voting stock  and two of them  together with another employee  are also significant shareholders and are related by blood or marriage 
these factors may allow the officers and directors as a group or the three related employees to greatly influence the election of directors and the approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions 
as of march   our executive officers and directors beneficially owned or controlled  directly or indirectly  approximately of the outstanding shares our common stock 
additionally  dr 
sehat sutardja  our chief executive officer  and weili dai  who now serves as our director of strategic marketing and business development  are husband and wife and dr 
sehat sutardja and dr 
pantas sutardja are brothers 
together  these three individuals held approximately of our outstanding common stock as of march  as a result  if the directors and officers as a group or any of dr 
sehat sutardja  weili dai and dr 
pantas sutardja act together  they will significantly influence the election of our directors and the approval or disapproval of our significant corporate actions 
this influence over our affairs might be adverse to the interests of other shareholders 
for instance  the voting power of these officers  directors and others could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of our company on terms that other shareholders may desire 
furthermore  we have a classified board  which could also further delay or prevent an acquisition  under certain circumstances 
under bermuda law all of our officers  in exercising their powers and discharging their duties  must act honestly and in good faith with a view to our best interests and exercise the care  diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances 
majority shareholders do not owe fiduciary duties to minority shareholders 
as a result  the minority shareholders will not have a direct claim against the majority shareholders in the event the majority shareholders take actions that damage the interests of minority shareholders 
class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda  except that bermuda courts would be expected to follow english case law precedent  which would permit a shareholder to bring an action in our name if the directors or officers are alleged to be acting beyond our corporate power  committing illegal acts or violating our memorandum of association or bye laws 
in addition  minority shareholders would be able to challenge a corporate action that allegedly constituted a fraud against them or required the approval of a greater percentage of our shareholders than actually approved it 
the winning party in such an action generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys fees incurred in connection with the action 
we face foreign business  political and economic risks  which may harm our results of operations  because a majority of our products and our customers products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states 
a substantial portion of our business is conducted outside of the united states and  as a result  we are subject to foreign business  political and economic risks 
all of our products are manufactured outside of the united states 
our current qualified integrated circuit foundries are located in the same region within taiwan  and our primary assembly and test subcontractors are located in the pacific rim region 
in addition  many of our customers are located outside of the united states  primarily in asia  which further exposes us to foreign risks 
sales to customers located in asia represented approximately of our net revenue in fiscal  of our net revenue in fiscal  and of our net revenue in fiscal we anticipate that our manufacturing  assembly  testing and sales outside of the united states will continue to account for a substantial portion of our operations and revenue in future periods 
accordingly  we are subject to risks associated with international operations  including difficulties in obtaining domestic and foreign export  import and other governmental approvals  permits and licenses  compliance with foreign laws  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  trade restrictions or higher tariffs  transportation delays  difficulties of managing distributors  especially because we expect to continue to increase our sales through international distributors  political and economic instability  including wars  terrorism  other hostilities and political unrest  boycotts  curtailment of trade and other business restrictions  and inadequate local infrastructure 
because substantially all of our sales to date have been denominated in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar will increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country  potentially leading to a reduction in sales and profitability for us in that country 
a portion of our international revenue may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future  which will subject us to risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates for those foreign currencies 
our third party foundries and subcontractors are concentrated in taiwan and elsewhere in the pan pacific region  an area subject to significant earthquake risks 
any disruption to the operations of these foundries and subcontractors resulting from earthquakes or other natural disasters could cause significant delays in the production or shipment of our products 
substantially all of our products are manufactured by third party foundries located in taiwan 
currently our only alternative manufacturing sources are located in taiwan  china and singapore 
in addition  substantially all of our assembly and testing facilities are located in singapore  taiwan  malaysia and the philippines 
the risk of an earthquake in taiwan and elsewhere in the pacific rim region is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines to the facilities of our foundries and assembly and test subcontractors 
in september  a major earthquake in taiwan affected the facilities of several of these third party contractors 
as a consequence of this earthquake  these contractors suffered power outages and disruptions that impaired their production capacity 
major earthquakes also occurred in taiwan in and although our foundries and subcontractors did not suffer any significant damage as a result of these most recent earthquakes  the occurrence of additional earthquakes or other natural disasters could result in the disruption of our foundry or assembly and test capacity 
any disruption resulting from such events could cause significant delays in the production or shipment of our products until we are able to shift our manufacturing  assembling or testing from the affected contractor to another third party vendor 
we may not be able to obtain alternate capacity on favorable terms  if at all 
the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased rapidly and will likely do so in the future  which could harm our revenues and gross profits 
the products we develop and sell are used for high volume applications 
as a result  the prices of those products have historically decreased rapidly 
our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes  reducing our costs  or developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profits 
we expect that our gross profits on our products are likely to decrease over the next fiscal year below levels we have historically experienced due to pricing pressures from our customers  an increase in sales of storage socs  which typically have lower margins than standalone read channel devices  and an increase in sales of wireless and other products into consumer application markets  which are highly competitive and cost sensitive 
additionally  because we do not operate our own manufacturing  assembly or testing facilities  we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities  and our costs may even increase  which could also reduce our margins 
in the past  we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures  new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors 
we expect that we will have to do so again in the future 
we have a lengthy and expensive product sales cycle that does not assure product sales  and that if unsuccessful  may harm our operating results 
the sales cycle for many of our products is long and requires us to invest significant resources with each potential customer without any assurance of sales to that customer 
our sales cycle typically begins with an extended evaluation and test period  also known as qualification  during which our products undergo rigorous reliability testing by our customers 
qualification is typically followed by an extended development period by our customers and an additional three to six month period before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products 
this lengthy sales cycle creates the risk that our customers will decide to cancel or change product plans for products incorporating our integrated circuits 
during our sales cycle  our engineers assist customers in implementing our products into the customers products 
we incur significant research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses as part of this process  and this process may never generate related revenues 
we derive revenue from this process only if our design is selected 
once a customer selects a particular integrated circuit for use in its product  the customer generally uses solely that integrated circuit for a full generation of its product 
therefore  if we do not achieve a design win for a product  we will be unable to sell our integrated circuit to a customer until that customer develops a new product or a new generation of its product 
even if we achieve a design win with a customer  the customer may not ultimately ship products incorporating our products or may cancel orders after we have achieved a sale 
in addition  we will have to begin the qualification process again when a customer develops a new generation of a product for which we were the successful supplier 
also  during the final production of a mature product  our customers typically exhaust their existing inventory of our integrated circuits 
consequently  orders for our products may decline in those circumstances  even if our products are incorporated into both our customers mature and replacement products 
a delay in a customer s transition to commercial production of a replacement product may cause the customer to lose sales  which would delay our ability to recover the lost sales from the discontinued mature product 
in addition  customers may defer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements from our competitors or us 
we must keep pace with rapid technological change and evolving industry standards in the semiconductor industry to remain competitive 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards and our customers changing demands 
we sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and increasing demand for higher levels of integration and smaller process geometries 
our past sales and profitability have resulted  to a large extent  from our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products incorporating the new standards and technologies 
our ability to adapt to these changes and to anticipate future standards  and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards  will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth 
if new industry standards emerge  our products or our customers products could become unmarketable or obsolete  and we could lose market share 
we may also have to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards 
in addition  our target markets continue to undergo rapid growth and consolidation 
a significant slowdown in any of these markets could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success will also depend on the ability of our customers to develop new products and enhance existing products for the markets we serve and to introduce and promote those products successfully 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property  which would negatively affect our ability to compete 
we believe one of our key competitive advantages results from our collection of proprietary technologies that we have developed since our inception 
if we fail to protect these intellectual property rights  competitors could sell products based on technology that we have developed which could harm our competitive position and decrease our revenues 
we believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is and will continue to be important to the success of our business 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies 
we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and business partners  and control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
we have been issued several united states patents and have a number of pending united states patent applications 
however  a patent may not be issued as a result of any applications or  if issued  claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
despite our efforts  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or proprietary technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult  and the steps that we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we may become involved with costly and lengthy litigation  which could subject us to liability  require us to stop selling our products or force us to redesign our products 
litigation involving patents and other intellectual property is widespread in the high technology industry and is particularly prevalent in the integrated circuit industry  where a number of companies aggressively bring numerous infringement claims to protect their patent portfolios 
from time to time we receive  and may continue to receive in the future  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused the proprietary rights of other parties 
these claims could result in litigation  which  in turn  could subject us to significant liability for damages 
any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling products or using technology that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property  pay substantial damages to the party claiming infringement that could adversely impact our liquidity or operating results  attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  and attempt to redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
in addition  many of our contracts with our customers require us to indemnify our customers against claims alleging infringement of the proprietary rights of other parties 
customers have requested us to indemnify them in connection with a patent infringement lawsuit by australia s commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro 
we have also filed an action against csiro seeking a declaratory judgment that csiro s patent is invalid and unenforceable and that we and our customers do not infringe the csiro patent 
we are also party to other claims and litigation proceedings arising in the normal course of business 
the impact on us as a result of such claims and litigation cannot currently be ascertained 
any litigation  regardless of the outcome  is time consuming and expensive to resolve  may require us to pay significant monetary damages and can divert management time and attention 
an unfavorable ruling in litigation could require us to pay damages or one time license fees or royalty payments  which could adversely impact gross margins in future periods  or could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products or limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved in such litigation may perform for us 
there can be no assurance that these matters will be resolved in a manner that is not adverse to our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we are incorporated in bermuda  and  as a result  it may not be possible for our shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states 
we are organized under the laws of bermuda 
as a result  it may not be possible for our shareholders to effect service of process within the united states upon us  or to enforce against us in united states courts judgments based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states 
most of our executive officers and directors are residents of the united states 
however  there is significant doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state or hear actions brought in bermuda against us or those persons based on those laws 
the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 
therefore  a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability  whether or not based solely on united states federal or state securities laws  would not be automatically enforceable in bermuda 
our bye laws contain a waiver of claims or rights of action by our shareholders against our officers and directors  which will severely limit our shareholders right to assert a claim against our officers and directors under bermuda law 
our bye laws contain a broad waiver by our shareholders of any claim or right of action  both individually and on our behalf  against any of our officers and directors 
the waiver applies to any action taken by an officer or director  or the failure of an officer or director to take any action  in the performance of his or her duties with or for us  other than with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the officer or director 
this waiver will limit the rights of our shareholders to assert claims against our officers and directors unless the act complained of involves actual fraud or dishonesty 
thus  so long as acts of business judgment do not involve actual fraud or dishonesty  they will not be subject to shareholder claims under bermuda law 
for example  shareholders will not have claims against officers and directors for a breach of trust  unless the breach rises to the level of actual fraud or dishonesty 
tax benefits we receive may be terminated or reduced in the future  which would increase our costs 
under current bermuda law  we are not subject to tax on our income and capital gains 
we have obtained from the minister of finance of bermuda under the exempt undertakings tax protection act  as amended  an undertaking that  in the event that bermuda enacts any legislation imposing tax computed on income and capital gains  those taxes should not apply to us until march  however  it is possible that this exemption would not be extended beyond that date 
the economic development board of singapore granted pioneer status to our wholly owned subsidiary in singapore in july initially  this tax exemption was to expire after ten years  but the economic development board in june agreed to extend the term to fifteen years 
as a result  we anticipate that a significant portion of the income we earn in singapore during this period will be exempt from the singapore income tax 
we are required to meet several requirements as to investment  headcount and activities in singapore to retain this status 
if our pioneer status is terminated early  our financial results could be harmed 
as a result of the pioneer status  there was a tax savings of million in fiscal in an earnings per share benefit of 
the israeli government has granted approved enterprise status to two of our wholly owned subsidiaries in israel  which provides a tax holiday on undistributed income derived from operations within certain development regions in israel 
in order to maintain our qualification  we must continue to meet specified conditions  including the making of investments in fixed assets in israel 
as our tax holidays expire  we expect that we will start paying income tax on our operations within these development regions 
in fiscal  the israeli subsidiaries were not profitable and did not have any benefit from the tax incentive 
during fiscal  our switzerland subsidiary received from both federal and cantonal purposes a ten year tax holiday on design and research centre and wafer supply trading activity revenues earned in switzerland 
each jurisdiction has separate requirements that need to be met such as the ten year business requirement and investment in head count  intellectual property  office equipment  software and other expense items 
if the requirements are not met  there would be tax dollars to be paid which may affect our financial results 
as a result of the swiss holiday  our switzerland subsidiary benefited from an income tax savings of million  which did not have a significant earnings per share benefit 
class action litigation due to stock price volatility or other factors could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
on september   a putative class action was filed in the southern district of new york relating to our initial public offering  or ipo 
in this action  the plaintiffs named several defendants including marvell and two of our officers  one of whom is also a director 
this complaint relating to our ipo has been consolidated with hundreds of other lawsuits by plaintiffs against approximately underwriters and approximately issuers across the united states 
plaintiffs allege that defendants violated various provisions of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of in these actions  plaintiffs seek  among other items  unspecified damages  pre judgment interest and reimbursement of attorneys and experts fees 
a consolidated amended class action complaint against marvell and two of our officers was filed on april  subsequently  defendants in the consolidated proceedings moved to dismiss the actions 
in february  the trial court issued its ruling on the motions  granting the motions in part  and denying them in part 
thus  the cases may proceed against the underwriters and us as to alleged violations of section of the securities act of and section b of the securities exchange act of claims against the individual officers have been voluntarily dismissed with prejudice by agreement with plaintiffs 
on june   the plaintiffs announced that a settlement among plaintiffs  the issuer defendants and their directors and officers  and their insurers had been structured  a part of which the insurers for all issuer defendants would guarantee up to billion to investors who are class members  depending upon plaintiffs success against non settling parties 
our board of directors has approved the proposed settlement  which  if approved by the court would result in the plaintiffs dismissing the case against us and granting releases that extend to all of our officers and directors 
the court issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement in august and held a public hearing on its fairness in april the court has not yet ruled following the public hearing 
these claims and any resulting litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert the attention and resources of our management 
in the past  securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
companies in the integrated circuit industry and other technology industries are particularly vulnerable to this kind of litigation due to the high volatility of their stock prices 
accordingly  we may in the future be the target of securities litigation 
any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert the attention and resources of our management 
our bye laws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in corporate control  even if the change in corporate control would benefit our shareholders 
our bye laws contain change in corporate control provisions  which include authorizing the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval  providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  and requiring a vote of two thirds of the outstanding shares to approve any change of corporate control 
these changes in corporate control provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be a benefit to our shareholders
