item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of results we are a leading provider of sales performance management spm and enterprise incentive management eim software systems to global companies 
large enterprises use spm eim systems to model  administer  analyze and report on sales performance or incentive management plans that compensate employees and distribution channel partners 
we sell our products both directly through our sales force and in conjunction with our strategic partners pursuant to perpetual or term software licenses 
we also offer professional services  including configuration  integration and training  generally on a time and materials basis 
we generate maintenance and support revenues 
table of contents associated with our product licenses  which are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement 
in  we began offering on demand services to our customers 
on demand services allow customers to use our software products as a service by outsourcing the daily technical operation  maintenance  upgrades and other levels of support to us 
we currently have two on demand services offerings hosted and managed services 
our hosted on demand service allows customers to use our software products through a web interface rather than purchasing computer equipment and installing our software at their location 
our managed services on demand offering allows customers with an on premise installation of our software to outsource the operation and management of our software products to us 
both of these on demand offerings provide for recurring revenue streams  but remain subject to periodic adjustment or cancellation 
our managed services on demand offering was launched in the first quarter of and our hosted on demand offering was launched in the second quarter of for  revenues from our hosted on demand services have not been material 
revenue growth we experienced substantial revenue growth in compared to total revenues increased by to million for compared to the increase was primarily the result of a growth in license revenues in compared to we attribute the license revenue growth to a number of factors  including increased spending on our sales and marketing efforts  a more strategic product offering that included the release of our callidus trueanalytics product  and an improved macro economic environment for software related spending 
all of these factors contributed to a larger number of license revenue transactions in compared to our maintenance and service revenues increased by to million for compared to the increase is primarily due to higher software maintenance revenues and consulting services  including our new on demand managed service offering 
both software maintenance and consulting revenues were positively affected by the growth in license revenues 
increased expenses to support growth strategy in an effort to accelerate revenue growth and extend our leadership position in the spm and eim market  we made a conscious decision to increase spending in primarily in sales and marketing and software development 
we made investments in expanding sales coverage both in the us and internationally  developing and launching new products and services  including callidus trueanalytics  on demand solutions  and new value added consulting services  and increasing marketing efforts 
in addition  general and administration expenses increased as a result of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and the increase of stock based compensation 
as a result of these efforts and the impact of new accounting rules requiring the expensing of stock based compensation  operating expenses increased by to million including an increase in stock based compensation of million for compared to additionally  investments in international expansion of our services organization  the introduction of our on demand offering and a million increase in stock based compensation expense negatively impacted the gross margin related to maintenance and service revenues  which decreased from for to for management believes these investments are in the best interests of the business 
despite these increased expenses  our net loss only increased by million to million for  compared with a net loss of million for because of the company s adoption of fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment  total stock based compensation expense increased by million in compared to growth strategy continues but expense growth should be slower for  we expect to maintain our management and operational focus on revenue growth 
we expect the growth rate of operating expenses to slow as we seek to leverage the investments made in 
table of contents other business highlights during  our flagship product  truecomp  earned the certified for sap netweaver status which allows our customers to leverage the sap netweaver platform to deploy our solutions on the same framework as their sap solutions 
this status was upgraded later in the year to powered by sap netweaver status  indicating an even higher level of product integration on the netweaver platform 
in september  we entered into an agreement with sap allowing them to promote and market our truecomp and trueinformation products in the united states and canada 
in december  truecomp became an sap endorsed business solution 
we and sap completed the first joint sale of our products in the fourth quarter 
we also entered into partnership arrangements with hyperion and the terralign group to offer new products focused on sales performance management 
the hyperion agreement allows us to incorporate hyperion technology in an application focused on sales quota planning  modeling and assignment to sales management and field representatives 
the terralign group agreement allows us to promote terralign  an advanced territory design and optimization application 
the addition of these partners and products broadens our product offerings and we believe makes our product offerings more competitive in the sales performance management space 
we had no revenue in resulting from these partnership arrangements 
challenges and risks from a business perspective  we have a number of sales opportunities in process and additional opportunities coming from our sales pipeline  however  we continue to experience wide variances in the timing and size of our license transactions and the timing of revenue recognition resulting from greater flexibility in licensing terms  including our customers ability to select the delivery of our software via on demand services 
we believe one of our major remaining challenges is increasing prospective customers prioritization of purchasing our products and services over competing it projects 
to address this challenge  we have set goals that include expanding our sales efforts  promoting our new on demand services  and continuing to develop new products and enhancements to our truecomp suite of products 
if we are unable to grow our revenues  we may be unable to achieve and sustain profitability 
in addition to these risks  our future operating performance is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in risk factors in section a of this annual report on form k 
application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations which follows is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the application of gaap requires our management to make estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure regarding these items 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  our use of estimates and the related disclosures with our audit committee 

table of contents revenue recognition we generate revenues primarily by licensing software and providing related software maintenance and professional services to our customers 
we also generate revenue by providing our software application as a service through our on demand offerings 
we recognize revenues in accordance with accounting standards for software and service companies 
we will not recognize revenue until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is deemed probable 
we evaluate each of these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement 
we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by us and the customer to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery 
in perpetual licensing arrangements  we consider delivery to have occurred when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier  or in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given access to the licensed programs 
our typical end user license agreement does not include customer acceptance provisions 
in on demand arrangements  we consider delivery to have occurred when the service has been provided to the customer 
fixed or determinable fee 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within our standard payment terms 
we consider payment terms greater than days to be beyond our customary payment terms 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable 
in arrangements where the customer is obligated to pay at least of the license amount within normal payment terms and the remaining is to be paid within a year from the contract effective date  we will recognize the license revenue for the entire arrangement upon delivery assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
this policy is effective as long as we continue to maintain a history of providing similar terms to customers and collecting from those customers without providing any contractual concessions 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we defer the recognition of revenue until cash collection 
perpetual licensing 
our perpetual software arrangements typically include i an end user license fee paid in exchange for the use of our products  generally based on a specified number of payees  and ii a maintenance arrangement that provides for technical support and product updates  generally over renewable twelve month periods 
if we are selected to provide integration and configuration services  then the software arrangement will also include professional services  generally priced on a time and materials basis 
depending upon the elements in the arrangement and the terms of the related agreement  we recognize license revenues under either the residual or the contract accounting method 
certain arrangements result in the payment of customer referral fees to third parties that resell our software products 
in these arrangements  license revenues are recorded  net of such referral fees  at the time the software license has been delivered to a third party reseller and an end user customer has been identified 
residual method 
license fees are recognized upon delivery whether licenses are sold separately from or together with integration and configuration services  provided that i the criteria described above have been met  ii payment of the license fees is not dependent upon performance of the integration and configuration services  and iii the services are not otherwise essential to the functionality of the software 
we recognize these license revenues using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under the residual method  revenues are recognized when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement ie  professional services and maintenance  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement ie  the software product 
each license arrangement requires careful analysis to ensure that all of the individual elements in the license transaction have been identified  along with the fair value of each undelivered element 

table of contents we allocate revenue to each undelivered element based on its respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
for a certain class of transactions  the fair value of the maintenance portion of our arrangements is based on stated renewal rates rather than stand alone sales 
the fair value of the professional services portion of the arrangement is based on the hourly rates that we charge for these services when sold independently from a software license 
if evidence of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of a license agreement  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred until evidence of fair value can be established  or until the items for which evidence of fair value cannot be established are delivered 
if the only undelivered element is maintenance  then the entire amount of revenue is recognized over the maintenance delivery period 
contract accounting method 
for arrangements where services are considered essential to the functionality of the software  such as where the payment of the license fees is dependent upon performance of the services  both the license and services revenues are recognized in accordance with the provisions of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
we generally use the percentage of completion method because we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates relative to contract costs and the extent of progress toward completion 
however  if we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates  we use the completed contract method 
if total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated loss on the arrangement 
in certain arrangements  we have provided for unique acceptance criteria associated with the delivery of consulting services 
in these instances  we have recognized revenue in accordance with the provisions of sop to the extent there is contingent revenue in these arrangements  we measure the level of profit that is expected based on the non contingent revenue and the total expected project costs 
if we are assured of a certain level of profit excluding the contingent revenue  we recognize the non contingent revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
maintenance revenue 
a customer typically pre pays maintenance for the first twelve months  and the related revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the initial maintenance contract 
maintenance is renewable by the customer on an annual basis thereafter 
rates for maintenance  including subsequent renewal rates  are typically established based upon a specified percentage of net license fees as set forth in the arrangement 
professional service revenue 
professional service revenues primarily consist of configuration and integration services related to the installation and configuration of our products as well as training 
our installation and configuration services do not involve customization to  or development of  the underlying software code 
substantially all of our professional services arrangements are on a time and materials basis 
for professional service arrangements with a fixed fee  we recognize revenue utilizing the proportional performance method of accounting 
we estimate the proportional performance on fixed fee contracts on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress toward completion  revenue is recognized upon completion of performance 
to the extent we enter into a fixed fee services contract  a loss will be recognized any time the total estimated project cost exceeds project revenues 
on demand revenue 
on demand revenues include both managed and hosted service offerings and are recorded as maintenance and services revenues in our statements of operations 
our on demand offerings allow our customers to outsource the operation and management of our software products to us 
managed services are generally sold under long term renewable contracts with minimum purchase commitments 
revenues from the managed service offering are generally recognized on a time and materials basis for both the initial customer set up and the ongoing operation and management of the software 
in hosted arrangements where we provide our software application as a service  we considered emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  and concluded that generally these transactions are considered service arrangements and fall outside of the scope of sop accordingly  we follow the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
customers will typically prepay for our hosted offering services  amounts which we will defer and recognize ratably over the non cancellable term of the customer contract 
we evaluate whether each of the elements in these arrangements represents a separate 
table of contents unit of accounting  as defined by eitf  using all applicable facts and circumstances  including whether i we sell or could readily sell the element unaccompanied by the other elements  ii the element has stand alone value to the customer  iii there is objective reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item and iv there is a general right of return 
for those arrangements where the elements qualify for separate units of accounting  the hosting revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the service commencement date 
implementation and configuration services  when sold with the hosted offering  are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts  and for fixed price contracts they are recognized utilizing the proportional performance method of accounting 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate the total contractual arrangement to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  as determined by the fair value of the undelivered and delivered items when sold separately 
if a consulting arrangement for implementation and configuration services associated with a hosted on demand engagement does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting  we will recognize the revenue from implementation and configuration services ratably over the remaining non cancellable term of the subscription contract once the implementation is complete 
in addition  we defer the direct costs of the implementation and configuration services and amortize those costs over the same time period as the related revenue is recognized 
if the direct costs incurred for a contract exceed the non cancelable contract value  then we would recognize a loss for incurred and projected direct costs in excess of the contract value 
the deferred costs on our consolidated balance sheet for these consulting arrangements totaled million and at december  and december   respectively 
included in the deferred costs for hosting arrangements is the deferral of commission payments to our direct sales force  which we amortize over the non cancellable term of the contract as the related revenue is recognized 
the commission payments are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements 
the deferral of commission expenditures related to our hosted on demand product offerings was million and at december  and december   respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return reserve we must make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  which is netted against accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets  totaled approximately  and  at december  and december   respectively 
we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  international situations such as currency devaluation and changes in our customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
specifically  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  affecting their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required and such provision may be material 
we generally warrant that our services will be performed in accordance with the criteria agreed upon in a statement of work  which we generally execute with each applicable customer prior to commencing work 
should these services not be performed in accordance with the agreed upon criteria  we typically provide remediation services until such time as the criteria are met 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists  management must use judgments and make estimates of sales return reserves related to potential future requirements to provide remediation services in connection with current period service revenues 
when providing for sales return reserves  we analyze historical experience of actual remediation service claims as well as current information on remediation service requests as they are the primary indicators for estimating future service claims 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenues if  for any period  actual returns differ from management s judgments or estimates 
the sales return reserve balance  which is netted against our accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets  was approximately  and  at december  and december   respectively 

table of contents impairment of purchased technology and intangible assets in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
in  as a result of a decline in financial performance  we assessed whether the purchased technology and other intangible assets acquired from cezanne software were impaired 
we compared the carrying amount of the asset group to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
based on this assessment  we determined the asset group had no value and recorded an impairment charge of million as a cost of revenues and million as an operating expense 
the million impairment related to unamortized capitalized software costs 
the million impairment consisted of a million impairment to an assembled workforce intangible asset and an approximately  impairment of a favorable lease asset 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance  market conditions  and other factors 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning 
as of december  and december   we had no remaining intangible assets 
stock based compensation effective january   we began recording stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and other forms of equity compensation in accordance with fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment sfas r  as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sfas r requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation in net income 
the guidance in sfas r and sab is relatively new 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
refer to note stock based compensation in our notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for further discussion of our adoption of sfas r 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes 
this process involves estimating actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on our balance sheet 
our deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carry forwards 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized 
we maintained a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at december  while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgment and is subject to audit by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business

table of contents percentage of dollar year ended percentage year ended percentage year to year change december  of related december  of related increase year over revenues revenues decrease year cost of revenues license maintenance and service total cost of revenues gross profit revenues license revenues 
license revenues increased million or in the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of license sales to new and existing customers 
the average license revenue per transaction in was million compared to million in we had nine transactions in with a license value over million compared to six such transactions in we expect our license revenues to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter since we generally complete a relatively small number of transactions in a quarter and the revenue on those software license sales can vary widely 
maintenance and service revenues 
maintenance and service revenues increased by million or in the increase is primarily the result of an increase of million in maintenance revenues in other services  including implementation and on demand increased by million in the improvement in both of these areas was driven by the growth in license revenues 
we plan to continue to invest in our new on demand and other services offerings  but we cannot predict how quickly  if at all  these offerings will achieve market acceptance 
in addition  service revenues may be negatively affected to the extent our customers select a third party to implement our software rather than us 
cost of revenues and gross margin cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues increased by million or in the increase was primarily the result of royalties paid on license revenues related to our callidus trueanalytics product  which was released in december  and on the increased number of license transactions as discussed above 
in  we entered into an agreement with hyperion for the sublicense of its technology for an application focused on sales quota planning  modeling and assignment to sales management and field representatives  which may bear a higher royalty percentage than our other licensed technology 
accordingly  if sales of this application become significant  our license gross margins could be affected 
otherwise  we expect license gross margins to remain at or above 
cost of maintenance and service revenues 
cost of maintenance and service revenues increased by million or in the increase  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of related revenues  is primarily due to international expansion of our services organization  the introduction of our on demand offering and a million increase in stock based compensation resulting from the adoption of sfas r 
gross margin 
our overall gross margin increased to in from in the increase in our gross margin is attributable primarily to the shift in revenue mix to higher margin license revenues  which represented of our total revenues in compared to in in the future  we expect our gross margins to fluctuate depending primarily on the mix of license versus maintenance and service revenues

under apb no 
 we were generally required to record compensation expense only if there were positive differences between the market value of our common stock and the exercise price of the options granted to employees on the date of the 
table of contents grant 
under sfas r  however  we record compensation expense for all share based payments made to employees based on the fair value at the date of the grant

cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was  and for and  respectively  and resulted from the change in accounting principle from apb no 
to sfas r 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulted from the requirement of sfas r to reduce the amount of stock based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate or  in other words  the estimated number of shares that are not expected to vest as a result of an employee terminating prior to becoming fully vested in an award 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we did not reduce stock based compensation expense based on an estimated forfeiture rate but rather recorded an adjustment to stock based compensation as actual forfeitures occurred 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is generally one time in nature and not expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

table of contents interest rate risk 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting primarily of investments in money market accounts  high quality corporate debt obligations and united states government obligations 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
all of our investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value  which is determined based on quoted market prices  with net unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities  that typically have a shorter duration  may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our investment income may decrease in the future due to changes in interest rates 
at december   the average maturity of our investments was approximately five months and all investment securities had maturities of less than twenty four months 
the following table presents certain information about our financial instruments at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands  except for interest rates expected maturity total total year more than principal fair or less year amount value available for sale securities weighted average interest rate our exposure to market risk also relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments 
we paid all term loans in full as of december  therefore  we currently have no exposure to market risk related to our outstanding debt instruments 
to the extent we enter into or issue debt instruments in the future  we will have interest expense market risk 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenues and our expenses  except those related to our united kingdom  germany and australia operations  are generally denominated in united states dollars 
for the year ended december   we earned approximately of our revenue from our international operations 
of this revenue from our international operations  was denominated in united states dollars 
as a result  we have relatively little exposure to currency exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been minimal to date 
we expect to continue to do a majority of our business in united states dollars 
occasionally  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency exposures 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million notional amount of short term foreign currency forward exchange contracts denominated in british pounds outstanding 
unrealized gains and losses related to the forward exchange contracts for the year ended december  were not material 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the future 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately 
in particular  generally  we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure 
we cannot assure you that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure 
failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 

table of contents the following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of december  there were no forward exchange contracts as of december  all of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts mature within the next months
