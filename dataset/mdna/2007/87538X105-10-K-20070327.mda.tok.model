summary we are the world s largest specialty retailer and wholesale distributor of leather and leathercraft related items 
our operations are centered on operating retail and wholesale stores 
we have built our business by offering our customers quality products in one location at competitive prices 
the key to our success is our ability to grow our base business 
we grow that business by opening new locations and by increasing sales in our existing locations 
we intend to continue to expand both domestically  in the short term  and internationally  in the long term 
we operate in three segments 
first  wholesale leathercraft  consisting of our leather factory stores and our national account group  is the largest source of revenues million in 
this division has generally offered steady but modest increases in sales 
sales in declined  short of our target of annual sales growth of to 
the decrease in sales to national accounts in accounted for the shortfall 
excluding national account sales  the stores produced a sales gain of for since acquiring its assets in  we have focused on re establishing tandy leather as the operator of retail leathercraft stores 
these retail stores comprise our second segment  retail leathercraft 
because of growth here  this segment has experienced the greatest increases in sales million in  up from million in 
our business plan calls for opening an average of stores annually as we work toward a goal of stores from stores at the end of we refer to our third segment as other 
it consists of roberts  cushman  a supplier of trimmings for headwear 
its operations are not material to us 
in  we wrote off the goodwill related to our investment in roberts  cushman in connection with an accounting change 
on a consolidated basis  a key indicator of costs  gross margin as a percent of total net sales  increased in and again in  reflecting a number of factors including more retail sales with higher profit margins 
operating expenses as a percent of total net sales in decreased from operating expenses were down as a percentage of total net sales in when compared with we reported consolidated net income for of million 
consolidated net income for and was million and million  respectively 
we have used our cash flow to fund our operations  to fund the opening of new tandy leather stores and to eliminate our bank debt 
at the end of  our stockholders equity had increased to million from million the previous year 
comparing the december  balance sheet with the prior year s  we increased our investments in inventory million from million and accounts receivable million from million  while total cash increased to million from million 
in addition to cash on hand  we have a million bank line of credit  of which none was drawn on december  net sales net sales for the three years ended december  were as follows year wholesale leathercraft retail leathercraft other total company total company incr from prior year our net sales grew by in when compared with and in when compared with these annual increases resulted primarily from our retail leathercraft expansion program 

table of contents costs and expenses in general  our gross profit as a percentage of sales our gross margin fluctuates based on the mix of customers we serve  the mix of products we sell  and our ability to source products globally 
our negotiations with suppliers for lower pricing are an on going process and we have varying degrees of success in those endeavors 
sales to retail customers tend to produce higher gross margins than sales to wholesale customers due to the difference in pricing levels 
therefore  as retail sales increase in the overall sales mix  higher gross margins tend to follow 
finally  there is significant fluctuation in gross margins between the various merchandise categories we offer 
as a result  our gross margins can vary depending on the mix of products sold during any given time period 
for  our cost of sales decreased as a percentage of total net sales when compared to  resulting in an overall increase of in our consolidated gross margin from in to in similarly  our total cost of sales as a percentage of our total net sales had decreased for when compared to resulting in an overall increase in consolidated gross margin of from for to in these increases in gross margin were primarily due to increased retail sales over the three years

table of contents wholesale leathercraft year net sales incr decr from prior yr operating income operating income incr decr from prior year operating income as a percentage of sales wholesale leathercraft  consisting of leather factory stores  accounted for of our consolidated net sales in  which compares to in and in the decrease in this division s contribution to our total net sales is the result of the growth in retail leathercraft and we expect this trend to continue 
sales in the stores increased in compared to sales in  but this gain was offset by a sales decline in our national account group 
by customer group  we achieved gains to our retail and small manufacturing customers while our sales to our wholesale customers declined slightly 
our sales mix by customer group was as follows customer group retail institution wholesale national accounts manufacturers the increase in operating income as a percentage of divisional sales resulted from an increase of in gross margin as a percentage of sales compared with  and a decrease of in operating expenses as a percent of sales 
significant operating expense decreases occurred in contributions  various bank fees  legal and professional fees  depreciation  and advertising costs 
these reductions were partially offset by increases in employee wages  and general supplies 
the increase in operating income as a percentage of divisional sales resulted from an increase of in gross margin as a percentage of sales compared with  and a decrease of in operating expenses as a percent of sales 
significant operating expense decreases occurred in employee benefits  various insurance costs  legal and professional fees  and outside services 
these reductions were partially offset by increases in manager bonuses  and advertising and marketing expenses 
retail leathercraft year net sales increase from prior yr operating income operating income incr decr from prior year operating income as a percentage of sales reflecting the growth previously discussed  retail leathercraft accounted for of our total net sales in  up from in and in growth in net sales for retail leathercraft division in and resulted primarily from our expansion program

the current facility matures in october and is secured by our accounts receivable and inventory 
we opted to reduce the maximum amount that may be borrowed under this line of credit to million in order to reduce the fees required on the un borrowed portion of the line 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants and conditions contained in the jpmorgan chase credit agreement and have no reason to believe that we will not continue to operate in compliance with the provisions of these financing arrangements 
the principal terms and conditions of the credit agreement are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  notes payable and long term debt 
we borrow and repay funds under revolving credit terms as needed 
the principal balance has been zero since the first quarter of we have not borrowed and repaid funds since that time 
total bank indebtedness at the end of and is zero 
reflecting the reduction of bank indebtedness during the periods  our financing activities for  and provided required net cash of   and million  respectively 
the primary source of liquidity and capital resources during was cash flow provided by operating activities 
cash flow from operations for and was million and million  respectively  the largest portion generated from net income partially offset by the increase in inventory 
cash flow from operations in was million 
consolidated accounts receivable increased to million at december  compared to million at december  average days to collect accounts slowed from days in to days in on a consolidated basis due primarily to the suspension of payments from a large customer due to a processing error on the part of the customer 
the problem was resolved and we expect to collect the backlog of payments by the end of the first quarter of 
table of contents inventory increased from million at the end of to million at december  we expect our inventory to slowly trend upward as we continue our expansion of the tandy leather store chain 
we attempt to manage our inventory levels to avoid tying up excessive capital while maintaining sufficient inventory in order to service our current customer demand as well as plan for our expected store growth and expansion 
while we believe our investment in inventory at the end of was at a reasonable level given our expansion plans  it was approximately above our internal targets of optimum inventory levels 
consolidated inventory turned times during  a slight slow down from the times turned in we compute our inventory turnover rates as sales divided by average inventory 
by operating division  inventory turns are as follows segment wholesale leathercraft retail leathercraft roberts  cushman wholesale leathercraft stores only retail leathercraft inventory turns are significantly higher than that of wholesale leathercraft because its inventory consists only of the inventory at the stores 
the tandy leather stores have no warehouse backstock inventory to include in the turnover computation as the stores get their product from the central warehouse 
wholesale leathercraft s turns are expected to be slower because the central warehouse inventory is part of this division and its inventory is held as the backstock for all of the stores 
accounts payable increased to million at the end of compared to million at the end of due primarily to the intentional slowdown in payments to vendors 
we were paying ahead of terms in many cases in which resulted in the lower accounts payable balance at december  as discussed above  the largest use of operating cash in was for inventory purchases and increase in accounts receivable 
capital expenditures totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  capital expenditures consisted of factory machines and dies  fixtures and equipment for the new tandy leather retail stores  air conditioner replacements at existing stores  leather display racks  computer server upgrades  and miscellaneous computer and other office equipment 
since we intend to continue opening or acquiring new tandy leather stores  expenditures related to this expansion should continue into we believe that cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operations in  while also funding expansion 
at this time  we know of no trends or demands  commitments events or uncertainties that will or are likely to materially affect our liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
in addition  we anticipate that this cash flow will enable us to meet the contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
however  if cash flows should decrease or uses of cash increase  we may increase our borrowings on our line of credit as needed 
we believe that  if desired  our present financial condition would permit us to increase the maximum amount that could be borrowed from lenders 
further  we could defer expansion plans if required by unanticipated drops in cash flow 
in particular  because of the relatively small investment required by each new tandy leather store  we have flexibility in when we make most expansion expenditures 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements during  and  and we do not currently have any such arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes by years our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  not including related interest expense payments due by periods contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations our loan from jpmorgan chase matures in october the loan s maturity can be accelerated in the event of a material adverse change or upon other occurrences described in the related credit agreement 
these are our leased facilities 
the interest rate on the capital lease is 
any imputed interest over the term of the lease would be insignificant 
summary of critical accounting policies we strive to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner  although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology 
we follow generally accepted accounting principles in the us in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these principles require us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
we continually review our accounting policies  how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements 
basis of consolidation 
we report our financial information on a consolidated basis 
therefore  unless there is an indication to the contrary  financial information is provided for the parent company  tandy leather factory  inc  and its subsidiaries as a whole 
transactions between the parent company and any subsidiaries are eliminated for this purpose 
we own all of the capital stock of our subsidiaries  and we do not have any subsidiaries that are not consolidated 
none of our subsidiaries are off balance sheet 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for retail over the counter sales as transactions occur and other sales upon shipment of our products  provided that there are no significant post delivery obligations to the customer and collection is reasonably assured  which generally occurs upon shipment 
net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances  product returns  and allowances for defective merchandise 
allowance for accounts receivable 
we reduce accounts receivable by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
this allowance is an estimate based primarily on our evaluation of the customer s financial condition  past collection history  and the aging of the account 
if the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment or inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and is accounted for on the first in  first out method 
this means that sales of inventory treat the oldest item of identical inventory as being the first sold 
in addition  we regularly reduce the value of our inventory for slow moving or obsolete inventory 
this reduction is based on our review of items on hand compared to their estimated future demand 
if actual future demand is less favorable than what we project  additional write downs may be necessary 
goods shipped to us are recorded as inventory owned by us when the risk of loss shifts to us from the supplier 
goodwill 
a change in the accounting rules necessitated a change in in how we report goodwill on our balance sheet 
as a result  we incurred an impairment write down in of our investment in roberts  cushman in the amount of million 
we periodically analyze the remaining goodwill on our balance sheet to determine the appropriateness of its carry value 
as of december   we determined that the present value of the discounted estimated future cash flows of the stores associated with the goodwill is sufficient to support their respective goodwill balances 
if actual results of these stores differ significantly from our projections  such difference could affect the present value calculation in the future resulting in an impairment of all or part of the goodwill currently carried on our balance sheet 

table of contents forward looking statements item business and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report contain forward looking statements of management 
in general  these are predictions or suggestions of future events and statements or expectations of future occurrences 
there are important risks that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated by some of the forward looking statements 
some  but not all  of the important risks which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements include  among other things we might fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the opening of tandy leather retail stores or we might be unable to obtain sufficient new locations on acceptable terms to meet our growth plans 
further  we might fail to hire and train competent managers to oversee the stores opened 
political considerations here and abroad could disrupt our sources of supplies from abroad or affect the prices we pay for goods 
continued involvement by the united states in war and other military operations in the middle east and other areas abroad could disrupt international trade and affect our inventory sources 
a slump in the economy in the united states  as well as abroad  may cause our sales to decrease or not to increase or adversely affect the prices charged for our products 
also  hostilities  terrorism or other events could worsen this condition 
as a result of the on going threat of terrorist attacks on the united states  consumer buying habits could change and decrease our sales 
livestock diseases such as mad cow could reduce the availability of hides and leathers or increase their cost 
also  the prices of hides and leathers fluctuate in normal times  and these fluctuations can affect us 
if  for whatever reason  the costs of our raw materials and inventory increase  we may not be able to pass those costs on to our customers 
other factors could cause either fluctuations in buying patterns or possible negative trends in the craft and western retail markets 
in addition  our customers may change their preferences to products other than ours  or they may not accept new products as we introduce them 
tax or interest rates might increase 
in particular  interest rates have been increasing 
these increases will increase our costs of borrowing funds as needed in our business 
any change in the commercial banking environment may affect us and our ability to borrow capital as needed 
other uncertainties  which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control  may occur as well 
we do not intend to update forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movement in foreign current exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material impact on our financial results 
we do not use or invest in market risk sensitive instruments to hedge any of these risks or for any other purpose 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our primary foreign currency exposure is related to our subsidiary in canada 
the leather factory of canada  ltd 
has local currency canadian dollar revenue and local currency operating expenses 
changes in the currency exchange rate impact the us dollar amount of revenue and expenses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  segment information  for financial information concerning our foreign activities 
interest rate risk we are subject to market risk associated with interest rate movements on outstanding debt 
our current credit agreement with jpmorgan chase accrues interest at a rate that changes with fluctuations in the prime rate 
because we currently have no outstanding borrowings  changes in the prime rate do not impact us in this area
