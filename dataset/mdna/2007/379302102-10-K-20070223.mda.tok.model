item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview grt is a self administered and self managed maryland real estate investment trust  or reit  which commenced business operations in january at the time of its initial public offering 
we own  lease  manage and develop a portfolio of retail properties consisting of regional and super regional malls and community shopping centers 
as of december   we owned interests in and managed properties  consisting of malls wholly owned and partially owned through a joint venture and community centers located in states 
the properties contain an aggregate of approximately million square feet of gla of which approximately was occupied at december  our primary business objective is to achieve growth in net income and funds from operations  or ffo  by developing and acquiring retail properties  by improving the operating performance and value of our existing portfolio through selective expansion and renovation of our properties  and by maintaining high occupancy rates  increasing minimum rents per square foot of gla and aggressively controlling costs 
key elements of our growth strategies and operating policies are to increase property values by aggressively marketing available gla and renewing existing leases  negotiate and sign leases which provide for regular or fixed contractual increases to minimum rents  capitalize on management s long standing relationships with national and regional retailers and extensive experience in marketing to local retailers  as well as exploit the leverage inherent in a larger portfolio of properties in order to lease available space  utilize our team oriented management approach to increase productivity and efficiency  acquire strategically located malls  hold properties for long term investment and emphasize regular maintenance  periodic renovation and capital improvements to preserve and maximize value  selectively dispose of assets we believe have achieved long term investment potential and redeploy the proceeds  control operating costs by utilizing our employees to perform management  leasing  marketing  finance  accounting  construction supervision  legal and information technology services  renovate  reconfigure or expand properties and utilize existing land available for expansion and development of outparcels to meet the needs of existing or new tenants  and utilize our development capabilities to develop quality properties at low costs 
our strategy is to be a leading reit focusing on anchored retail properties located primarily in the top metropolitan statistical areas by population 
we expect to continue investing in select development opportunities and in strategic acquisitions of mall properties that provide growth potential 
we expect to finance acquisition  redevelopment and development opportunities with cash on hand  borrowings under credit facilities  proceeds from strategic joint venture partners  asset dispositions  secured mortgage financings  the issuance of equity or debt securities  or a combination of two or more of the foregoing 
critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the board and the company s independent registered public accounting firm 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the critical accounting policies discussed in this section reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy relating to minimum rents does not require the use of significant estimates 
percentage rents  tenant reimbursements and components of other revenue associated with the margins related to outparcel sales include estimates 
percentage rents percentage rents  which are based on tenants sales as reported to the company  are recognized once the sales reported by such tenants exceed any applicable breakpoints as specified in the tenants leases 
the percentage rents are recognized based upon the measurement dates specified in the leases which indicate when the percentage rent is due 
tenant reimbursements estimates are used to record cost reimbursements from tenants for cam  real estate tax  utilities and insurance 
we recognize revenue based upon the amounts to be reimbursed from our tenants in the same period these reimbursable expenses are incurred 
differences between estimated cost reimbursements and final amounts billed are recognized in the subsequent year 
leases are not uniform in dealing with such cost reimbursements and variations exist in computations between properties and tenants 
the company analyzes the balance of its estimated accounts receivable for real estate taxes  cam and insurance for each of its properties by comparing actual reimbursements versus actual expenses 
adjustments are also made throughout the year to these receivables and the related cost reimbursement income based upon the company s best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected 
if management s estimate of the percent of recoverable expenses that can be billed to the tenants in differs from actual amounts billed in by  the amount of income recorded during would increase or decrease by million 
outparcel sales the company sells outparcels at its various properties 
the estimated cost used to calculate the margin from these sales involves a number of estimates 
the estimates made are based either upon assigning a proportionate cost  upon historical cost paid for the total parcel to the portion of the parcel that is sold  or by incorporating the sales value method 
the proportionate share of actual cost is derived through consideration of numerous factors 
these factors include items such as ease of access to the parcel  visibility from high traffic areas and other factors that may differentiate the desirability of the particular section of the parcel that is sold 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the company s estimate of the amounts of the recorded accounts receivable at the balance sheet date that will not be recovered from cash receipts in subsequent periods 
the company s policy is to record a periodic provision for doubtful accounts based on total revenues 
the company also periodically reviews specific tenant balances and determines whether an additional allowance is necessary 
in recording such a provision  the company considers a tenant s creditworthiness  ability to pay  probability of collection and consideration of the retail sector in which the tenant operates 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed periodically based upon the company s historical experience 
investment in real estate carrying value of assets the company maintains a diverse portfolio of real estate assets 
the portfolio holdings have increased as a result of both acquisitions and the development of new properties and have been reduced by selected sales of assets 
the amounts to be capitalized as a result of acquisition and developments and the periods over which the assets are depreciated or amortized are determined based on the application of accounting standards that may require estimates as to fair value and the allocation of various costs to the individual assets 
the company allocates the cost of the acquisition based upon the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
the company also estimates the fair value of intangibles related to its acquisitions 
the valuation of the fair value of the intangibles involves estimates related to market conditions  probability of lease renewals and the current market value of in place leases 
this market value is determined by considering factors such as the tenant s industry  location within the property and competition in the specific market in which the property operates 
differences in the amount attributed to the intangible assets can be significant based upon the assumptions made in calculating these estimates 
impairment evaluation management evaluates the recoverability of its investment in real estate assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of the asset is not assured 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its investments in real estate assets to be held and used each quarter and records an impairment charge when there is an indicator of impairment and the undiscounted projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount for a particular property 
the estimated cash flows used for the impairment analysis and the determination of estimated fair value are based on the company s plans for the respective assets and the company s views of market and economic conditions 
the estimates consider matters such as current and historical rental rates  occupancies for the respective properties and comparable properties and recent sales data for comparable properties 
changes in estimated future cash flows due to changes in the company s plans or views of market and economic conditions could result in recognition of impairment losses  which  under the applicable accounting guidance  could be substantial 
investment in real estate held for sale the company evaluates the held for sale classification of its owned real estate each quarter 
assets that are classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
assets are generally classified as held for sale once management commits to a plan to sell the properties and has initiated an active program to market them for sale 
the results of operations of these real estate properties are reflected as discontinued operations in all periods reported 
on occasion  the company will receive unsolicited offers from third parties to buy individual properties 
under these circumstances  the company will classify the particular property as held for sale when a sales contract is executed with no contingencies and the prospective buyer has funds at risk to ensure performance 
sale of real estate assets the sale of real estate assets may also involve the application of judgments in determining whether the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer and that a sale has been completed for purposes of recognizing a gain on the sale 
the company recognizes property sales in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
the company generally records the sales of operating properties and outparcels using the full accrual method at closing  when the earnings process is deemed to be complete 
sales not qualifying for full recognition at the time of sale are accounted for under other appropriate deferral methods 
accounting for acquisitions the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and tenant improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases for acquired in place leases  the value of tenant relationships  and the value of in place leases  based in each case on their fair values 
purchase accounting is applied to assets and liabilities related to real estate entities acquired based upon the percentage of interest acquired 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land  building and tenant improvements is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets 
management determines the as if vacant fair value of a property using methods to determine the replacement cost of the tangible assets 
in determining the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property  above market and below market in place lease values are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the capitalized above market lease values and the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an adjustment to rental income over the initial lease term 
the aggregate value of in place leases is determined by evaluating various factors  including an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods  current market conditions and similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  legal and other related costs 
the value assigned to this intangible asset is amortized over the remaining lease term plus an assumed renewal period that is reasonably assured 
the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets include tenant relationships 
factors considered by management in assigning a value to these relationships include assumptions of probability of lease renewals  investment in tenant improvements  leasing commissions and an approximate time lapse in rental income while a new tenant is located 
the value assigned to this intangible asset is amortized over the average life of the relationship 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense for real estate assets is computed using a straight line method and estimated useful lives for buildings and improvements using a weighted average composite life of forty years and equipment and fixtures of five to ten years 
expenditures for leasehold improvements and construction allowances paid to tenants are capitalized and amortized over the initial term of each lease 
cash allowances paid to retailers that are used for purposes other than improvements to the real estate are amortized as a reduction to minimum rents over the initial lease term 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
cash allowances paid in return for operating covenants from retailers who own their real estate are capitalized as contract intangibles 
these intangibles are amortized over the period the retailer is required to operate their store 
investment in unconsolidated real estate entities the company evaluates all joint venture arrangements for consolidation 
the percentage interest in the joint venture  evaluation of control and whether a variable interest entity vie exists are all considered in determining if the arrangement qualifies for consolidation 
the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated real estate entities using the equity method of accounting  whereby the cost of an investment is adjusted for the company s share of equity in net income or loss beginning on the date of acquisition and reduced by distributions received 
the income or loss of each investee is allocated in accordance with the provisions of the applicable operating agreements 
the allocation provisions in these agreements may differ from the ownership interest held by each investor 
differences between the carrying amount of the company s investment in the respective investees and the company s share of the underlying equity of such unconsolidated entities are amortized over the respective lives of the underlying assets as applicable 
the company periodically reviews its investment in unconsolidated real estate entities for other than temporary declines in market value 
any decline that is not expected to be recovered in the next twelve months is considered other than temporary and an impairment charge is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the investment 
no impairment charges were recognized during the year ended december  related to our investment in unconsolidated real estate entities 
deferred costs the company capitalizes initial direct costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  and amortizes these costs over the initial lease term 
the costs are capitalized upon the execution of the lease and the amortization period begins the earlier of the store opening date or the date the tenant s lease obligation begins 
derivatives the company has used interest rate cap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure and interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors  and all contracts are intended to be effective as hedges of specific interest rate risk exposures 
in connection with the determination of the effectiveness of these hedges and the recognition of any unrealized gain or loss on these contracts  the company computes the fair value of the contracts at each balance sheet date 
to determine the fair values of derivative instruments  the company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date 
standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  replacement cost and termination cost are used to determine fair value 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never actually be realized 
the company at times employs an external third party to perform an independent assessment of the fair value of the derivatives portfolio 
the aggregate fair value of the company s derivative instruments was nominal at december  and funds from operations our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
we have also indicated that ffo is a key measure of financial performance 
ffo is an important and widely used financial measure of operating performance in the reit industry  which we believe provides important information to investors and a relevant basis for comparison among reits 
we believe that ffo is an appropriate and valuable measure of our operating performance because real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains a residual value to a much greater extent than personal property and  accordingly  reductions for real estate depreciation and amortization charges are not meaningful in evaluating the operating results of the properties 
ffo  as defined by nareit defined fully in item is used by the real estate industry and investment community as a supplemental measure of the performance of real estate companies 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
our ffo may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other reit s 
the following table illustrates the calculation of ffo and the reconciliation of ffo to net income available to common shareholders for the years ended december   and in thousands for the years ended december  net loss income available to common shareholders add back less real estate depreciation and amortization equity in income of unconsolidated entities share of joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization minority interest in operating partnership discontinued operations gain on sales of properties funds from operations ffo comparison of year ended december  to december  ffo decreased  or million  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  during  we incurred million of impairment charges primarily related to three mall properties  two of which were listed as held for sale  as compared to million related primarily to community centers for the same period ended december  also contributing to the decrease in ffo was a million increase in overall interest expense 
this increase in interest expense can be attributed to a million defeasance charge associated with the release of a lien and security interest related to the mortgage loan on university mall and release of the company from our obligation under the loan 
the increase in interest expense is also attributable to a higher average loan balance during as compared to  primarily due to funding of acquisitions  capital improvements and the company s redevelopment program 
excluding the non cash impairment charges and defeasance costs  ffo would have been million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  offsetting these decreases to ffo was an increase of million to our pro rata share of ffo from our joint venture investment in puente hills mall puente and tulsa promenade tulsa

lastly  general and administrative costs increased by million 
this increase is related to charges associated with an employment agreement million and a severance agreement million with two of the company s former executives in and increased costs associated with corporate governance 
offsetting these decreases in ffo was lower overall interest expense of approximately million  a million greater contribution of operating income from our properties in and no redemption costs as incurred in the previous year
