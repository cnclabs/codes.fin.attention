the products power systems are incorporated into virtually all electronic products  such as computers and telecommunications equipment  to convert electric power from a primary source  for example a wall outlet or battery source  into the stable dc voltages required by electronic circuits 
because power systems are arranged in a myriad of application specific configurations  the company s basic strategy is to exploit the density and performance advantages of its technology by offering comprehensive families of economical  component level building blocks which can be used to configure a power system specific to a user s needs 
in addition to component level power converters  which serve as modular power system building blocks  the company also manufactures and sells complete configurable power systems  accessory products  and custom power solutions 
the company operates in one industry segment the development  manufacture and sale of power conversion components and systems 
the company s principal product lines include modular power converters the company currently offers seven families of component level dc dc power converters the vi  vi j  mi  mi j  maxi  mini and micro families 
designed to be mounted directly on a printed circuit board assembly and soldered in place using contemporary manufacturing processes  each family comprises a comprehensive set of products which are offered in a wide range of input voltage  output voltage and power ratings 
this allows end users to select products appropriate to their individual applications 
the product families differ in maximum power ratings  performance characteristics  package size and  in certain cases  in target market 
since  the company has introduced four input series of its high power density  component level dc dc converters in three standard packages the full size maxi  the half size mini and the quarter size micro  along with military commercial off the shelf mil cots products 
in  the volt input series was introduced  which was designed for the telecommunications market as well as for distributed power systems 
output power levels from to watts are covered by these products 
in  this was followed by two additional series a volt input for off line rectified or volt ac and distributed power applications  and a volt input specifically designed for use in power factor corrected systems 
this latter series increased the power available to watts 
in  a volt input series was added to the standard product line to address additional telecommunications  industrial and defense market opportunities 
the company has undergone a process of converting these products to the new fastrak platform that was completed in the first quarter of the conversion to fastrak has resulted in lower unit costs  improved manufacturing yields  improved field reliability and improved gross margins 
the vicor design assistance computer vdac  a core component of the vicor powerbench tool suite  was introduced for general use in and is a proprietary system  which enables vicor s customers to specify on line  and verify in real time  the performance and attributes of its maxi  mini  micro and mil cots dc dc converters

this integrated device enables live insertion of plug in cards and simultaneous emi noise suppression for dc dc converter applications 
customer specific products since its inception  the company has accepted a certain amount of custom power supply business 
in most cases  the customer was unable to obtain a conventional solution that could achieve the desired level of performance in the available space 
by utilizing its component level power products as core elements in developing most of these products  the company was able to meet the customer s needs with a reliable  high power density  total solution 
however  in keeping with the company s strategy of focusing on sales of standard families of component level power building blocks  custom product sales have not been directly pursued 
the company has traditionally pursued these custom opportunities through value added resellers vars and a

the company has been issued patents in the united states which expire between and  in europe which expire between and  and in japan which expire between and 
the company also has a number of patent applications pending in the united states  europe and the far east 
the company intends to vigorously protect its rights under its patents 
although the company believes that patents are an effective way of protecting its technology  there can be no assurances that the company s patents will prove to be enforceable see  eg  part i  item legal proceedings 
while some of the company s patents are deemed materially important to the company s operations  the company believes that no one patent is essential to the success of the company 

table of contents licensing in addition to generating revenue from product sales  licensing is an element of the company s strategy for building worldwide product and technology acceptance and market share 
in granting licenses  the company generally retains the right to use its patented technologies  and manufacture and sell its products  in all licensed geographic areas and fields of use 
licenses are granted and administered through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  vlt  inc  which owns the company s patents 
revenues from licensing arrangements have not exceeded of the company s consolidated revenues in any of the last three fiscal years 
on october   the company announced that it entered into a non exclusive license with celestica corporation to manufacture and sell the v i chip product family 
v i chips are the building blocks of the new fpa products that vicor announced in april in september  the company was notified that celestica s power systems division had been acquired by c d technologies  inc and that the license was being assigned to c d

employees as of december   the company employed approximately  full time and part time people 
the company believes that its continued success depends  in part  on its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
although there is strong demand for qualified technical personnel  the company has not to date experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient engineering and technical personnel to meet its needs see part i  item i risk factors 
none of the company s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
item a risk factors this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of  among other factors  the risk factors set forth below 
our future operating results are subject to fluctuations 
our future operating results may be materially affected by a number of factors  including the level of orders and demand from customers  the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors  the ability to achieve and or maintain yield improvements and cost reductions particularly with maxi  mini  micro and fpa products  achieving increased sales of fpa products  changes in the product mix  and changes in economic conditions in the united states and international markets 
as a result of these and other factors  we cannot assure you that we will not experience significant fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market leading edge  cost effective products 
the power supply industry and the industries in which many of our customers operate are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change  product obsolescence and price erosion for mature products  each of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we fail to continue to develop and commercialize leading edge technologies and products that are cost effective and maintain high standards of quality  our competitive position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents specifically  we may not be successful in leveraging the v i chips in standard products to promote market acceptance of factorized power 
our future operating results are dependent on the growth in our customers businesses 
we manufacture modular power components and power systems that are incorporated into our customers electronic products 
our growth is therefore dependent on the growth in the sales of our customers products as well as the development by our customers of new products 
if we fail to anticipate changes in our customers businesses and their changing product needs  our results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted 
if we were unable to use our manufacturing facility in andover  massachusetts  we would not be able to manufacture for an extended period of time 
all modular power components  whether for direct sale to customers or for sale to our subsidiaries for incorporation into their respective products  are manufactured at our andover  massachusetts production facility 
damage to this facility due to fire  natural disaster  power loss or other events could cause us to cease manufacturing 
any prolonged inability to utilize all or a significant portion of this facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may not be able to procure necessary key components for our products  or we may purchase too much inventory or the wrong inventory 
the power supply industry  and the electronics industry as a whole  can be subject to business cycles 
during periods of growth  key components required to build our products may become unavailable in the timeframe required for us to meet our customers demands 
our inability to secure sufficient components to build products for our customers could negatively impact our sales and operating results 
we may choose to mitigate this risk by increasing the levels of inventory for certain key components 
increased inventory levels can increase the potential risk for excess and obsolescence should our forecasts fail to materialize or if there are negative factors impacting our customers end markets 
if we purchase too much inventory or the wrong inventory  we may have to record additional inventory reserves or write off the inventory  which could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and on our results of operations 
our revenues may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity 
we have made significant additions to our manufacturing equipment and capacity over the past several years  including equipment for fpa products and the fastrak platform 
if overall revenue levels do not increase enough to offset the increased fixed costs  or significant revenues do not materialize for the fpa products or if there is deterioration in our business  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  asset values could be impaired if the additional capacity is underutilized for an extended period of time resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we rely on third party suppliers and subcontractors for components and assemblies and  therefore  cannot control their availability or quality 
we depend on third party suppliers and subcontractors to provide components and assemblies used in our products  some of which are sole sourced 
if suppliers or subcontractors cannot provide their products or services on time or to our specifications  we may not be able to meet the demand for our products and our delivery times may be negatively affected 
in addition  we cannot directly control the quality of the products and services provided by third parties 
in order to grow  we may need to find new or change existing suppliers and subcontractors 
this could cause disruptions in production  delays in the shipping of product or increases in prices paid to third parties 

table of contents we are exposed to economic  political and other risks through our foreign sales and distributors 
international sales have been and are expected to be a significant component of total sales 
dependence on foreign third parties for sales and distribution is subject to special risks  such as foreign economic and political instability  foreign currency controls and market fluctuations  trade barriers and tariffs  foreign regulations and exchange rates 
sudden or unexpected changes in the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our ability to successfully implement our business strategy may be limited if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel 
our success depends on our ability to retain the services of our executive officers 
the loss of one or more members of senior management could materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
in particular  we are dependent on the services of dr 
patrizio vinciarelli  our founder  chairman  president and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of dr 
vinciarelli could have a material adverse effect on our development of new products and on our results of operations 
in addition  we depend on highly skilled engineers and other personnel with technical skills that are in high demand and are difficult to replace 
our continued operations and growth depend on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel in a very competitive employment market 
if we are unable to attract and retain these employees  our ability to successfully implement our business strategy may be harmed 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights  which may limit our ability to compete effectively 
we operate in an industry in which the ability to compete depends on the development or acquisition of proprietary technologies which must be protected to preserve the exclusive use of such technologies 
we devote substantial resources to establish and protect our patents and proprietary rights  and we rely on patent and intellectual property law to protect such rights 
this protection  however  may not prevent competitors from independently developing products similar or superior to our products 
we may be unable to protect or enforce current patents  may rely on unpatented technology that competitors could restrict  or may be unable to acquire patents in the future  and this may have a material adverse affect on our competitive position 
in addition  the intellectual property laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as those of the united states 
we have been and may need to continue to defend or challenge patents 
we have incurred and expect to incur significant costs in and devote significant resources to these efforts which  if unsuccessful  may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to resolve 
we may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting that our products or manufacturing processes infringe on a third party s patent or other intellectual property rights 
in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  we could be forced to either redesign or stop production of products incorporating that technology  and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to defend us against claims of infringement  and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of key personnel 
an adverse outcome in these types of matters could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations and financial condition 
we may face legal claims and litigation that could be costly to resolve 
we may in the future encounter legal action from customers  vendors or others concerning product warranty or other claims 
we have ongoing litigation with several customers and vendors over product warranty matters  which are fully described in part i  item legal proceedings 
such litigation is costly and diverts the attention of key personnel 
an adverse outcome in these current or future matters could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations and financial condition 
in fact  on february   the company announced that it has reached an agreement in principle with ericsson  inc  to settle a lawsuit 
table of contents brought by ericsson against the company in california state court 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  reached on february  after a court ordered mediation  the company agreed to pay million to ericsson  of which million will be paid by the company s insurance carriers 
accordingly  the company recorded a net loss of million from litigation related settlement in the fourth quarter of compliance with the china rohs may not proceed as planned 
the company achieved compliance with the restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment in china  referred to as china rohs  ahead of the designated march  deadline 
compliance with phase will involve working with certain suppliers and customers and may potentially require the redesign of certain products and the modification of certain manufacturing processes 
as a result  the following situations could negatively impact our results of operations customers transition to china rohs compliant products may be unpredictable  and forecasting inaccuracy may negatively impact the availability of raw materials 
the phase deadline  for which a formal date has not been established  may be set prior to supplier and product compliance changes being made  which could interrupt product shipments targeted for export and use in china 
item b unresolved staff comments the company received written comments from the securities and exchange commission regarding its periodic or current reports under the securities exchange act of  as amended  that were received days or more before december  to which the company filed responses

item legal proceedings vicor and vlt  inc vlt  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  are pursuing reset patent infringement claims directly against artesyn technologies  lucent technologies and tyco electronics power systems  inc in the united states district court in boston  massachusetts 
the lawsuit against lucent was filed in may and in april  the company added tyco electronics as a defendant in that lawsuit 
the lawsuit against artesyn was filed in february in january  the district court issued a pre trial decision in each of these patent infringement lawsuits relating to claim construction of the reset patent 
the district court s decisions rejected assertions that the reset patent claims are invalid for indefiniteness  and affirmed vicor s interpretation of several terms used in the reset patent claims 
however  the district court adopted interpretations of certain terms of the reset patent claims that are contrary to vicor s position 
on may   the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the decisions issued in january by the district court 
vicor believes that the district court s decisions  and the affirmation of these decisions by the federal circuit  strengthens its position regarding validity of the patent  but reduces the cumulative amount of infringing power supplies and the corresponding amount of potential damages 
the federal circuit has referred the proceedings back to the district court for trials on validity of the reset patent and infringement and damages by lucent and tyco  and artesyn 
in june  artesyn and lucent and tyco 
table of contents filed motions to dismiss vlt s remanded cases against them 
on january   the court denied artesyn s motion and set a trial date for march   but granted the lucent and tyco motion in part  dismissing vlt s case 
on january   in response to the court s order of dismissal  vlt filed a new action against lucent and tyco alleging infringement of vlt s  patent 
in addition  on january   vlt filed a motion requesting the court to withdraw its order of dismissal in the lucent and tyco case 
in response to the company and artesyn informing the court that a tentative settlement has been reached between them  the court has subsequently dismissed the artesyn case  allowing either party to reopen the action within days if the tentative settlement is not consummated 
the district court has not yet set a date for the remaining trial 
there can be no assurance that vicor and vlt will ultimately prevail with respect to any of these claims or  if they prevail  as to the amount of damages that would be awarded 
in may  ericsson wireless communications  inc v 
vicor corporation was filed in superior court of the state of california  county of san diego 
the plaintiff has brought an action against the company seeking compensatory damages and lost profits with respect to post warranty contract and tort claims for products previously purchased by it from the company 
in november  the plaintiff filed a first amended complaint adding claims against exar corporation  a former vendor of the company 
the company filed cross claims against exar  and third party claims against rohm device usa  llc and rohm co  ltd  the original manufacturer s of a component that exar sold to the company  which was included in the product subsequently sold by the company to the plaintiff 
on february   the company announced that it has reached an agreement in principle with ericsson  inc  to settle a lawsuit brought by ericsson against the company in california state court 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  reached on february  after a court ordered mediation  the company agreed to pay million to ericsson  of which million will be paid by the company s insurance carriers 
the company s decision to enter into the settlement followed an adverse ruling by the court in january in connection with a settlement between ericsson and co defendants exar corporation and rohm device usa  llc  two of the company s component suppliers prior to the company strongly disagrees with the ruling  which it is appealing 
although a successful appeal would enable the company to seek recoveries from exar and rohm  there is no assurance that it will be successful in the appeal 
in light of this ruling and after taking into consideration the possibility of further recoveries from the insurance carriers  the company decided to settle the ericsson case at this time 
accordingly  the company recorded a net loss of million from litigation related settlement in the fourth quarter of on august   the company filed an action in the superior court of the commonwealth of massachusetts  county of essex the massachusetts court against concurrent computer corporation concurrent in response to a demand made by concurrent in connection with breach of contract and breach of product warranty claims against the company 
on september   concurrent filed a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association 
concurrent is seeking  in replacement costs  plus incidental  consequential and any other damages to be determined 
on march  the massachusetts court allowed concurrent s motion to compel arbitration 
vicor appealed the motion to compel arbitration decision  but on february   that motion was denied 
the arbitration panel has set the matter for discovery with a hearing date of october  the company has denied the claims made against it and intends to vigorously defend the claims made against it 
in addition  the company is involved in certain other litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of its business 
while the outcome of lawsuits and claims against the company cannot be predicted with certainty  management does not expect any current litigation or claims to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations

the following table sets forth certain items of selected consolidated financial information as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
this table and the subsequent discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes of the company contained elsewhere in this report 
year ended december  net revenues gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses income loss before income taxes critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  impairment of long lived assets  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different 
table of contents assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following accounting policies involve its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments  based on assessments of customers credit risk profiles and payment histories 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories the company employs a variety of methodologies to estimate allowances for its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory  based upon its known backlog and historical usage  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
for the company s brick products produced at the andover location  its principal manufacturing location  the model used is based upon a comparison of on hand quantities to projected demand  such that amounts on hand in excess of three year projected usage are fully reserved for inventories of those products 
since vi chip products are at a relatively early stage  a one year projected usage assumption is used 
while we have used our best efforts and believe we have used the best available information to estimate future demand  due to uncertainty in the economy and our business and the inherent difficulty in predicting future demand  it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 
other investments the accounting for other investment transactions is reviewed for compliance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method for accounting for investments in common stock apb and or fasb interpretation no 
revised fin r consolidation of variable interest entities 
the company has accounted for the investment in great wall semiconductor corporation  gws under apb as a cost method investment as management believes it does not have significant influence over gws 
the company periodically evaluates the investment in gws to determine if there are any events or circumstances that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
examples of such impairment indicators include  but are not limited to gws actual results of operations  actual results of operations compared to forecast  working capital requirements  additional third party equity investment  if any  or a significant doubt about an investee s ability to continue as a going concern 
if we identify an impairment indicator  we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare it to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value  the investment is impaired and we make a determination as to whether the impairment is other than temporary 
for other than temporary impairments  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investment s carrying value and its fair value 
impairment losses on this investment are included in other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
in the fourth quarter of  the investment was adjusted for a decline in value judged to be other than temporary of  deterioration or changes in gws business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods 
long lived assets management evaluates the recoverability of the company s identifiable intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  which generally requires that the recoverability of these assets be assessed when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
the company periodically assesses the remaining use of fixed assets based upon operating results and cash flows 
table of contents from operations 
equipment has been written down as a result of these assessments as necessary 
goodwill is tested for potential impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
stock based compensation the adoption of fas r in the first quarter of fiscal requires that stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards be recognized in the statement of income  rather than being disclosed in a pro forma footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
determining the amount of stock based compensation requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the use of this model requires us to make estimates for the following assumptions expected volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield and forfeiture rate 
changes in any of these assumptions may have an impact on the amount of stock based compensation recorded 
product warranties the company generally warrants its products for a period of two years 
vicor maintains allowances for estimated product returns under warranty based upon a review of known or potential product failures in the field and upon historical patterns of product returns 
if unforeseen product issues arise or product returns increase above expected rates  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company has assessed the need for a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance for a portion of the deferred tax assets is warranted at december  in reaching this conclusion  the company evaluated all relevant criteria including the existence of significant temporary differences reversing in the carryforward period  primarily depreciation 
the valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets may require adjustment in the future based on changes in the mix of temporary differences  changes in tax laws  and operating performance 
in addition  the assessment of the valuation allowance requires the company to make estimates of future taxable income and to estimate reversals of temporary differences 
changes in the assumptions or other circumstances may require additional valuation allowances if actual reversals of temporary differences differ from those estimates 
the company operates in numerous taxing jurisdictions and is  therefore  subject to a variety of income and related taxes 
the company has provided for potential tax liabilities due in various jurisdictions which it judges to be probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies 
judgment is required in determining the income tax expense and related tax liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
the company believes it has reasonably estimated its accrued taxes for all jurisdictions for all open tax periods 
the company periodically assesses the adequacy of its tax and related accruals on a quarterly basis and adjusts appropriately as events warrant and open tax periods close 
it is possible that the final tax outcome of these matters will be different from management s estimate reflected in the income tax provisions and accrued taxes 
such differences could have a material impact on the company s income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
contingencies from time to time  we receive notices for product failure claims or that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others or for other matters 
we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in accordance with 
table of contents statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies fas 
in making this assessment  we may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information we obtain  combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter  we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable  we record a loss in accordance with fas in determining the amount of the loss  we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  if any  prior case history and other factors 
should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect  we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position

item a qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on its cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as the company s cash and cash equivalents consist principally of money market securities  which are short term in nature  the company s exposure to market risk on interest rate fluctuations for these investments is not significant 
the company s short term and long term investments consist mainly of corporate debt securities 
these debt securities are all highly rated investments  in which a significant portion have interest rates reset at auction at regular intervals 
as a result  the company believes there is minimal market risk to these investments 
our annual interest income would change by approximately  in for each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
the company s exposure to market risk for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the operations of vjcl and changes in the dollar yen exchange rate 
relative to foreign currency exposure against the yen existing at december   a unfavorable movement in the dollar yen exchange rate would increase the foreign currency loss by approximately  in addition  the functional currency of the company s subsidiaries in europe and hong kong is the us dollar 
therefore  the company believes that market risk is mitigated since these operations are not exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations
