item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of many factors including those under the caption forward looking information in item overview our strategy for returning to growth and profitability is by continuing to gain market share in the custom folding cartons business and aggressively entering the commercial print market by serving the largest print distributors and internet print providers  while capturing direct customers in select markets 
we believe the commercial print industry will continue consolidating and  given our operational expertise to serve a large number of smaller orders with rapid production on a profitable basis  we can quickly gain market share 
we believe we can effectively challenge other printer businesses because we offer faster speed  higher variability and flexibility  more value added services such as web based print and can capitalize on our facility s economies of scale to offer competitive prices with better margins than those printers whose business models are based on long lead times and large production runs or those lacking the depth in capabilities and sufficient scale to profitably serve such a diverse marketplace 
during the period of through reviewed in the following discussion  our operations have been significantly influenced by the activities associated with our former supply agreements with vistaprint limited

commercial print on demand product line sales were down million  or  to million in from million in during the first eight months of  mod pac s contract with vistaprint was based on a long term cost recovery approach with the terms of the agreement stretching until april vistaprint was billed for the costs in our plant that were dedicated to their production requirements plus a one third mark up on product fulfillment 
on september   this arrangement was revised to a more traditional customer vendor supply arrangement with the definitive term of the agreement changed to one year  through august  the pricing structure was changed as well to a units based approach 
as a part of the restructuring of the agreement  mod pac received payment of million from vistaprint as a buy out fee for the remaining years of the original contract 
this fee was to be amortized over a month period  which was defined by the month definitive term of the new agreement that was effective september  and the month period for which a pricing framework was described in this agreement relative to any subsequent agreements 
on april   mod pac agreed to an amendment of the supply agreement that was effective september   which modified the exclusivity provision regarding the north american market

in exchange  mod pac received payments that approximated mod pac s fixed costs and mark up on such costs for the actual products vistaprint shipped

simultaneously  the company executed a supply agreement with vistaprint for the month period ending august  this agreement established unit pricing for volumes above  per month  while for volumes below that threshold  a low volume surcharge was put into place 
vistaprint  however  was not obligated to purchase printed products from mod pac under this agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  given the conclusion that the company did not anticipate any future sales to vistaprint  the remaining million of the unamortized portion of the contract buy out fee was recognized as revenue 
net sales in mod pac s stock box product line remained flat year over year at million  while the personalized print product line realized a slight increase of million in net sales to million in  from million in cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue  the cost of products sold were   and for the years   and  respectively

this aggressive ramp up of capacity through the beginning of was undertaken both to successfully service the rapidly growing vistaprint business and to address our strategic effort to aggressively enter the commercial print market 
during the latter half of and throughout  capacity was underutilized and pressure was placed on our cost of products sold 
changing sales mix also contributed to the increase in costs

 accounting for income taxes

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
in developing such estimates  management evaluates the facts known to it at the time and applies such facts within the framework of certain critical accounting policies that govern valuation allowances of the company s assets 
these policies include determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to doubtful accounts receivable  lower of cost or market reserves related to the company s inventories  depreciation allowances  impairment reserves with respect to the company s long lived assets and valuation allowances with respect to the realizability of deferred tax assets 
often  management must make certain assumptions about the future when applying these policies 
management uses past experience in developing such assumptions about the future 
actual experience will be different than the assumptions made and the differences could result in material adjustments to management s estimates 
specifically and with respect to deferred tax assets  the company had gross deferred assets at december  of million related to new york state tax credits 
these credits are subject to certain statutory provisions  such as length of available carry forward period and minimum tax  which reduces the probability of realization of the full value of such credits 
management estimates the amount of credits the company is likely to realize in the future based on actual historical realization rates and the statutory carry forward period 
as a result of the analysis performed as of december   management adjusted the valuation allowance for these credits to million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of short cycle times  the company does not have any long term commitments to purchase production raw materials or sell products that would present significant risks due to price fluctuations 
raw paper stock is available to us from multiple domestic sources and  as a result  we believe the risk of supply interruptions due to such things as strikes at the source of supply or to logistics systems are limited 
risks due to fluctuation in interest rates are not material to the company at december   because we have no exposure to floating rate debt and limited market risk on our million of temporary investments because interest is reset to market rates up to every days 
since may of  over of the company s power needs are met through natural gas 
the company has investigated supply contracts of various lengths and currently it has supply arrangements for fixed prices on approximately of its estimated usage through april  and approximately of its estimated usage from may through september historically  the price of natural gas has fluctuated widely 
although the company is concerned about cost  its main concern is availability 
the company monitors the availability of natural gas  considering such factors as amount in storage  gas production data and transportation data  so that it can take appropriate action if concerns about availability occur 
the company has investigated and tested a back up power 
table of contents source in the form of a rented transportable diesel powered generator 
although such generators are generally available  the company cannot be assured that a generator adequate to meet the company s needs would be available if and when such need should arise 
we have no foreign operations  nor do we transact any business in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we have no foreign currency market risks 
the market risk that the company was exposed to at december  was generally the same as described above  except that the company did not have supply agreements for fixed prices on any of its estimated natural gas usage
