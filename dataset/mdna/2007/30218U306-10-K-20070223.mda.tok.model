g intangible assets reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets represents primarily the amount that arose from continental s emergence from bankruptcy reorganization in effective january   we adopted and began to account for this asset in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires testing of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment rather than amortizing them 
we evaluate the carrying value of this asset each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
we perform an impairment review on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
our review includes the acquisition  market multiple and income approaches to valuation 
if this review indicates that our reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets will not be recoverable  the carrying value is reduced to the fair value 
we performed this review during  and and determined that we did not have any impairment of our reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets 
our annual impairment test is performed as of june of each year 
in finalizing the business model for the aircraft being released from the continental cpa  we determined a triggering event had occurred during the fourth quarter of in accordance with our policy  we performed an sfas impairment analysis as soon as reasonably possible after the triggering event  using the latest data available 
no impairment was identified 
airport operating rights  the rights to use certain take off and landing slots and gates  are amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the related airport facility lease  which approximates years  with no residual value 
debt issuance cost and capitalized costs related to our senior convertible notes is amortized on a straight line basis over years  the term of the notes  and with no residual value 
h investments in other entities investments in unconsolidated companies are accounted for by the equity method of accounting when we have significant influence over the operation of the companies as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock abp 
the following table details our current non controlling interests that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting company carrying amount of investment at december  in millions jetx aviation limited wing holdings  llc flight services and systems  inc in march  we purchased an interest  constituting one share less than  in jetx aviation limited  also known as expressjet europe  for approximately million 
the carrying amount of our investment exceeded the amount of the company s underlying equity by approximately million at the date of the investment 
this difference was treated as goodwill and thus was not amortized 
on june   we loaned the company approximately million to extend the level of support  which was contemplated by the governing agreements and original business plan  through its development stage 
we recorded this receivable accordingly in other assets  net 
during the third quarter of  after exhaustive discussions with numerous european air carriers and the company s failure to successfully negotiate a transaction  we determined that a decline in our investment was other than temporary  and recorded an impairment loss of million for the investment and related goodwill 
additionally  the outstanding loan balance was fully reserved during the third quarter resulting in a loss of million recorded in other operating expenses 

table of contents we purchased a interest in wing holdings  llc for million in june the carrying amount of our investment exceeded the amount of the company s underlying equity by approximately million at the time of our investment 
we evaluated the net book value of the company s fixed assets as of june  and identified approximately a million difference between net book value and fair value 
the majority of the difference is being amortized over the remaining average life of the assets identified 
as of december   the balance of the fair value difference  net of amortization  was approximately million 
the remaining million of our difference in the underlying investment is considered goodwill and thus is not amortized 
in january  we purchased a interest in flight services and systems  inc for million 
at the same time  we loaned the company million which is classified in other assets  net  on the consolidated balance sheets 
the note is due and payable in full on september  with interest due and payable quarterly on the th day following the close of each calendar quarter 
the loan interest rate is equal to the lesser of per annum or the three month libor plus basis points 
we have received interest payments pursuant to the terms of the agreement including the fourth quarter interest payment that was due january  our proportionate shares of the results of operations from these entities are included in the line equity investment income loss  net on our consolidated statements of operations 
although no impairment losses on the investments  other than jetx aviation  have been recognized  an impairment loss will be recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary 
in evaluating other than temporary  we consider the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment has been less than the carrying amount of the equity investment  the near and longer term operating and financial prospects of the entity and our longer term intent of retaining the investment in the entity 
i deferred credits our spare part and flight training credits are primarily derived from our purchase agreement with embraer 
all spare part credits are used to offset the purchase price of initial spare parts provisioning for our newly delivered aircraft 
similarly  the flight training credits are used to pay for the initial simulator rent costs for our pilots 
these credits are recorded in long term liabilities  with an offsetting entry to prepayments and other current assets or current accrued liabilities if we used more credits than the amount we are entitled to at year end 
the deferred credits are amortized as a reduction to our aircraft rent expense over the life of the associated aircraft lease 
amortization totaled million for each and the prepayments and other current assets or current accrued liabilities are reduced as the credits are used or as the remaining firm order aircraft are delivered 
j operating revenue we recognized our operating revenue under the continental cpa based on negotiated rates for each scheduled block hour airlines flies for continental 
the rates were designed to provide airlines with a target operating margin of before taking into account variations in some costs and expenses that are generally controllable by airlines 
we also record other revenues earned under the continental cpa  such as percentage of completed flights  certain on time departures and baggage handling 
see note for details of the block hour rates and the performance incentive payments 
our operating revenue is reconciled and settled with continental on a monthly basis  except for the quarterly reconciliation of airlines costs within the margin band as defined in the continental cpa 
the rates we use to calculate our operating revenue are based on our interpretation of the agreement 
if our interpretation materially differs from continental s  our revenue could be materially understated or overstated 
all fully reconciled costs incurred in connection with the continental cpa are recorded as expense and revenue on a gross basis except for certain costs such as fuel costs above our fuel and related tax cap and facility rent at continental s hubs 
these costs are absorbed by continental under the terms of the continental cpa and as such we are not the primary obligor for these costs and accordingly  these costs are not recorded as either revenue or expense by us 

table of contents k wages  salaries and related expenses as our collective bargaining agreements become amendable  we accrue for anticipated retroactive pay that we estimate will be due under the new contract

m income taxes deferred income taxes  which are provided under the liability method  are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws 
a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that future tax benefits will not be realized 
n earnings per share we account for earnings per share in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
earnings per share 
basic earnings per common share basic eps excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other obligations to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the company

the weighted average common shares outstanding for the diluted eps calculation also includes the incremental effect of shares that would be issued upon the assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock 
we excluded the following common stock equivalents from our diluted eps calculations  because their inclusion would have been anti dilutive options to purchase million  million and million shares of our common stock for the years ended december   and  respectively these options exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares for the respective periods  and million shares of restricted stock for the year ended december  and o comprehensive income we provide medical bridge coverage for employees between the ages of to  with at least years of service who have retired from the company

q recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements 
fin requires the impact of a tax position to be recognized in the financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained by the taxing authority 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the requirements of fin  however  we do not believe that it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
r reclassifications certain reclassifications have been made in prior years financial statements to conform to the current year presentation

note capacity purchase agreement with continental general 
we currently derive substantially all of our revenue from the continental cpa 
under this agreement  airlines operates flights on behalf of continental as continental express 
continental controls and is responsible for scheduling  pricing and managing seat inventories and is entitled to all revenue associated with the operation of the aircraft 
we also have various other agreements with continental that govern our relationship 
under the continental cpa  some marketing related costs normally associated with operating an airline are borne by continental 
these costs include reservations and sales  commissions  advertising  revenue accounting  fare and tariff filings  and food and beverage service 
on december   continental gave us notice of its intention to withdraw aircraft from the agreement beginning in december and ending in june we subsequently decided to retain all aircraft 
as of february   we have transitioned aircraft from continental 
compensation and operational responsibilities 
under the agreement  airlines is entitled to payment for each block hour that continental schedules it to fly 
payment is based on a formula designed to provide airlines with a target operating margin of before taking into account variations in certain costs and expenses that are generally within our control 
in accordance with the agreement  the original cost components used in this formula remained in place until december   after which new rates are to be established annually with the same methodology 
we have exposure for most labor costs and some maintenance and general administrative expenses  if the actual costs are higher than those reflected in our block hour rates 

table of contents beginning in the fall of  we negotiated with continental to adjust the scheduled block hour rates annually as required under the capacity purchase agreement 
the agreement calls for rates to be set by november of each year 
see the detailed discussion of the rate setting process below 
rate negotiation and amendment 
as part of the rate negotiation  we agreed to cap airlines prevailing margin at 
airlines also included previously unreconciled costs within the margin band  although it is not reimbursed if these costs are higher and cause its prevailing margin to fall below the margin floor 
in addition  airlines is still entitled to receive incentive payments from continental if its rate of controllable cancellations is lower than its historical benchmark  but is not required to pay continental a penalty for controllable cancellations unless the rate rises above 
airlines continued to receive a small per passenger fee and incentive payments for certain on time departure and baggage handling performance 
during  airlines quarterly reconciliation payments to continental totaled million  based on the terms of this agreement 
the table below describes how variations between airlines actual costs and estimated costs  as determined in the block hour rates  have been treated under the capacity purchase agreement since january  fully reconciled costs reconciliation payment  including margin  to the full extent actual costs differ from estimated costs

if the prevailing margin were less than due to the impact of certain costs  as described below  or if the prevailing margin were above due to other items  no reconciliation payments would be made from either continental or airlines 
maintenance  materials and repairs not included above passenger services other rental expenses other operating expenses under the fuel purchase agreement with continental  fuel and fuel tax expense are reconciled to the lower of the actual costs or the agreed upon caps of cents per gallon and cents per gallon  respectively  based on airlines fuel purchase agreement with continental 
if the fuel purchase agreement with continental were not in place  the fuel cost  including related taxes  would have been per gallon for the year ended december  depreciation is reconciled for assets and capital projects accounted for in the capacity purchase agreement or those approved by continental outside of the capacity purchase agreement 
the prevailing margin used to calculate the reconciliation payment does not take into account performance incentive payments  including payments from controllable cancellation performance  litigation costs above a historical benchmark and other costs that are not included in the block hour rates or covered by adjustments to them or are not reasonable and customary in the industry 

table of contents in  the fully reconciled costs and costs within the margin band under the capacity purchase agreement represented approximately and of total operating costs  respectively 
certain costs that were unreconciled under the capacity purchase agreement prior to now require airlines to make a reconciliation payment to continental if the differences cause the prevailing margin to be greater than 
however  if the differences cause the prevailing margin to be less than  they remain unreconciled 
these costs are wages and salaries  and benefits not included in the table above 
rate setting 
pursuant to the terms of our current capacity purchase agreement with continental  the scheduled block hour rates were finalized in april to be consistent with the rates 
rate setting 
we began rate discussions with continental last september 
although the capacity purchase agreement contemplates a november deadline for setting the rates  the parties agreed to extend the deadline 
however  in january  expressjet and continental submitted their disagreements regarding rates to binding arbitration in accordance with the terms of the capacity purchase agreement 
in the arbitration  each party has selected one arbitrator  and those two arbitrators will select the third arbitrator to complete the panel 
the continental cpa sets forth procedures and a schedule that will likely result in a hearing and the issuance of a final decision by late in the second or early in the third quarter of expressjet will continue to be paid under the block hour rates during the arbitration process and expects the decision setting the revised rates to be retroactive to january  capacity and fleet matters 
subject to the aircraft withdrawal that began in december  the capacity purchase agreement covered all of airlines aircraft for most of by june   aircraft will remain covered under our agreement with continental 
the capacity purchase agreement also allowed us to be continental s exclusive regional jet service provider at newark s liberty international  houston s bush intercontinental and cleveland s hopkins international airports through december  the continental cpa also provides that continental has the right to withdraw a limited number of our regional jets covered by the agreement under certain circumstances upon months notice 
on december   continental gave us a withdrawal notice with respect to aircraft  the maximum number that it could withdraw at that time 
under the terms of the agreement  continental cannot withdraw additional aircraft until december  unless the agreement is terminated early  which continental can do at any time upon twelve months notice 
the continental cpa has a provision for the interest rate implicit in calculating the scheduled lease payments we make to continental to increase by basis points  which was triggered when we chose to retain the aircraft released from the agreement 
see item business capacity purchase and other agreements with continental airlines aircraft financing 
we have options for erj xr aircraft that may be exercised for other types of aircraft within the erj family 
during  continental declined the right to exercise any of these options 
we retain the right to exercise them and fly these aircraft for other airlines or under our own code  subject to some restrictions  however  we will have to finance our acquisition of these aircraft independently 
so long as scheduled flights under the capacity purchase agreement with continental represent either at least of all our scheduled flights or at least of our aircraft are covered by the capacity purchase agreement  we are required to allocate our crews  maintenance personnel  facilities and other resources on a priority basis to scheduled flights under the capacity purchase agreement above all of our other flights and aircraft 

table of contents term of agreement 
the capacity purchase agreement is scheduled to expire on december  continental has the option to extend the term of the agreement with months notice for up to four additional five year terms through december  continental may terminate the agreement at any time upon months notice  or at any time without notice for cause  which is defined as our bankruptcy  suspension or revocation of our authority to operate as a scheduled airline  cessation of our operations as a scheduled airline  other than as a result of a union authorized labor strike or any temporary cessation not to exceed days  a union authorized labor strike that continues for days  or our intentional or willful material breach that substantially deprives continental of the benefits of the agreement  which is not cured within days of notice of the breach 
continental may also terminate the agreement at any time upon our material breach that does not constitute cause and continues for days after we receive notice of the breach 
if we materially breach the agreement including for cause and  for breaches other than cause  fail to cure the breach within days after we receive notice of the breach  we will have to pay continental an amount equal to the expected margin contained in the block hour rates for scheduled flights from the th day or immediately  without receipt of any notice  if the breach is for cause until the breach is cured 
in addition  continental may terminate the agreement immediately without notice or giving us an opportunity to cure if it makes a reasonable and good faith determination  using recognized standards of safety  that there is a material safety concern with our operation of any flight under the capacity purchase agreement 
if continental materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure the breach within days after we notify it of the breach  we will be entitled to obtain our payments directly from airline clearing house  inc from the th day for the duration of the default 
in addition  continental and we are each entitled to seek damages and equitable remedies in arbitration 
as discussed above  continental has reduced the level of its commitment for our aircraft under the capacity purchase agreement  which could materially reduce our revenue and earnings 
furthermore  continental leases from third parties a substantial portion of the aircraft and airport facilities that it subleases to us 
if continental declared bankruptcy or otherwise defaulted under these leases  we would have no rights to these aircraft or facilities 
our access to our aircraft and airport facilities would depend on negotiations between the lessors and us 
most favored nations 
so long as continental is our largest customer  if we enter into a capacity purchase or economically similar agreement with another major airline defined as any airline with annual revenues greater than million  prior to adjustment for inflation since to provide regional airline service for more than aircraft on terms and conditions that are  in the aggregate  less favorable to us than those in the continental cpa  the agreement has a provision that may allow continental to amend its agreement with us to conform to the terms and conditions of our new agreement

our taxable income was not adjusted  but the amount of net operating losses allocated to us was increased by approximately million 
in accordance with our tax agreement with continental  we paid continental approximately million for the increase of our federal net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  we adjusted our tax accounts for the increase in our federal net operating loss which was fully utilized in our tax year 
in conjunction with our initial public offering in april  the tax basis of our tangible and intangible assets was adjusted to fair value 
this adjustment to tax basis should result in additional tax deductions being available to us through in accordance with our tax agreement with continental  to the extent we generate taxable income sufficient to realize the additional tax deductions  we are required to pay continental a percentage of the amount of tax savings actually realized  excluding the effect of any loss carrybacks 
we are required to pay continental of the first third of the anticipated tax benefit  of the second third and of the last third 
however  if the tax benefits are not realized by the end of  we will be obligated to pay continental of any benefit realized after that date 
since these payments are solely dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets  they are recorded as an obligation to continental within the deferred tax asset accounts  and the portion we may retain in the future is offset by a valuation allowance 
at the time of the initial public offering  the valuation allowance and the obligation to continental offset the step up in basis of assets in our long term deferred tax asset account 
we made approximately million and million of net payments to continental under the tax agreement related to the additional tax deductions during and  respectively 
the tax agreement requires continental to reimburse us for any net increase in our cash tax payments resulting from any decreased availability of net operating loss carryovers related to the basis increase at the time our payment occurs 
the resulting receivable and or payable is recorded within the deferred tax asset account since its performance is dependent on our ability to generate taxable income 
no valuation allowance was established on our net operating loss carryforwards or on our receivable from continental for reimbursing carryforward losses utilized resulting from the basis increase because we believe our stand alone taxable income will be sufficient to utilize substantially all of these assets within the next several years 

table of contents we believe that our initial public offering created a change in ownership limitation on the utilization of our federal tax attribute carryforwards  primarily net operating losses 
section of the internal revenue code limits our utilization of these attributes to offset up to approximately million of post change taxable income per year 
this limitation did not have any impact on our financial condition during the years ending and our tax agreement increases our dependence on continental s financial condition 
if it is determined that any of the tax benefits related to the basis increase should not have been available at the time of utilization and  as a result  we are required to pay additional taxes  interest and penalties  then we could be adversely affected if continental were unable to indemnify us under the agreement 
note preferred  common and treasury stock preferred stock 
we have million shares of authorized preferred stock  par value

one share of preferred stock was issued and outstanding at december  after continental s ownership of common shares fell below on april   we redeemed the sole share of our special voting preferred stock held by continental 
the redemption terminated continental s right to elect a director to our board of directors

our board is divided into three classes  and our directors are elected by stockholders for three year terms 
two of the classes are comprised of three directors and the third is comprised of two

treasury stock 
in july  our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock 
purchases have been made from time to time in the open market  the timing of any share repurchases under the program depends on a variety of factors  including market conditions  and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
common stock acquired through the program will be available for general corporate purposes 
in  we purchased  shares of our common stock at an average cost per share of 
we did not make any purchases under this program during in addition  under the incentive plan  our board of directors can approve the issuance of restricted stock to various employees and non employee directors 
forfeitures of awarded shares resulted in common stock held in treasury from which subsequent restricted stock awards can be issued and stock option exercises can be satisfied 
note stock based compensation plans we have two stock based compensation plans the expressjet holdings  inc stock incentive plan the incentive plan and the expressjet holdings  inc employee stock purchase plan the espp 
the incentive plan provides that we may grant awards in the form of stock options or restricted stock to our non employee directors  our employees or employees of our subsidiaries 
the aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be issued under the incentive plan may not exceed million shares  subject to adjustments as provided in the incentive plan 
we have reserved million shares of our common stock for issuance under this plan 
options granted under the incentive plan have been awarded with exercise prices equaling the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant  vest over a four year period for employees or a six month period for non employee directors and expire seven years after the date of grant in the case of employees and ten years after the date of grant in the case of directors 

table of contents prior to  we accounted for our stock based compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
under apb  if the exercise price of our stock options equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense was recognized 
since our stock options have all been granted with exercise prices that equal fair market value on the grant date  no compensation expense was recognized under apb we also recognized compensation expense for our restricted stock in accordance with apb the total compensation expense incurred for each restricted stock grant equaled the product of the number of shares issued and the closing price of our common stock on the issuance date  the expense was recognized over the vesting period of each grant in accordance with the method specified in financial accounting standards board interpretation no accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans fin 
under apb  we did not recognize compensation expense related to the espp 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board statement no 
r  share based payments statement r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized during the twelve months ended december  includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not vested at january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of statement  and b compensation cost for share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of statement r 
results for prior periods have not been restated  which is consistent with the transition method selected 
the fair value of holdings options granted during was estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires us to make several assumptions 
the table below summarizes the weighted average of these assumptions for the year ended december  risk free interest rate dividend yield expected market price volatility of our common stock expected life of options years the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect for the expected term of the option at the time of grant 
the dividend yield on our common stock is assumed to be zero since we do not pay dividends and have no current plans to pay future dividends 
the market price volatility of our common stock was based on historical volatility since april   the date of our initial public offering 
our methodology is consistent with prior period volatility assumptions 
the expected life of the options is based upon our anticipated expectations of exercise behavior since no options have been exercised since our initial public offering to provide relevant historical data 
based upon the assumptions above  the weighted average fair value of the options granted during was determined to be

on may   our stockholders approved the espp  which authorized the sale of up to one million shares of our common stock 
we have reserved one million shares of our common stock for issuance under the espp 
under the plan  all of our employees are eligible to purchase shares of our common stock at of the lower of the fair market value on the first or last day of the semi annual purchase period

table of contents as a result of adopting statement r on january   our income before income taxes and net income for the year ended december   was approximately million and million lower  respectively  than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  decreased by approximately lower  respectively  than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under opinion prior to the adoption of statement r  we presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the statement of cash flows 
statement r requires the cash flows resulting from tax benefits from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
during the twelve months ended december   no stock options were exercised thus having no effect on the cash flow statement 
the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share assuming the compensation cost for our stock option  restricted stock and employee stock purchase plans were determined using the fair value method  prorated over the vesting periods in accordance with fin  at the grant dates as required under sfas r for the years ended december  and in thousands  except for per share data net income as reported add total stock based compensation expense included in reported net income  net of taxes deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value pro forma basic earnings per share as reported pro forma diluted earnings per share as reported pro forma on november   our board of directors approved accelerating the vesting of  unvested options currently held by employees  including executive officers  with exercise prices greater than per share and extended the term of  employee options that had a five year term to seven years 
these options were and remain out of the money  and the acceleration and extension were effective immediately 
no options held by non employee directors were subject to acceleration or extension 
the acceleration of vesting reduces compensation expense upon the adoption of sfas r

table of contents note employee benefit plans effective december   the expressjet airlines  inc k savings plan k plan was adopted 
substantially all our domestic employees are covered by this plan 
under the plan  we offered the following benefits a retirement match up to of pay per person which vests over five years  and a service based match which vested immediately  depending on years of service and the terms of the collective bargaining agreements  as applicable 
effective october  for airlines mechanics  who are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters  and january  for all other employees  the k plan was amended 
under the amended plan  we offer the following benefits a service based retirement match from up to of pay per person which vests over five years depending on years of service  and a service based retirement contribution with year cliff vesting depending on years of service and the terms of the collective bargaining agreements  as applicable

the expressjet airlines  inc profit sharing plan the profit sharing plan was adopted effective january  and amended on february  under this plan  if airlines achieves a operating margin  the profit sharing plan will pay out of eligible base pay received during the year to our eligible employees  which excludes employees whose collective bargaining agreements provide otherwise and employees who participate in our management bonus program or any other bonus program designated by the human resources committee of our board 
profit sharing expense for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
we also provide medical bridge coverage for employees between the ages of to  with at least years of service who have retired from the company 
on december  we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of statement statement required the recognition of fund status ie  the difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligations of its pension plan in the december  statement of financial position  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income at adoption represents the new unrecognized actuarial gain and unrecognized prior service costs 
the incremental effects of adopting the provisions of statement on the statement of financial position at december  is an increase to accumulated other comprehensive income and a decrease to accrued payroll and related cost of million million  net of tax 
the adoption of statement had no effect on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december   or for any prior periods presented  and it will not affect the operating results in future periods 
note commitments and contingencies capacity purchase agreement 
so long as continental is our largest customer  if we enter into a capacity purchase or economically similar agreement with another major airline defined as any airline with annual revenues greater than million  prior to adjustment for inflation since to provide regional airline service for more than aircraft on terms and conditions that are  in the aggregate  less favorable to us than those in the capacity purchase agreement  the capacity purchase agreement has a provision that may allow continental to amend its agreement with us to conform to the terms and conditions of our new agreement 

table of contents in addition  there are provisions in the capacity purchase agreement that require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer  subject to applicable laws  to continental or its designee any of our airport take off or landing slots  route authorities or other regulatory authorizations used for airlines scheduled flights under the agreement 
continental is generally responsible for all capital and start up costs for airport terminal facilities at its hub airports and at any other facilities where it elects to provide baggage handling services to us 
if continental elects to provide baggage handling services at any facility where we previously provided baggage handling services  continental will reimburse us for most of the capital and start up costs we incurred at that facility 
we are generally responsible for any capital and start up costs associated with any airport terminal facilities at other airports where we fly and any non terminal facilities not regularly used by continental 
if we exit a market at the direction of continental and we do not re enter that market under our own code or that of an airline other than continental within six months  continental will reimburse us for certain losses incurred in connection with the closure of the related facility 
if the capacity purchase agreement is terminated  we may be required to vacate the terminal facilities or all facilities if the termination results from our material breach of the agreement that are subleased to us by continental  and to use commercially reasonable efforts to assign to continental or designee any lease in our name for these facilities 
in september  airlines began discussions with continental to adjust the scheduled block hour rates for under the continental cpa 
although the agreement contemplates a november deadline for setting the rates each year  the parties extended that deadline in an attempt to reach agreement 
in january  the parties submitted their disagreements to binding arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement  which provides that it will be conducted pursuant to the federal arbitration act 
each party has selected one arbitrator  and those two will select a third arbitrator to complete the panel 
the agreement sets forth procedures and a schedule that will likely result in a hearing and issuance of a final decision by late in the second or early in the third quarter of airlines will continue to be paid under the block hour rates during the arbitration process and expects the decision setting the revised rates to be retroactive to january  we do not intend to issue any reports on the progress of the arbitration until the panel issues its final decision 
we cannot predict the outcome of the arbitration 
if decided adversely to us  the arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial position

risk factors 
purchase commitments 
as of december   we had options for erj xr aircraft that may be exercised for other types of aircraft within the erj family 
during  continental declined the right to exercise any of these options 
we retain the right to exercise them and fly these aircraft for other airlines or under our own code  subject to some restrictions  however  we will have to finance our acquisition of these aircraft independently 
currently  we do not have any firm commitments for aircraft purchases 
prior to december  under our power by the hour agreement with rolls royce  we were obligated to acquire up to three spare engines to support our existing aircraft and the remaining eight aircraft on firm order 
in december  we negotiated the sale of eight engines to rolls royce and  in exchange  entered into seven new engine leases with a rolls royce subsidiary 
the engines leased have greater interchangeability than the engines sold 
as a result  we have satisfied our engine obligations and are no longer obligated to purchase the three engines 
these leases are classified as operating leases  hence they are not reflected as assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we also have other contractual obligations of approximately billion under our power by the hour contracts with various service providers 
the power by the hour contracts dictate the method by which we pay a vendor based on our actual level of operations in exchange for vendor coverage on specific parts and equipment on our aircraft when those parts and equipment are in need of repair or replacement 
each contract varies in term and payment procedure 
the estimated amount of our future commitment is based on assumptions related to future level of operations and forecasted payment rates 
our level of operations is determined by continental  which has exclusive scheduling authority over our fleet under the capacity purchase agreement 
the level of operations inherent in the estimate is based on continental s most recent operating plan for us  which can be altered at continental s sole discretion and included operations for the aircraft exiting the continental cpa 
forecasted payment rates are based on actual rates as of december  and increased annually according to the particular inflation indices detailed in each contract 
contractual rate increases at actual time of occurrence may be different than the forecasted rates 

table of contents see a summary of all our contractual obligations in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital commitments contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
general guarantees and indemnifications 
pursuant to the capacity purchase agreement  we indemnify continental for certain of our actions and it indemnifies us for some of its actions 
during  we incurred million in other operating expenses relating to a claim by continental for costs incurred during the post retirement storage of certain turboprop aircraft engines 
additionally  we are party to many contracts  in which it is common for us to agree to indemnify third parties for tort liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the contract 
in some cases  this indemnity extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties  but typically excludes liabilities caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct 
we cannot estimate the potential amount of future payments under these indemnities until events arise that would trigger a liability under the indemnities 
however  we expect to be covered by insurance for a material portion of these liabilities  subject to deductibles  policy terms and condition 
employees 
as of december   approximately of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
our contracts with our pilots  dispatchers  flight attendants  and mechanics will be amendable in december  july  august and august  respectively 
our other employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
legal proceedings 
we are a defendant in various lawsuits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business 
while the outcome of these lawsuits and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows  we do not believe that the ultimate disposition of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
note related party transactions the following is a summary of significant related party transactions that occurred during the three years ended december   other than those discussed elsewhere in the notes to consolidated financial statements

table of contents during  we amended our administrative support and information services provisioning agreement with continental  which primarily extended the agreement for the term of the agreement 
we also amended the agreement to incorporate the amendment to our power by the hour agreement with rolls royce that was signed in september under our amended master facility and ground handling agreement with continental  rent expenses are allocated to us at the airport locations where airlines operates 
additionally  all terminal facility rents at the hub airports are now borne by continental and airlines pays for incremental rent at other continental managed locations unless continental does not operate any aircraft there 
in these situations  airlines is responsible for the rent expense 
at locations airlines manages  rent is allocated between continental and airlines based on the number of respective passengers 
in december  we recorded a current receivable from continental in the amount of million related to the reimbursement of the life limited parts used on seven of the eight engines sold to rolls royce 
this receivable is included in amounts due from continental airlines  inc  net on the face of the balance sheet

upon reconciling the tax impact of the spin off in our deferred tax accounts  a deferred tax asset of approximately million remained 
at the end of  this asset was included in our deferred tax accounts 
in  based on continental s agreement with our reconciliation and the conclusion that this asset was related to our spin off from continental  the item was reclassified as a receivable from continental
