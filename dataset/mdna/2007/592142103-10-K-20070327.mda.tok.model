item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december   substantially all of our revenue was directly or indirectly derived from reimbursements generated by medicare advantage health plans 
as a result  our revenue and profitability are dependent on government funding levels for medicare advantage programs 
see item description of business medicare  medicare modernization act 
for the twelve months ended december   approximately of our revenue came from the humana agreements 
the humana agreements have one year terms and renew automatically each december for additional one year terms unless terminated for cause or upon days prior notice 
failure to maintain the humana agreements on favorable terms would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the humana agreements and the cms agreement are risk agreements under which the psn and the hmo  respectively  receive net monthly payments per participating customer at a rate established by the agreements  also called a capitated fee 
in accordance with the agreements  the capitated fee is a function of the number of participating customers  regardless of the actual utilization rate of covered services 
to the extent that the participating customers require more care than is anticipated  aggregate capitation fees may be insufficient to cover the costs associated with the treatment of such customers 
if medical expenses exceed our estimates  except in very limited circumstances  we will be unable to increase the premiums we receive under these contracts during the then current terms 
relatively small changes in our ratio of medical expense to revenue can create significant changes in our financial results 
accordingly  the failure to adequately predict and control medical expenses and to make reasonable estimates and maintain adequate accruals for incurred but not reported ibnr claims  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
see item a 
risk factors for further discussion of the most significant risks that affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements 
actual results may ultimately differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  including those that are perceived to be the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require complex and or subjective judgments by management 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies include use of estimates  revenue  expense and receivables and use of estimates  deferred tax asset 
use of estimates  revenue  expense and receivables 
revenue is primarily derived from risk based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed and paid to us on a monthly basis 
we assume the economic risk of funding our customers health care services and related administrative costs 
premium revenue is recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services 
because we have the obligation to fund medical expenses we recognize gross revenue and medical expenses for these contracts in our consolidated financial statements 
we record health care premium payments we receive in advance of the service period as unearned premiums 
cms periodically retroactively adjusts the premiums paid to us based on the updated health status of participants 
the factors considered in this update include changes in demographic factors  risk adjustment scores  customer information and adjustments required by the risk sharing requirements for prescription drug benefits under part d of the medicare program 
in addition  cms also retroactively adjusts the number of customers enrolled in our hmo or psn as a result of enrollment changes not yet processed  or not yet reported by humana or cms 
these retroactive adjustments could  in the near term  materially impact the revenue that has been recorded by us for both our hmo and psn 
we record any adjustments to this revenue at the time the information necessary to make the determination of the adjustment is received from humana or cms and the collectibility of the amount is reasonably assured 
medical expenses for both the psn and hmo are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of our obligations for medical services that have been provided to our customers but for which we have either not yet received or processed claims  and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical expense disputes 
we develop estimates for medical expense incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied 
the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt  claim backlogs  care provider contract rate changes  medical care consumption and other medical expense trends 
the actuarial process and models develop a range of projected medical claims payable and we accrue to the low end of the range 
we accrue to the low end of the range  in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss  which states that when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum amount should be accrued 
we estimate liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical expense disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
each period  we re examine previously established medical claims payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances 
as the liability estimate recorded in prior year periods become more exact  we adjust the amount of our liability estimates  and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the change is identified 
in each reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical expense payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
while we believe our medical expenses payable are adequate to cover future claims payments required  such estimates are based on claims experience to date and various assumptions 
therefore  the actual liability could differ materially from the amounts recorded 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements and risk factors a failure to estimate incurred but not reported use of estimates  deferred tax asset 
we have recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately million at december  realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the future 
in order to utilize the deferred tax assets  we would have to generate taxable income of approximately million 
we believe that our current operations will generate sufficient income to fully utilize this asset 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could change in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are modified and those changes could be material see notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the event we determine that we cannot  on a more likely than not basis  realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to establish a deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination is made 
net operating loss carryforwards by year of expiration are as follows year of expiration amount    pending adoption of an accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in the tax return and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt fin as of january   as required 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin will be recorded in retained earnings and other accounts as applicable 
we are currently evaluating the effect this interpretation will have on our financial position  liquidity and statement of income 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 
adoption of recent accounting pronouncement during the fourth quarter of  we adopted the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when qualifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
we determined that in we had included in our operating loss carryforward a tax benefit of approximately  that related to a subsidiary that had previously been liquidated 
as a result of the prior liquidation of this subsidiary  the losses related to that subsidiary were not available to us and should not have been included in our deferred tax benefit when that benefit was realized in as a result of a reduction of the valuation allowance 
we evaluated this matter using both the balance sheet iron curtain and income statement rollover approaches and concluded that the impact of this error was not material in we have determined that the impact of correcting this misstatement is material in and  therefore  as allowed by sab  have recorded this as a cumulative effect change in the consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity

as of december   we had no long term debt and no payment obligations that would constitute capital lease obligations 
impact of inflation inflation has a significant impact on the cost of medical care 
according to a report issued in february by the office of the actuary at cms  health care outlays are projected to grow at a rate of annually between and the projected principal drivers for this growth include continued cost increasing medical innovation  inflation  continued strong demand for prescription drugs and the aging baby boomer demographic 
we seek to minimize the impact of these increases by developing fixed fee or capitated arrangements that run for multiple years and which include built price increases that are more in line with the projected increases in medicare reimbursement  which we are estimating to be approximately annually

in both and  we operated in two financial reporting segments  the psn business and the medicare advantage hmo business 
the psn reported a segment gain before income taxes and allocated overhead of million for the year ended december   an increase of million or increase as compared to the prior year 
the hmo segment  which commenced operations in july  incurred a net loss before income taxes and allocated overhead of million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million in allocated overhead amounted to million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively

the humana related revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of approximately 
the increase in humana related revenue in the humana increase is primarily attributable to o approximately million in rate increase of which million of the increase related to medicare part d  and o medicare risk adjustments mra that were retroactively approved by cms in for and approximately  of the humana increase 
cms adjusts the payments made to health plans based on changes on the mra score 
the purpose of risk adjustment is to use health status indicators to improve the accuracy of payments and establish incentives for plans to enroll and treat less healthy medicare beneficiaries

in and  the portion of risk adjusted payment was increased to and  respectively 
the portion of risk adjusted payment increased to in  with a phase in of risk adjusted payment in the retroactive payments increased revenue in this humana increase was primarily offset by a decrease in humana participating customer months from  in to  in  which decreased humana related revenue by approximately million 
as previously discussed  the decline in customer months in from was primarily a result of the termination of the contractual relationship with certain physicians during the last half of the psn s average per customer per month premium increased during approximately in the central florida market and in the south florida market as compared to this increase is substantially due to the part d premium  which began in based on the payments we have received from humana in early  we believe that the per customer per month premium from humana will increase approximately to from the fee for service revenue represents amounts earned from medical services provided to non humana customers in our owned physician practices 
revenue for the hmo was million in as compared to million in the hmo began generating revenue during the last two quarters of the increase in revenue in is primarily attributable to the increase in our customer base during and the operation of the hmo for the full year 
included in the hmo s revenue is approximately  attributable to mra scores that were retroactively approved by cms in for we have estimated that the retroactive mra score adjustment in for will not have a material impact on our revenue

total operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of over in we incurred approximately million in expenses related to our hmo division  compared to million in total medical expenses total medical expenses represent the total costs of providing patient care and are comprised of two components  direct medical expenses and other medical expenses 
total medical expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our medical expense ratio increased from in to in the current year 
approximately or of our total medical expenses in are attributable to direct medical services such as inpatient and outpatient services  pharmacy benefits and physician services by non affiliated providers 
in  approximately or of our total medical expenses were attributable to direct medical services 
the increase is due  in part  to the fact that the hmo was in operation for all of and the hmo s direct medical expenses increased by approximately million 
the psn s direct medical expenses increased by approximately million  primarily as a result of the drug costs associated with the part d benefit implemented in other medical expenses include the salaries  taxes and benefits of the psn s affiliated health professionals providing primary care services  as well as other costs associated with the operations of those practices 
approximately million of our total medical expenses in related to physician practices we own as compared to million in because the humana agreements provide that the psn is financially responsible for all medical services provided to the humana participating customers  direct medical expenses include the cost of medical services provided to humana participating customers by providers other than the psn s affiliated providers non affiliated providers 
the medical expense ratio for the psn segment improved to in as compared to in during  the psn implemented various medical management techniques to improve the medical management of our customers 
some of these techniques included chart audits for all psn physicians  increasing our focus on certain elements of our partners in quality program  implementing an outreach program for our more acutely ill customers in an effort to better manage the care for these individuals and developing a comprehensive recovery plan for customers that had serious events  such as hospitalizations or significant procedures 
during  the psn incurred approximately million of medical expenses related to the implantation of certain implantable automatic defibrillators aicd 
cms has directed that the costs of certain of these procedures that meet eligibility requirements be paid by cms rather than billed to medicare advantage plans 
at december   we had estimated a recovery for aicd claims we had paid at december  of approximately million  which was recorded as a reduction of medical expenses in during  we continued to work with humana to make certain that these cases met the eligibility criteria for payment by cms 
as a result of this effort  during we collected approximately  of this amount and recorded a charge of million to medical expenses to reflect management s concern about the ultimate collectibility of this amount in light of  among other things  revised guidance by cms regarding its reimbursement policies 
at december  we estimated future recoveries of approximately  related to aicds implanted in these amounts decreased our medical expense ratio by in and increased our medical expense ratio by 
in on february   cms sent a notice to all medicare advantage organizations that certain formulas that had previously been provided by cms for involving in the part d risk corridor calculations were in error and needed to be corrected 
these formulas related to fixed and flexible capitated part d payment demonstration target amounts 
the hmo was not impacted by these formula errors however  the psn  through humana  provides drug coverage that includes these types of arrangements 
since this formula error impacted  we computed the impact and decreased our revenue by approximately million for the estimated amount that we will be required to refund back to cms through humana 
the hmo s medical expense ratio in was as compared to in substantially all of this increase was attributed to the rapid growth of hmo in  which  among other things  negatively impacted the medical management process and also resulted in higher than expected costs paid for medical services 
during  as a part of the medical management process  primary care physicians were required to pre approve all medical services provided to the customer 
we have determined that this pre approval requirement was not effective and resulted in excess utilization and higher than expected costs paid for medical services 
in early  we have changed this process and now require the hmo s medical director pre approve for certain services 
as a result of the increased number of customers  the hmo is renegotiating the rates paid to certain hospitals and providers of outpatient services 
we anticipate that as our customer base continues to grow  we will be able to positively impact our hmo s medical expense ratio by entering into more capitated  rather than fee for service  contracts 
at december   we estimated our ibnr accrual for the hmo was between million and million and we recorded a liability of million 
at december   our ibnr accrual was estimated to be  claims paid for in totaled  which exceeded the estimated accrual by  this difference was recorded as additional claims expense in the ibnr for the psn at december  was determined to be between million and million and  as is our policy  we recorded an accrual of million 
at december   the ibnr accrual was estimated to be million compared to actual claims paid in for of million  a difference of  this difference increased medical expense in administrative payroll  payroll taxes and benefits administrative payroll  taxes and benefits include salaries and related costs for our executive  administrative and sales staff

administrative payroll  taxes and benefit costs associated with the hmo segment were million in as compared to million in  an increase of approximately 
the hmo commenced operations in and these costs were incurred for only a portion of the year 
in addition  during we increased the number of full time equivalents employed by the hmo from to as the number of customers enrolled in the hmo increased 
as the hmo increased in size and activity we also increased our corporate staff from at december  to at december   resulting in an increase in administrative payroll  taxes and benefits to million in as compared to million in  a increase 
substantially all of this increase is a result of the addition of new employees or a full year of compensation for employees added in with approximately  of the increase related to stock based compensation expense

in  we continued to brand our plan and also increased our marketing and advertising for new customers 
commencing in  cms instituted a limited enrollment period for medicare advantage plans between november and march which increased our marketing and advertising costs during the last quarter of we expect that these costs will decline slightly in general and administrative general and administrative expenses for amounted to million  an increase of million  or over the prior year 
approximately million of this increase is attributable to the hmo being operational for all of the hmo incurred increased costs of  for claims processing and customer services costs   in professional services fees primarily attributable to the expansion in   in lease costs relating to rents for the entire year and  in recruitment costs 
corporate general and administrative costs increased approximately  as a result of an increase in fees paid to our board of directors of  professional service costs of approximately  recruitment costs of  and lease costs of  other income expense we realized other income of  in compared to million in the increase was primarily as a result of an increase in investment income of  as we had more cash to invest and rates increased over cash is invested in highly liquid securities  primarily certificates of deposits with short term maturities and money market fund

liquidity and capital resources total cash and equivalents at december  totaled approximately million as compared to approximately million at december  as of december   we had a working capital surplus of approximately million as compared to a working capital surplus of approximately million as of december   a decrease of approximately million or 
this decrease is primarily a result of decreasing the current portion of the deferred tax asset between and by million 
the hmo is required to maintain statutory minimum net worth requirements established by the florida state department of insurance 
at december   the statutory minimum net worth requirements was approximately million and actual net deficit was approximately million 
subsequent to year end  we transferred approximately million to the hmo so that the hmo complies with all applicable statutory requirements 
at december  the statutorily restricted cash and cash equivalents totals million  including the million transferred subsequent to year end as an addition to statutory net worth 
the hmo is restricted from making dividend payments without appropriate regulatory notifications and approvals or to the extent such dividends would put them in non compliance with statutory net worth requirements 
at december   all of the hmo s cash and cash equivalents are subject to these dividend restrictions 
statutorily restricted cash is available for us to pay the liabilities of the hmo 
our total stockholder equity increased approximately million  or  from approximately million at december  to approximately million at december  we have an investment policy with respect to the investment of our cash and equivalents 
the investment policy goal is to obtain the highest yield possible while investing only in highly rated instruments or investments with nominal risk of loss of principal 
the investment policy sets forth a list of permitted investments and provides that any exceptions to the policy must be approved by the chief financial officer or the chief executive officer 
at december   we had no outstanding debt 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  constituted approximately million 
the significant sources of cash from operating activities were o an increase in estimated medical expenses payable of million  o an increase in amounts due to cms of million  o net income of  o a decrease in deferred income taxes of  o an increase in net accounts receivable of  o depreciation and amortization of  and o an increase in accrued expenses of  million 
the major use of cash in operating activities was an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of  our increase in estimated medical expenses payable  also known as ibnr  is primarily attributable to the growth of the hmo 
the hmo began operations in july and had  customers at december  during  our customer base increased to  customers at december  in addition  the hmo s medical expenses increased from million in to million in these factors significantly contributed to the increase in the ibnr 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million of which million was related to capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was approximately  which consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
on may  we executed a one year unsecured commercial line of credit agreement with a bank  which provides for borrowings and issuance of letters of credit of up to million 
this line of credit has been extended to march the outstanding balance  if any  bears interest at the bank s prime rate 
the credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants  including a minimum liquidity requirement of million 
the availability under the line of credit secures a million letter of credit that we have caused to be issued in favor of humana 
this arrangement allows for million of cash  which was formerly invested in a certificate of deposit and recognized as restricted cash on our balance sheets  to be available for operations 
we have not utilized this commercial line of credit in or our hmo continues to require a considerable amount of capital 
in  we contributed approximately million to the hmo to finance the operations and growth of the hmo 
in the year ended december  the hmo s business generated an million segment loss before allocated overhead and income taxes 
although we expect that revenue will exceed total medical expenses  we anticipate that the hmo will continue to generate a loss in before allocated overhead and income taxes 
the amount of the loss will be determined by a number of factors including medical utilization and related costs  and our decisions related to expansion and growth efforts 
we are still not in a position to meaningfully estimate when  if ever  the hmo s business will become profitable and or generate cash from operations  and we may be required to fund the development and expansion of the hmo business  including any associated losses  for an extended period of time 
nonetheless  we anticipate that the on going development efforts  reserve requirements and operating costs for our still developing hmo business can be funded by our current resources and projected cash flows from operations until at least december  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we do not currently have any trading derivatives nor do we expect to have any in the future 
we have established policies and internal processes related to the management of market risks  which we use in the normal course of our business operations 
intangible asset risk we have intangible assets and perform goodwill impairment tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
as a result of our periodic evaluations  we may determine that the intangible asset values need to be written down to their fair values  which could result in material charges that could be adverse to our operating results and financial position 
we evaluate the continuing value of goodwill by using valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings  revenue  ebitda ie  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization particularly with regard to entities similar to us that have recently been acquired 
we also consider the market value of our own stock and those of companies similar to ours 
as of december  we believe our intangible assets are recoverable  however  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
we continue to monitor those assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets 
equity price risk we do not own any equity investments  other than in our subsidiaries 
as a result  we do not currently have any direct equity price risk 
commodity price risk we do not enter into contracts for the purchase or sale of commodities 
as a result  we do not currently have any direct commodity price risk
