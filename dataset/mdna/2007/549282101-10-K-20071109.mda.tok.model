item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the fiscal years ended august   august  and august  included in item of this report 
overview we generate revenues primarily by providing quality home style food to customers at our restaurants located throughout texas and four other states 
these establishments are located in close proximity to retail centers  business developments and residential areas 
we also provide culinary contract services for organizations that offer on site food service  such as health care facilities 
in august  we introduced our new cafeteria style prototype design  with the opening of our first new store in over seven years 
the new restaurant is on pace to generate an annual unit volume  or auv  in excess of million  an increase of as compared to our current average auv of million 
accounting periods our fiscal year ends on the last wednesday in august 
as such  each fiscal year normally consists of four week periods  or accounting periods  accounting for days in the aggregate 
each of the first three quarters of each fiscal year consists of three four week periods  while the fourth quarter normally consists of four four week periods 
both fiscal and were week years  while fiscal was a week year for us  with the extra week occurring in the fourth quarter 
comparability between quarters may be affected by the varying lengths of the quarters  as well as the seasonality associated with the restaurant business 
same store sales the restaurant business is highly competitive with respect to food quality  concept  location  price  and service  all of which may have an effect on same store sales 
our same store sales calculation measures the relative performance of a certain group of restaurants 
to qualify for inclusion in this group  a store must have been in operation for consecutive accounting periods 
although management believes this approach leads to more effective year over year comparisons  neither the time frame nor the exact practice may be similar to those used by other restaurant companies 
same store sales decreased for fiscal year same store sales increased and for fiscal years and  respectively 
our calculation of same store sales remove the additional week of sales in fiscal and compare sales year over year for periods that include approximately the same calendar dates 
this approach was also applied to same store sales for fiscal quarters  adjusting for the additional week in fiscal fourth quarter the following table shows the same store sales change for comparative historical quarters increase decrease fiscal fiscal fiscal q q q q q q q q q q q q same store sales hurricane impact hurricane rita impacted a number of our markets during the first quarter of fiscal as we were forced to temporarily close many stores due to mandatory evacuations and subsequent power outages 
we experienced a store closure impact of store days of operations due to hurricane rita 
one unit in port arthur  texas suffered permanent damage and the lease has been terminated 
all other restaurants impacted by the storm suffered minimal damage and were reopened soon after the storm passed 
the store closure impact on our results of operations was offset by increased traffic at certain units and catering events relating to the hurricane relief effort 
minimum wage increase impact the new federal minimum wage increase took effect on july  as a percentage of total employees  those previously earning below the first increase in the minimum wage to represented less than percent of our total workforce 
while this percentage is relatively small  we expect to experience a compression due to the minimum wage increase  meaning that wages earned by employees within a certain range of the new minimum wage would be adjusted over time as the new minimum wage increases are phased in throughout the next three years 
to the extent prevailing market conditions allow  we intend to adjust menu prices to maintain profit margins 
discontinued operations our business plan  as approved in fiscal year and completed in fiscal year  called for the closure of more than locations 
in accordance with the plan  the entire fiscal activity of the applicable stores closed after the inception of the plan has been classified as discontinued operations 
results related to these same locations have also been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
results of operations fiscal weeks compared to fiscal weeks total sales decreased approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal restaurant sales decreased million  offset by million of culinary contract services revenue recognized in fiscal the million decline in restaurant sales included a million reduction in sales related to closed operations 
on a same store basis  sales decreased approximately million  or  due primarily to declines in guest traffic partially offset by higher menu prices and more favorable menu mix 
food costs decreased approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the lower sales volume offset by higher commodity prices for beef  seafood  poultry and oils 
our promotion of combination meals has provided favorable cost structures 
as a percentage of restaurant sales  food costs increased  from in fiscal to in fiscal payroll and related costs decreased approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  these costs decreased  from in fiscal to in fiscal  due to reduced restaurant sales and continued focus on labor productivity 
other operating expenses decreased approximately by million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  these costs increased and were driven by lower utility and advertising costs  offset by a million insurance recovery associated with a business claim related to hurricane rita  which we recorded as a reduction to operating expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increased capital expenditures in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of total sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  primarily due to lower bonus expense and professional consulting fees  partially offset by increased share based compensation expense 
the provision for asset impairments and restaurant closings decreased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to asset impairment and lease settlement costs recognized in offset by a lease settlement related to a closed location 
the net loss gain on disposition of property and equipment decreased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease is primarily due to the retirement of obsolete equipment that was identified during our fiscal review of restaurant equipment at all of our restaurants and at our houston service center 
interest income increased approximately million due to higher cash and short term investment balances 
interest expense decreased million 
other income  net  decreased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  due primarily to a decrease in prepaid state sales tax discounts resulting from lower sales in fiscal the income tax provision for fiscal was million compared to recognition of an income tax benefit of million in all of our net operating losses have been fully utilized and the provision for income taxes in is reflective of the tax effect of the pre tax income for the year 
our income tax benefit in fiscal primarily represents the recognition of tax benefits for net operating losses not recognized in previous years due to uncertainty regarding our ability to realize them 
the net loss from discontinued operations decreased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  principally due to lease settlement and asset impairment costs associated with discontinued operation in fiscal weeks compared to fiscal weeks sales increased approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal on a same store basis  sales increased approximately million  or 
excluding the additional  or rd  week of sales included in fiscal year  same store sales growth for fiscal was approximately million  or 
food costs increased approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due to slightly higher commodity prices for seafood and produce  which were partially offset by slightly lower commodity prices for poultry and dairy 
our promotion of combination meals have provided favorable cost structures 
as a percentage of sales  food costs decreased  from in fiscal to in fiscal payroll and related costs decreased approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales  these costs decreased  from in fiscal to in fiscal  due to operational focus and lower workers compensation expense  including the effects of reduced actuarial estimates of potential losses resulting from favorable claims experience 
other operating expenses increased by approximately million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales these costs increased  and were driven by higher utilities costs as well as higher restaurant supply and repair and maintenance costs  while being partially offset by a million insurance recovery associated with a business interruption claim due to hurricane rita  recorded as a reduction to operating expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increased capital expenditures in fiscal relocation and voluntary severance costs decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal since no costs of this nature were incurred during fiscal during fiscal  we incurred costs of approximately million related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters to houston  texas

interest expense  decreased approximately million  in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to an million write off of the unamortized portion of the discount associated with convertible subordinated notes upon their conversion to common stock in august  in combination with the elimination of outstanding debt and lower interest rates following the refinancing of our outstanding indebtedness in interest income decreased by approximately million 
other income  net  increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the increase in prepaid state sales tax discounts and the write off of expired gift certificates 
the income tax benefit for fiscal primarily represents the recognition of tax benefits for net operating losses not recognized in previous years due to uncertainty regarding our ability to realize them 
see note  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
unlike recent fiscal years  when income tax expenses and benefits were not recognized due to unutilized net operating losses and related valuation allowance  our provision for income taxes in future periods will be reflective of the tax effect of the pre tax income losses recognized in those periods once all of our net operating losses are fully utilized 
additionally  the recently enacted texas franchise tax will impact future income tax provisions 
the net loss from discontinued operations decreased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  principally because we no longer have any deferred financing costs or interest associated with closed stores in liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short term investments cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million from the end of fiscal to august   primarily due to cash flows from operations partially offset by capital expenditures
