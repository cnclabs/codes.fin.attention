table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion and analysis set forth below in this item for the fiscal year ended march  and has been amended to reflect the restatement as described in the explanatory note and in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for this reason  the data set forth in this section may not be comparable to discussions and data in the company s previously filed annual reports on form k 
all dollar amounts are presented in thousands unless otherwise noted 
restatement through march  background on november   black box received a letter of informal inquiry from the enforcement division of the sec relating to the company s stock option practices from january  to present 
as a result  the audit committee  with the assistance of outside legal counsel  commenced an independent review of the company s historical stock option grant practices and related accounting for stock option grants during the review period 
on february   the company announced that  while the review of option grant practices was continuing  it believed that it would need to record additional non cash charges for stock based compensation expense relating to certain stock option grants and  accordingly  cautioned investors about relying on its historical financial statements until the company could determine with certainty whether a restatement would be required and  if so  the extent of any such restatement and the periods affected 
on march   although the audit committee had not yet completed its review  the audit committee concluded that the exercise price of certain stock option grants differed from the fair market value of the underlying shares on the appropriate measurement date 
at that time  the company and the audit committee announced that it was currently expected that the company s additional non cash  pre tax charges for stock based compensation expense relating to certain stock option grants would approximate million for the review period 
in addition  the company and the audit committee concluded that the company would need to restate its previously issued financial statements contained in reports previously filed by the company with the sec 
accordingly  on march   the company and the audit committee concluded that the company s previously issued financial statements and other historical financial information and related disclosures for the review period  including applicable reports of its current or former independent registered public accounting firms and related press releases  should not be relied upon 
on may   the company was advised by the enforcement division of the sec that a formal order of private investigation arising out of the company s stock option practices had been entered and on may  the company received a subpoena that was issued by the sec 
on may   the company announced that  as a result of the ongoing review of stock option practices  company management and the audit committee expected that the company s additional non cash  pre tax charges for stock based compensation expense relating to certain stock option grants would approximate million for the review period 
findings of the audit committee during the review period  the company granted stock options pursuant to an employee stock option plan and a director stock option plan to acquire approximately million shares of common stock 
such plans at all relevant times provided for option grants to be approved by a designated committee of non employee directors or  in the case of the director stock option plan  by the board 
approximately  stock option grants were awarded during the review period with recorded grant dates 
no stock options have been granted since september  the audit committee reviewed all stock options granted during the review period  including option grants to the company s directors  officers and rank and file employees including grants to new employees  grants awarded in connection with company acquisitions and grants made as individual or group performance awards 
the audit committee s review of the company s stock option granting practices included a comprehensive examination of reasonably available relevant physical and electronic documents as well as interviews with current and former directors  officers and company personnel 
the audit committee s review was initially focused on determining whether the company s prior stock option granting practices were in compliance with the plans granting provisions and applicable law or called into question its accounting for such options 
once it became evident that such issues and accounting implications existed  the inquiry focused on those matters necessary to determine whether any accounting charges were material and whether a restatement of the company s previously issued financial statements would be required  to establish a basis for effecting any required restatement  to assure that  on as timely a basis as possible  the company could file any required curative disclosures with the sec and assure its continued eligibility for listing on 
table of contents nasdaq  and to provide an informed basis for the company s response to the identified issues  including appropriate corrective and remedial actions 
the following information summarizes certain of the findings of the audit committee 
the findings identified approximately million of unrecorded expense at the time of grant ie  the difference between the fair market value of the common stock on the appropriate measurement date and the stated exercise price  net of forfeitures  during the review period  of which million was recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements through march  and million of unrecorded expense at the time of grant will be included  beginning at april   in the company s computation of compensation expense in accordance with sfas r 
the following summarizes the unrecorded expense at the time of grant by time period and category of recipient million for the period from fiscal through fiscal million for directors  million for officers and million for rank and file employees million for the period from fiscal through august million for directors  million for officers and million for rank and file employees million for the period from august to the present million for directors  million for officers and million for rank and file employees the audit committee s additional key findings are summarized below lack of adequate documentation for a majority of grants issued by the company during the review period  there is either no or inadequate documentation of approval actions that satisfies the requisites for establishing a measurement date under apb of the recorded grant dates  there are documented approval actions by the board or the option or compensation committee with respect to particular grants for dates 
in the period december  to may   neither the minutes of the compensation committee nor of the board reflect any action to approve specific grants 
in some instances  evidence of single director the chairman of the compensation committee approval actions exists 
this absence of non employee director level documentation also applies to a majority of grants with a recorded grant date after in some cases  compensation committee minutes contain a reference to reports on the status of the option pool but do not document any action to approve specific grants 
approval documentation for certain grants has internal inconsistencies or conflicts with other documents thereby rendering this documentation unreliable as a basis for establishing a measurement date 
in some cases  the only existing documentation is the executed option agreement and or the entry of the option grant into the option database 
notwithstanding these approval documentation inadequacies  the company entered into option agreements with grantees and has honored such grants 
grant approvals during the review period  relatively few option grants were approved in complete compliance with the company s stock option plans 
available documentation reflects that the company approved option grants in a variety of ways 
with respect to the employee stock option plan  grants were approved by the compensation committee as contemplated by the plan at various times  by the full board in and  by a single director the chairman of the compensation committee on nine recorded grant dates during the period through and by the company s ceo at various times 
with respect to the director stock option plan  grants were generally approved by the designated board committee and  in a few cases  by the chairman of the compensation committee 
in one instance in  there is no conclusive documentary evidence of the approval of director grants other than the signed director option agreements 
the delegation of authority by the compensation committee to the ceo with respect to grants to rank and file employees was not fully documented 
however  there was an understood and accepted practice between the ceo and the compensation committee whereby the ceo made certain awards to individual employees 
in some instances  this involved the allocation among rank and file employees of blocks of shares approved by the compensation committee  in three such instances  the number of shares ultimately awarded pursuant to this process exceeded the approved size of the block  which was contrary to the understanding of the compensation committee members 
further  contrary to the understanding of the compensation committee members  the award and or documentation of those individual grants often significantly lagged the approval of the block grant 
in august  the compensation committee specifically acknowledged a prior grant of delegated authority to the ceo to make option grants to rank and file employees and ratified all prior awards by the ceo 
in some cases  documentation of approval action is either inconclusive or missing  and the company therefore has been unable to determine what entity or person actually approved specific grants 
option pricing the recorded grant dates for a majority of grants do not match the applicable measurement dates as determined under apb the grants of options with exercise prices lower than the fair market values of the stock on the actual measurement dates did not satisfy the fair market pricing requirement in the company s plans  as amended in  and were not consistent with the company s disclosures in sec filings stating that the exercise price of options was equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of the grant 

table of contents the relationship between the stated exercise price of options and the fair market value of the company s stock on the date of the identifiable approval actions varied from grant to grant 
in some cases  the exercise price of grants reflected the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of any documented approval action 
in other cases  the exercise prices reflected the fair market value of the underlying shares on a date either prior or subsequent to any such documented approval action and the exercise price was lower than the fair market value on the date of any such action 
in several such cases before august  the use of such grant dates and lower exercise prices together with other available evidence supports a finding that the recorded grant dates and corresponding exercise prices were selected with the benefit of hindsight 
for certain grants where the mismatch between the recorded grant date and the approval action was only a matter of days  however  the mismatch appears to have been attributable to inaccurate recording or administrative delays 
in some cases  the apparent approval action did not identify all grantees  for example  there are cases where a block grant was approved subject to a later determination of individual grant recipients and grants were recorded with a grant date  and corresponding exercise price  that matched the date of the apparent approval of the block grant and the fair market value of the common stock on that date although individual grant recipients may have been identified some time after approval of the block grant 
finally  in some cases  the approval action for specific grants is not adequately documented 
where the recorded grant date did not satisfy the requisites for a measurement date under apb  the company relied on default methodologies to determine an appropriate measurement date 
internal controls as outlined above  the company s historical administration of its options program lacked discipline as it relates to proper adherence to the plan requirements  corporate recordkeeping and documentation 
since november  however  the company has properly administered the stock option program as it relates to awards to directors and officers 
during the investigation  the company identified control gaps related to grants made throughout the review period 
as of march   the company implemented additional procedures to its process that are focused on formalized documentation of appropriate approvals and determination of grant terms to employees 
procedural and remedial actions the audit committee and other relevant board committees are committed to a continued review and implementation of procedural enhancements and remedial actions in light of the foregoing findings 
consistent with its obligation to act in the best interests of the company taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances  the audit committee is continuing to assess the appropriateness of a broad range of possible procedural enhancements and potential remedial measures in light of the findings of its review 
while the audit committee has not completed its consideration of all such steps  procedural enhancements may include recommendations regarding improved stock option administration procedures and controls  training and monitoring compliance with those procedures  corporate recordkeeping  corporate risk assessment  evaluation of the internal compliance environment and other remedial steps that may be appropriate 
any such procedural enhancements will be recommended by the audit committee to the board and or appropriate board committee for adoption 
in advance of action by the audit committee  as noted above  the company has implemented additional procedures to its process for approving stock option grants that are focused on formalized documentation of appropriate approvals and determination of grant terms to employees 
in light of the findings of the audit committee s review  william f 
andrews  thomas w 
golonski and thomas g 
greig  three current directors who also served during portions of the review period and who hold options as to which the measurement date was adjusted in connection with the company s restatement  agreed voluntarily to reprice those outstanding options with a recorded exercise price less than the fair market value of the common stock on the accounting measurement date as determined by the audit committee so that the exercise price matches the fair market value of the common stock on such accounting measurement date 
in addition  michael mcandrew  who became the company s cfo in december   also agreed voluntarily to reprice the one option granted to him after he became cfo with a recorded exercise price less than the fair market value of the common stock on the accounting measurement date as determined by the audit committee so that the exercise price matches the fair market value of the common stock on such accounting measurement date 
the audit committee s ongoing review includes an evaluation of the role of and possible claims or other remedial actions against current and former company personnel who may be found to have had responsibility for identified problems during the review period 
accordingly  the audit committee has begun to address and is addressing and expects to continue to address issues of individual conduct or responsibility  including those of the board  ceos and cfos serving during the review period 
in connection therewith  based on the findings of the audit committee as to fred c 
young  the company s former ceo who resigned on may   the audit committee concluded and recommended to the board  and the board determined  that mr 
young could have been terminated due to cause for termination as defined in his agreement dated may  at the time mr 
young resigned as a director and officer of the company on may  in light of that determination and the terms of the agreements with mr 
young  all outstanding stock options held by mr 
young terminated as of the date of his resignation 
the audit committee may recommend additional remedial measures that appropriately address the issues raised by its findings 
such potential remedial measures may include an evaluation of the role of and possible claims or other remedial actions against current and former company personnel who may be found to have been responsible for identified problems during the review period 

table of contents restatement methodologies as of april   the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation expense is to be recognized for all share based compensation awards granted after the date of adoption and for all unvested awards existing on the date of adoption 
prior to april   the company accounted for stock based compensation awards to directors  officers and rank and file employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb as allowed under sfas under the intrinsic value method  no share based compensation expense related to stock options was required to be recognized if the exercise price of the stock option was at least equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the measurement date 
apb defines the measurement date as the first date on which are known both the number of shares that an individual grant recipient is entitled to receive and the option or purchase price  if any 
in light of the audit committee s review of the company s stock option granting practices during the review period and as to those cases in which the company previously used a recorded grant date as the measurement date that the company determined could no longer be relied upon  the company has developed and applied the following methodologies to remeasure those stock option grants and record the relevant charges in accordance with apb by considering the following sources of information i meeting minutes of the board and of committees thereof and related materials  ii unanimous written consents of the board and of committees thereof  iii create date  iv relevant email correspondence reflecting stock option grant approval actions  v individual stock option agreements and related materials  vi employee and board offer letters  vii documents relating to acquisitions  viii reports on form filed with the sec and ix guidance of the office of the chief accountant of the sec on stock option matters as set forth in its letter dated september  grants with appropriate committee approval 
with respect to grants of approximately million shares  or approximately of the total grants in the review period  the company has evidence to support the approval of the grant under the stock option plans by the relevant committee of the board  and such evidence includes the number of options each individual was entitled to receive and the option price 
however  the relationship between these documented approval actions and the originally recorded grant dates and exercise prices for the options so approved varied during the review period 
in some cases  grants were recorded with a grant date and a corresponding exercise price that matched the date of the approval action or were otherwise consistent with the terms of the approval action 
in other cases  however  the recorded grant dates and corresponding exercise prices of the grants reflected the fair market value of the common stock on a date prior to the committee s documented approval actions 
the company has restated the compensation expense for stock option grants relating to approximately million shares of common stock by using the date of the documented approval action as the measurement date 
the total additional non cash  pre tax charge for these grants is approximately million  net of forfeitures  amortized over the appropriate vesting period through march   of which million relates to director options  million relates to officer options and million relates to rank and file employee options 
grants with other approvals 
with respect to grants of approximately million shares  or approximately of the total grants in the review period  the company has evidence to support the approval of the grant by the board  an outside director or the company s ceo and the identification of the number of options each individual was entitled to receive together with the option price 
these grants are distinguished from the grants described in the prior paragraph in that the nature of the approval was not fully consistent with the terms of the relevant stock option plan 
as with the grants discussed in the preceding paragraph  the relationship between these documented approval actions and the originally recorded grant dates and exercise prices for the options so approved varied during the review period 
in some cases  grants were recorded with a grant date and a corresponding exercise price that matched the date of the approval action or were otherwise consistent with the terms of the approval action 
in other cases  however  the recorded grant dates and corresponding exercise prices of the grants reflected the fair market value of the company s stock on a date prior to the approval action 
the company has restated the compensation expense for stock option grants relating to approximately million shares of common stock by using the date of the documented approval action as the measurement date 
the total additional non cash  pre tax charge for these grants is approximately million  net of forfeitures  amortized over the appropriate vesting period through march   of which million relates to director options  million relates to officer options and million relates to rank and file employee options 
grants lacking adequate documentation 
with respect to grants of approximately million shares million shares to rank and file employees  or of the total grants in the review period  the company has been unable to locate adequate documentation of approval actions that would satisfy the requisites for a measurement date under apb for these grants  management considered all available relevant information to form a reasonable conclusion as to the most reasonable measurement date 
for all grants in this category  the company has established default methodologies for determining the most appropriate measurement date under apb with respect to grants entered into the company s stock option database after september   when the database began to reflect a create date which is the date on which a grant was entered into the system  the company has determined to use the individual create date for each grant as the apb measurement date  which was in most cases different from the originally recorded grant date 
the company believes that this create date is the most appropriate methodology in the absence of sufficient evidence of approvals for these grants as it represents the earliest point in time at which the evidence shows that all requisites for the establishment of the measurement date had been satisfied 
such create dates preceded  often by a significant amount of time  the execution of stock option 
table of contents agreements  which  generally  were manually signed by the company s ceo and manually signed and dated by the grantee 
in addition  in almost all cases  a grant entered into the database  which established the create date  ultimately resulted in the creation of a stock option agreement reflecting such grant 
accordingly  while execution of the stock option agreements constituted a clear acknowledgement by the grantee and the company of the grantee s legal entitlement to the grant  the company believes the create date more accurately reflects the date of approval than does the signed option agreement 
the company has restated the compensation expense for stock option grants relating to approximately million shares of common stock by using the create date as the measurement date 
the total additional non cash  pre tax charge for these grants is approximately million  net of forfeitures  amortized over the appropriate vesting period through march   of which million relates to director options  million relates to officer options and million relates to rank and file employee options 
the company s procedures for evaluating the appropriateness of measurement dates fixed with reference to such create dates included a sensitivity analysis which provided an understanding of the differences between the additional recorded charge for stock based compensation expense and the charges that would result from using other identified alternative methods for determining measurement dates 
the company s sensitivity analysis included identifying the range of potential grant dates defined by the recorded grant date and the create date for each grant 
the company then identified the low and high closing prices of the common stock within that range of potential grant dates and applied both the low and high closing prices of the common stock to the number of shares granted for which the create date methodology was utilized to determine the range of potential adjustments to stock based compensation expense for these grants  which was million to million  net of forfeitures  as compared to the additional non cash  pre tax charge for these grants of approximately million  net of forfeitures  included in the restatement 
for options entered into the company s option database before september   the company determined the measurement date generally by reference to signed option agreements or the deemed signature date for certain options as discussed below 
the executed option agreements hereinafter signed option agreements  manually signed by the company s ceo and manually signed and dated by the grantee  constituted an acknowledgement by the grantee and the company of the grantee s legal entitlement to the grant and  in the absence of authoritative information as to when all the requisites for the establishment of the measurement date had been satisfied  provides a measurement date framework based on entitlement 
the company has restated the compensation expense for stock option grants relating to approximately million shares of common stock by using the signed option agreements as the measurement date 
the total additional non cash  pre tax charge for these grants is approximately million  net of forfeitures  amortized over the appropriate vesting period through march   of which million relates to director options  million relates to officer options and million relates to rank and file employee options 
the company believes this methodology was the most appropriate in the absence of sufficient evidence of approvals for these grants as it represents the earliest point in time at which the evidence shows that all requisites for the establishment of the measurement date had been satisfied for these grants 
the company s procedures for evaluating the appropriateness of measurement dates fixed with reference to the dating of signed option agreements included a sensitivity analysis which provided an understanding of the differences between the additional recorded charge for stock based compensation expense and the charges that would result from using other identified alternative methods for determining measurement dates 
the company s sensitivity analysis included identifying the range of potential grant dates defined by the recorded grant date and the date of the grantee s signature on the stock option agreement for each grant 
the company then identified the low and high closing prices of the common stock within that range of potential grant dates and applied both the low and high closing prices of the common stock to the number of shares granted for which the signed option agreements methodology was utilized to determine the range of potential adjustments to stock based compensation expense for these grants  which was million to million  net of forfeitures  as compared to the additional non cash  pre tax charge for these grants of approximately million  net of forfeitures  included in the restatement 
in those cases where no reliably dated signed option agreement could be located and where no post september  create date exists stock option grants totaling approximately million shares  the company used the average period between recorded grant date and date of the signatures on all other grantee signed option agreements with the same grant date as the measurement date 
for example  if there were four stock option grants with a grant date of january   the company had the signed option agreements for three of these stock option grants and the average number of days between the grant date and the signature dates of these three signed option agreements was days  january  was used as the measurement date for the grant for which no signed option agreement could be located 
the company has restated the compensation expense for stock option grants relating to approximately million shares of common stock using this average days to sign agreement method 
the total additional non cash  pre tax charge for these grants is approximately million  net of forfeitures  amortized over the appropriate vesting period through march   of which million relates to director options  million relates to officer options and million relates to rank and file employee options 
the company believes this methodology was the most appropriate in the absence of sufficient evidence of approvals for these grants because it gives a reasonable approximation of the measurement date related to these options in light of the available evidence 
the company conducted a sensitivity analysis by comparing the company s current default methodology ie  average days to sign agreement with another default methodology 
for this analysis  the company identified the range of potential grant dates defined by the earliest signed option agreement and the latest signed option agreement 
the company then identified the low and high closing prices of the common stock over the range of potential grant dates and applied both the low and high closing prices of the common stock to the number of shares granted to determine the range of potential adjustments to stock based compensation expense for these grants  which was million to million  net of forfeitures 
the company s analyses indicate that stock based compensation expense computed using other identified alternative default methodologies would not materially differ from stock based compensation expense computed using the average days to sign agreement methodology 
the company s procedures for evaluating the appropriateness of measurement dates fixed with reference to the average days to sign agreements also 
table of contents included a sensitivity analysis which provided an understanding of the differences between the additional recorded charge for stock based compensation expense and the charges that would result from using other identified alternative methods for determining measurement dates 
the company s sensitivity analysis included identifying the range of potential grant dates defined by the recorded grant date and the average days to sign agreement for each grant 
the company then identified the low and high closing prices of the common stock within that range of potential grant dates and applied both the low and high closing prices of the common stock to the number of shares granted to determine the range of potential adjustments to stock based compensation expense for these grants  which was million to million  net of forfeitures  as compared to the additional non cash  pre tax charge for these grants of approximately million  net of forfeitures  included in the restatement 
given the volatility of the common stock during much of the review period  the use of methodologies and measurement dates different from those described above could have resulted in a higher or lower cumulative compensation expense which would have caused net income or loss to be different from the amounts reported in the restated consolidated financial statements 
the company s procedures for evaluating the appropriateness of measurement dates fixed using the default methodologies described above also included a sensitivity analysis which provided an understanding of the differences between the additional recorded charge for stock based compensation expense and the charges that would result from using other identified alternative methods for determining measurement dates 
the company s sensitivity analysis included identifying the range of potential grant dates defined by the recorded grant date and the appropriate measurement date for each grant 
the company then identified the low and high closing prices of the common stock within that range of potential grant dates and applied both the low and high closing prices of the common stock to the number of shares granted to determine the range of potential adjustments to stock based compensation expense for these grants  which was million to million  net of forfeitures  as compared to the additional non cash  pre tax charge for these grants of approximately million  net of forfeitures  included in the restatement 
other adjustments through march  from through  the company did not properly account for stock options for one officer that were modified after the grant date pursuant to a separation agreement 
some of these modifications were not identified in the company s financial reporting processes and were therefore not properly reflected in its financial statements 
as a result  the company has recorded a non cash charge for stock based compensation of million during fiscal summary in summary  the company recorded cumulative non cash charges for stock based compensation of million through march   offset in part by a cumulative income tax benefit of million  for a total after tax charge of million 
these charges had no impact on net sales or cash and cash equivalents as previously reported in the company s financial statements  as a result  no changes to these items are reflected in the restatement 
non cash charges for stock based compensation expense have been recorded as adjustments to selling  general administrative expenses within the company s consolidated statements of income 
q and q restatement stock based compensation expense in addition to the restatement noted above through march   the company has recorded additional non cash charges for stock based compensation during the first and second quarters of fiscal of million and million  respectively  offset in part by income tax benefits of million and million  respectively  or total after tax charges of million and million  respectively 
this charge was recorded to reflect additional non cash  stock based compensation expense recognized under the fair value method sfas r because the exercise price for certain stock option grants prior to  but not vested as of march   differed from the fair market value of the underlying shares on the appropriate measurement date  some of which occurred during fiscal accounting for derivatives on july   the company entered into an interest rate swap to reduce its exposure from fluctuating interest rates 
sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at their fair value  and that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
from inception of the hedge  the company had applied a method of cash flow hedge accounting under sfas to account for the interest rate swap that allowed the company to assume no ineffectiveness in such agreements  called the short cut method 
subsequently  the company analyzed its eligibility for the short cut method in light of certain clarifications delivered by the office of the chief accountant of the sec  and determined that its interest rate swap did not qualify for the short cut method under sfas because certain prepayment features relating to the underlying actual debt were not identical to those contained in the interest rate swap 
because the company s documentation at hedge inception reflected the short cut method rather than the long haul method for determining hedge ineffectiveness  the derivative did not meet the requirements for a cash flow hedge 
documentation for the long haul method of accounting at hedge inception cannot be retrospectively applied under sfas therefore  fluctuations 
table of contents in the interest rate swap s fair value should have been recorded through the company s consolidated statements of income instead of through oci  which is a component of stockholders equity 
the adjustment for the second quarter of fiscal will decrease reported net income and increase oci by approximately million 
this change in accounting for this derivative instrument could result in significant volatility in the company s reported net income and earnings per share due to increases and decreases in the fair value of the interest rate swap 
however  the derivative instrument remains highly effective and the change in accounting for this derivative instrument does not impact operating cash flows or total stockholders equity 
the table below reflects the impact of the additional non cash charges for stock based compensation expense and the non cash charge related to the interest rate swap on the company s consolidated statements of income  including the corresponding cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of september  and march    and on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
prior to this restatement  the company had not recorded any non cash stock based compensation expense in its consolidated statements of income with the exception of million recorded during the second quarter of fiscal for a modification of a previous stock option award for a retiring director

table of contents income tax considerations in the course of the investigation  the company determined that a number of officers may have exercised options for which the application of section m of the code may apply 
it is possible that these options will be treated as having been granted at less than fair market value for federal income tax purposes because the company incorrectly applied the measurement date as defined in apb if such options are deemed to have been granted at less than fair market value  pursuant to section m  any compensation to officers  including proceeds from options exercised in any given tax year  in excess of million will be disallowed as a deduction for tax purposes 
the company estimates that the potential tax effected liability for any such disallowed section m deduction would approximate million  which has been recorded as a current liability within income taxes within the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company may also incur interest and penalties if it were to incur any such tax liability  which could be material 
in addition  the company is considering the application of section a to those options for which it incorrectly applied the measurement date as defined in apb it is possible that these options will be treated as having been granted at less than fair market value for federal income tax purposes and thus subject to section a 
accordingly  the company may adopt measures to address the application of section a

the company computes a specific reserve by identifying specifically at risk accounts receivable and applying historic reserve factors to the outstanding balance 
the company computes a general reserve by reviewing the accounts receivable aging and applying reserve factors based upon the age of the account receivable 
if our estimate of uncollectible accounts receivable should prove inaccurate at some future date  the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the allowance for doubtful accounts

the company records an estimate for slow moving and obsolete inventory inventory reserve based upon product knowledge  physical inventory observation  future demand  market conditions and an aging analysis of the inventory on hand 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management at some future date  the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the inventory reserve 
deferred income taxes the company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets related to events that impact our financial statements and tax returns in different periods 
deferred tax asset and liability balances are computed by identifying differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities temporary differences which are multiplied by the current tax rate

if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of an asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
no impairments of long lived assets have been identified during any of the periods presented 
goodwill the company s goodwill is subject to  at a minimum  an annual impairment assessment of its carrying value 
goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
estimated fair values of the reporting units are estimated using an earnings model and a discounted cash flow valuation model 
the discounted cash flow model incorporates the company s estimates of future cash flows  allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units  future growth rates and management s judgment regarding the applicable discount rates used to discount those estimated cash flows 
if the company s estimates and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model should prove inaccurate at some future date  the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill

restructuring costs the company accrues the cost of restructuring activities in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance depending upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the situation 
the company exercises its judgment in estimating the total costs of each of these activities 
as these activities are implemented  the actual costs may differ from the estimated costs due to changes in the facts and circumstances that were not foreseen at the time of the initial cost accrual

table of contents amount of the estimated loss is recognized immediately in the financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business that include interest rate volatility and foreign currency exchange rates volatility 
market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year

as of march   an instantaneous basis point increase in the interest rate of the variable rate debt would reduce the company s net income in the subsequent fiscal year by  net of tax assuming the company employed no intervention strategies 
to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations associated with the company s variable rate long term debt  the company has implemented an interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility 
the company s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity by modifying the re pricing characteristics of certain balance sheet liabilities so that the net interest margin is not  on a material basis  adversely affected by the movements in interest rates 

table of contents on july   the company entered into an interest rate swap which has been used to effectively convert a portion of the company s variable rate debt to fixed rate

foreign exchange rate risk the company has operations  clients and suppliers worldwide  thereby exposing the company s financial results to foreign currency fluctuations 
in an effort to reduce this risk of foreign currency fluctuations  the company generally sells and purchases inventory based on prices denominated in us dollars 
intercompany sales to subsidiaries are generally denominated in the subsidiaries local currency 
the company has entered and will continue in the future  on a selective basis  to enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the foreign currency exposure related to certain intercompany transactions  primarily trade receivables and loans 
all of the foreign currency forward contracts have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the effective portion of any changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments is recorded in oci until the hedged forecasted transaction occurs or the recognized currency transaction affects earnings 
once the forecasted transaction occurs or the recognized currency transaction affects earnings  the effective portion of any related gains or losses on the cash flow hedge is reclassified from oci to the company s consolidated statements of income 
in the event it becomes probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  the ineffective portion of any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge would be reclassified from oci to the company s consolidated statements of income
