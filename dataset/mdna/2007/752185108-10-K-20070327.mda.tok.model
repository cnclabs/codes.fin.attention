table of contents during the corporation also realized  in total investment income  an increase of  from the  of investment income in the increase is attributable to growth in dividends and interest from portfolio companies  primarily occurring during the third and fourth quarters of dividend and other investment income grew primarily because of higher limited liability corporation llc distributions from companies in the portfolio that have improving operational trends  in particular gemcor ii  llc gemcor  topps meat company llc topps  and carolina skiff

critical accounting policies the corporation prepares its financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
for a summary of all significant accounting policies  including critical accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item the increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance require the corporation to closely monitor its accounting policies and procedures 
the corporation has identified two critical accounting policies that require significant judgment 
the following summary of critical accounting policies is intended to enhance your ability to assess the corporation s financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates 
valuation of investments the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of the corporation s consolidated financial statements is the valuation of its investments and the related unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
the corporation has adopted the sba s valuation guidelines for sbics  which describe the policies and procedures used in valuing investments 
investments are valued in accordance with the corporation s established valuation policy and are stated at fair value as determined in good faith by the management of the corporation and submitted to the board of directors for approval 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith 
as a result  determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for investments 
the board of directors considers fair value to be the amount which the corporation may reasonably expect to receive for portfolio securities when sold on the valuation date 
the corporation analyzes and values each individual investment on a quarterly basis  and records unrealized depreciation for an investment that it believes has become impaired  including where collection of a loan or realization of an equity security is doubtful 
conversely  the corporation will record unrealized appreciation if it believes that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  its equity security has also 
table of contents appreciated in value 
these estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed and these differences could be material if our assumptions and judgments differ from results of actual liquidation events 
in the valuation process  the corporation uses financial information received monthly  quarterly  and annually from its portfolio companies  which includes both audited and unaudited financial statements  annual projections and budgets prepared by the portfolio company and other financial and non financial business information supplied by the portfolio companies management 
this information is used to determine financial condition  performance  and valuation of the portfolio investments 
the valuation may be reduced if a company s performance and potential have significantly deteriorated 
if the factors which led to the reduction in valuation are overcome  the valuation may be restored 
another key factor used in valuing equity investments is recent arms length equity transactions with unrelated new investors entered into by the portfolio company that the corporation utilizes to form a basis for its underlying value 
many times the terms of these equity transactions may not be identical to the equity transactions between the portfolio company and the corporation  and the impact of the discrepancy in transaction terms on the market value of the portfolio company may be difficult or impossible to quantify 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in our statement of operations as net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation 
revenue recognition interest income interest income generally is recognized on the accrual basis except where the investment is in default or otherwise presumed to be in doubt 
in such cases  interest is recognized at the time of receipt 
a reserve for possible losses on interest receivable is maintained when appropriate 
certain investments of the corporation are structured to provide a deferred interest period when interest is not currently due 
rand sbic s interest accrual is also regulated by the sba s accounting standards and financial reporting requirements for small business investment companies 
under these rules interest income cannot be recognized if collection is doubtful  and a reserve must be established 
the collection of interest is presumed to be in doubt when there is substantial doubt about a portfolio company s ability to continue as a going concern or the loan is in default more than days 
management also utilizes other qualitative and quantitative measures to determine the value of a portfolio investment and the collectability of any accrued interest 
recent accounting pronouncements in june the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this interpretation clarifies that management is expected to evaluate an income tax position taken or expected to be taken for the likelihood of realization before recording any amounts for such position in the financial statements 
fin also requires expanded disclosure with respect to income tax positions taken that are not certain to be realized 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and will require management to evaluate every open tax position that exists in every jurisdiction on the date of initial adoption 
certain disclosures are required in form q in the period of adoption of fin which would be the march  form q 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy as defined in the standard 
additionally  companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding financial instruments in one of the categories level  including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of sfas no 
will have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements from a disclosure standpoint 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
due to diversity in practice 
table of contents among registrants  sab expresses sec staff views regarding the process by which misstatements in financial statements are evaluated for purposes of determining whether financial statement restatement is necessary 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

therefore  the corporation will invest in a mixture of debenture and equity instruments  which will provide a current return on a portion of the investment portfolio 
the equity features contained in our investment portfolio are structured to realize capital appreciation over the long term and may not necessarily generate current income in the form of dividends or interest 
in addition  the corporation earns interest income from investing its idle funds in money market instruments held at high grade financial institutions 

table of contents comparison of the years ended december  and december  december  increase increase interest from portfolio companies interest from other investments dividend and other investment income other income total investment income interest from portfolio companies the increase in portfolio interest income is attributable to the fact that there has been an increase in the number of investments that provide the corporation with current income

com interest from other investments the increase in interest income is primarily due to higher cash balances and higher yields on these cash balances 
the higher cash balances are a result of portfolio investment repayments and sales of portfolio companies equity instruments and draw downs on the sba leverage 
dividend and other investment income dividend income is comprised of distributions from limited liability companies llc s in which the corporation has invested 
the corporation s investment agreements with certain llc companies require the entities to distribute funds to the corporation for payment of income taxes on its allocable share of the entities profits 
these dividends will fluctuate based upon the profitability of the entities and the timing of the distributions 
dividend income for the year ended december  consisted of distributions from gemcor ii  llc gemcor for  topps for  carolina skiff llc carolina skiff for  and vanguard modular building systems vanguard for  dividend income for the year ended december  consisted of distributions from gemcor for  topps for  carolina skiff for  and vanguard for  other income other income consists of the revenue associated with the amortization of financing fees charged to the portfolio companies upon successful closing of rand sbic financing 
the sba regulations limit the amount of fees that can be charged to a portfolio company  and the corporation typically charges to to the portfolio concerns 
these fees are amortized ratably over the life of the instrument associated with the fees 
the unamortized fees are carried on the balance sheet under deferred revenue 
in addition  other income includes fees charged by the corporation to its portfolio companies for attendance at the portfolio companies board meetings 
the increase in other income is due to the fact that two of the corporation s portfolio companies  concentrix and innov x  paid off their debenture instruments early and therefore the remaining unamortized closing fees of  from concentrix and  from innov x were brought into income 
in addition  the corporation charged concentrix an  prepayment penalty fee that was included in other income 
the annualized financing fee income based on the existing portfolio will average  annually in and less than  annually thereafter  based on the deferred revenue balance at december  in addition the board attendance income amounted to  for the year ended december  and  for year ended december  
table of contents comparison of the years ended december  and december  december  increase increase decrease decrease interest from portfolio companies interest from other investments dividend and other investment income other income total investment income interest from portfolio companies portfolio interest income decreased  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the prior year 
this is attributable to the fact that the corporation ceased accruing interest on two wineisit 
com wineisit debt instruments in january in anticipation of a restructuring of the wineisit balance sheet 
the total interest recognized from these two wineisit notes for the year ended december  was  during this portfolio company experienced a decline in business performance and therefore the restructuring has been delayed 
these two notes are technically in default due to nonpayment of principal and interest and the corporation has revised their valuation 
see further discussion on this valuation change in the section labeled net change in unrealized appreciation depreciation of investments 
the current period decrease in portfolio income can also be attributed to the fact that the portfolio income for the year ended december  included  of income on a  convertible note from somerset 
this note had stopped accruing interest in september because it was in default and the corporation had established a reserve for the total accrued interest of  in april somerset became current on the note  therefore the corporation recognized all past due interest in the first quarter of interest from other investments the increase in interest income is primarily due to higher yields on cash balances 
dividend and other investment income dividend income for the year ended december  consisted of distributions from gemcor for  topps for  carolina skiff for  and vanguard for dividend income for the year ended december  was comprised of distributions from topps for  carolina skiff for  and vanguard for  other income other income for the year ended december  decreased slightly 
the decrease in financing amortization revenue can be attributed to the fact that several fees became fully amortized in early due to the instrument maturing 
the annualized financing fee income based on the existing portfolio will average  annually in and and less than  annually thereafter  based on the deferred revenue balance at december  in addition the board attendance income amounted to  for the year ended december  and for year ended december  operating expenses comparison of the years ended december  and december  december  increase increase total expenses operating expenses predominately consist of interest expense on sba debentures  employee compensation and benefits  directors fees  shareholder related costs  office expenses  professional fees  and expenses related to identifying and reviewing investment opportunities 
the increase in operating expenses during the year ended december  can be primarily attributed to the or  increase in sba interest expense 
the sba interest expense was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the corporation has borrowed  from the sba as of december  at an average borrowing rate  including surcharges  of approximately 
interest costs will continue to increase in and beyond as the 
table of contents corporation continues to draw down sba leverage up to the maximum approved leverage of million 
this interest is paid on a semi annual basis 
in addition  salary expense grew or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase is due to the officer pay increases and the fact that the executive officer bonuses increased by  in professional fees were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this represents an increase of which can be attributed to the escalating legal  audit and tax costs due to the increasingly more complex regulatory environment in which the corporation operates 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  december  increase increase total expenses operating expenses increased  or during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the prior year 
the increase in operating expenses can mainly be attributed to the establishment of a bad debt reserve for  on vanguard  and a increase in sba interest expense 
the corporation s management reviewed the interest receivable from vanguard and believed that the collectibilty of this receivable was in doubt and therefore reserved for all of the receivable balance 
the portfolio company continued to perform well and was then investigating sale opportunities
