engineers in our houston and denver offices perform all reserve estimates for our different geographical regions 
these reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by senior engineering staff and division management with final approval by the senior vice president with responsibility for corporate reserves 
during each of the years  and  we retained netherland  sewell associates  inc nsai  independent third party reserve engineers  to perform reserve audits of proved reserves 
a reserve audit  as we use the term  is a process involving an independent third party engineering firm s extensive visits  collection of any and all required geologic  geophysical  engineering and economic data  and such firm s complete external preparation of reserve estimates 
our use of the term reserve audit is intended only to refer to the collective application of the procedures which nsai was engaged to perform 
the term reserve audit may be defined and used differently by other companies 
the reserve audit for included a detailed review of of our major international  deepwater and domestic properties  which covered approximately of our total proved reserves 
the reserve audit for included a detailed review of of our major international  deepwater and domestic properties  which covered approximately of our total proved reserves 
the reserve audit for included a detailed review of of our major international  deepwater and domestic properties  which covered approximately of our total proved reserves 
in connection with the reserve audit  nsai performed its own estimates of our proved reserves 
in order to perform their estimates of proved reserves  nsai examined our estimates with respect to reserve quantities  future producing rates  future net revenue  and the present value of such future net revenue 
nsai also examined our estimates with respect to reserve categorization  using the definitions for proved reserves set forth in regulation s x rule a and subsequent securities and exchange commission sec staff interpretations and guidance 
in the conduct of the reserve audit  nsai did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by us with respect to ownership interests  oil and gas production  well test data  historical costs of operation and development  product prices  or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production 
however  if in the course of the examination something came to the attention of nsai which brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data  nsai did not rely on such information or data until they had satisfactorily resolved their questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data 
nsai determined that our estimates of reserves conform to the guidelines of the sec  including the criteria of reasonable certainty  as it pertains to expectations about the recoverability of reserves in future years  under existing economic and operating conditions  consistent with the definition in rule a of regulation s x 
nsai issued an unqualified audit opinion on our proved reserves at december   based upon their evaluation 
their opinion concluded that our estimates of proved reserves were  in the aggregate  reasonable 
the properties that nsai audits include our most significant properties and are chosen by senior engineering staff and division management with final approval by the senior vice president with responsibility for corporate reserves 
we usually include all deepwater fields  all international properties that require reports by requirement of the host government  all properties that require sanctioning by our board of directors  and other major properties 
no significant properties were excluded from the december  reserve audit 
when compared on a field by field basis  some of our estimates are greater and some are less than the estimates of nsai 
given the inherent uncertainties and judgments that go into estimating proved reserves  differences between internal and external estimates are to be expected 
on a quantity basis  the nsai estimates ranged from plus  mboe to minus  mboe as compared with our estimates 
on a percentage basis  the nsai estimates ranged from above our estimates to below our estimates 
differences between our estimates and those of nsai are reviewed for accuracy but are not further analyzed unless the aggregate variance is greater than 
at december   reserves differences  in the aggregate  were less than  mboe  or 
since january   no crude oil or natural gas reserve information has been filed with  or included in any report to any federal authority or agency other than the sec and the energy information administration eia of the us department of energy 
we file form  including reserve and other information  with the eia 
acquisition and divestiture activities we maintain an ongoing portfolio optimization program 
we may engage in acquisitions of additional crude oil or natural gas properties or related assets through either direct acquisitions of the assets or acquisitions of entities owning the assets 
we may also divest non core assets in order to maintain a balanced portfolio with high quality  core properties 
on july   we sold substantially all of our gulf of mexico shelf properties except for the main pass area  which continues to undergo repair work after suffering significant hurricane damage in and as of march   the effective date of the sale  proved reserves for the assets sold totaled approximately mmbbls of crude oil and bcf of natural gas 
gulf of mexico deepwater and gulf coast onshore areas remain core areas and are more aligned with our long term business strategies
