item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview datascope corp 
is a diversified medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets proprietary products for clinical health care markets in interventional cardiology and radiology  cardiovascular and vascular surgery  anesthesiology  emergency medicine and critical care 
we have four product lines that are aggregated into two reportable segments  cardiac assist monitoring products and interventional vascular products 
we have aggregated our product lines into two segments based on similar manufacturing processes  economic characteristics  distribution channels  regulatory environments and customers 
management evaluates the revenue and profitability performance of each of our product lines to make operating and strategic decisions 
the cardiac assist monitoring products segment accounts for of total sales 
our products are sold worldwide by direct sales representatives and independent distributors 
our largest geographic markets are the united states  europe and japan 
we believe that customers  primarily hospitals and other medical institutions  choose among competing products on the basis of product performance  features  price and service 
in general  we believe price has become an important factor in hospital purchasing decisions because of pressure to cut costs 
these pressures on hospitals result from federal and state regulations that limit reimbursement for services provided to medicare and medicaid patients 
there are also cost containment pressures on healthcare systems outside the united states  particularly in certain european countries 
many companies  some of which are substantially larger than us  are engaged in manufacturing competing products 
our products are generally not affected by economic cycles 
our sales growth depends in part upon the successful development and marketing of new products 
we continue to invest in research and development 
our growth strategy includes selective acquisitions or licensing of products and technologies from other companies 
in june  we acquired artema medical ab  a privately held swedish manufacturer of proprietary gas analyzers  which identify and measure the concentration of anesthetic agents used during surgery 
the acquisition of artema expands our product offerings targeted toward the surgical marketplace 
artema is the developer of the world s most compact and power efficient side stream gas analyzer  the artema aion tm  which is sold on an oem basis to patient monitoring companies 
artema s revenues have grown per year compounded over the past three years 
we intend to maintain artema as a stand alone company serving its oem customers and to incorporate artema s gas bench technology in our patient monitors for use in ors  significantly reducing the cost while enhancing the capabilities of those monitors 
the global market for anesthetic measurement equipment is estimated at million annually 
in january  we purchased a five year license from the sorin group of milan  italy  for exclusive worldwide distribution rights to sorin s peripheral vascular stent products  excluding the united states and japan 
as part of that agreement  we received an option to purchase sorin s worldwide peripheral vascular stent business within two years 
we estimate the worldwide market for peripheral vascular stents and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty pta balloons  excluding the united states and japan  to be million annually 
in january  we acquired the clearglide endoscopic vessel harvesting evh product  from ethicon  a johnson johnson company 
evh devices enable less invasive techniques for the harvesting of suitable vessels for use in coronary artery bypass grafting 
the vessel harvesting product line was integrated into the cardiac assist business  which markets its products to cardiac surgeons who perform coronary bypass graft surgery 
we estimate the potential annual market for evh to be million 
in october  we announced a plan to exit the vascular closure market and phase out the interventional products ip business 
we have engaged an investment bank as financial advisor for the sale of our vascular closure devices  vasoseal  on site tm and x site 
we plan to seek the sale or independent distribution of our prolumen tm thrombectomy device for the interventional radiology market  although these plans are subject to the reversal of a verdict that is being appealed see special items below for a discussion of litigation related to prolumen 
in february  we completed the sale of our proguide tm chronic dialysis catheter and the associated assets for million plus a royalty on future sales of the proguide catheter 

table of contents our safeguard tm assisted pressure device received fda k clearance to claim reduced manual compression time to stop bleeding following femoral arterial catheterization in diagnostic and interventional procedures in march in may  following fda clearance of the new clinical claim  we tripled the safeguard sales and marketing effort in the united states from a pilot sales group to the entire cardiac assist direct sales force 
safeguard is aimed at an estimated million annual worldwide market 
additionally  in fiscal  we recorded a pretax charge of million related to workforce reductions in the patient monitoring division  genisphere  corporate and in the european sales organization 
we are committed to improving our operating margins through increasing the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and cost containment programs 
results of operations financial summary the following table shows the comparison of net earnings and earnings per diluted share over the past three fiscal years 
year ended june  dollars in millions  except per share data net earnings earnings per share  diluted the decrease in net earnings and earnings per diluted share in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to expenses associated with workforce reductions million  the ip exit plan million  increased selling and marketing expenses in the cardiac assist monitoring segment million primarily associated with the introduction of new products  filling open positions and a full year of evh selling expense  lower special dividend income million in fiscal compared to fiscal and a higher tax rate of compared to in fiscal partially offsetting the above was the cost savings from the ip exit plan and the workforce reductions million 
the increase in net earnings and earnings per diluted share in fiscal compared to fiscal was caused principally by higher earnings in the cardiac assist and intervascular businesses  dividend income received of million after tax  or per share from a preferred stock investment  and a gain on sale of an unused facility of million after tax  or per share 
additionally  fiscal included special charges of million after tax or per share as discussed below 
partially offsetting the above was lower earnings in the interventional products and patient monitoring businesses and a charge of million after tax  or per share  related to the postponement of the launch of the x site vascular closure device

table of contents balloon pumps in the united states 
sales of iabs increased principally due to increased volume in international markets 
the new generation cs balloon pump teams up with the new sensation tm fr 
fiber optic balloon catheter to provide higher fidelity blood pressure monitoring while eliminating the need for an additional invasive arterial pressure catheter as required by conventional balloon pump systems 
at fr 
in diameter mm or inch  the sensation is also the world s smallest diameter iab  a highly desirable feature 
these new products underscore datascope s leadership in the worldwide market for counterpulsation therapy 
the sensation product began shipping in june  and therefore made only a modest contribution to the increase in cardiac assist revenues 
patient monitoring sales of patient monitoring products in fiscal were million  a decrease of compared to fiscal  primarily reflecting continued competitive pricing pressure on stand alone patient monitors and lower sales of panorama tm central monitoring wireless systems 
panorama offers wireless medical telemetry service wmts with radio bands reserved for medical use

the artema ipr d was calculated based on the income approach to establish fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to a development project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we used a risk adjusted discount rate of to discount projected cash flows 
r d expense for the cardiac assist monitoring products segment was million in fiscal compared to million last year 
the decrease was primarily due to higher software development costs capitalized for patient monitors this year  which reduced r d expenses compared to the prior year million

although our on site next generation vascular closure device had gained some traction in the market with a relatively small sales force  we were not prepared to accept the current level of expenses of the ip business  nor make the additional investment in distribution needed to move the business ahead more quickly 
we continue to fill customer orders and provide clinical support for our vascular closure devices  vasoseal and on site  while we seek a buyer for the vascular closure products  including x site 
we have engaged an investment bank as financial advisor for the sale of the vascular closure product line and negotiations are ongoing with potential buyers 
we added the safeguard manual assist device to the product portfolio of the entire cardiac assist sales force  beginning may we plan to seek the sale or independent distribution of our prolumen thrombectomy device for the interventional radiology market  although these plans are subject to the reversal of a verdict that is being appealed 

table of contents a competitor has brought an action against us alleging that our prolumen thrombectomy device infringes its intellectual property 
in june  a jury ruled that prolumen does infringe that intellectual property and an award for thousand in royalties and an injunction against the manufacture and sale of that device were entered 
we have appealed this ruling and we believe that we will be successful in that appeal 
accordingly  we have not accrued the royalties awarded nor have we reduced the value at which we carry the prolumen assets on our books 
we have not treated the value of the assets associated with ip to be impaired because we believe that the value of those assets will be recovered in a sale 
we will recognize a gain or loss on the sale of those assets  depending on the amounts that we ultimately realize on their disposition 
the aggregate carrying value of those ip assets is approximately million 
we recorded a pretax charge of million related to the ip exit plan in fiscal  comprising million for severance and other termination benefits  million for purchase commitments and contract termination costs and million for the write off of fixed assets

workforce reductions in the patient monitoring division  the european sales organization  corporate and genisphere in october  we reduced the workforce in the patient monitoring pm division 
all of the terminated employees left the company by the end of fiscal as a consequence  we recorded a pretax charge of million for severance and other termination benefits 
in december  we reduced the workforce in the european sales organization and recorded a charge of million for severance and other termination benefits 
the workforce reductions resulted primarily from the merger of the european pm sales organization into the existing european sales organization  which had previously focused on cardiac assist  ip and intervascular products 
all of the terminated employees left the company by the end of fiscal in february  we reduced the workforce in genisphere 
all of the terminated employees left the company by the end of fiscal as a consequence  we recorded a pretax charge of million for severance and other termination benefits 
in june  we recorded a pretax charge of million for severance  settlement and other termination benefits due to workforce reductions in the corporate legal and internal audit departments as a result of outsourcing these functions 
genisphere goodwill impairment genisphere goodwill was determined to be completely impaired based on the annual goodwill impairment test performed in fiscal slower growth in genisphere s markets primarily attributable to increased competition in the dna microarray market  had a negative impact on genisphere s operating results and resulted in lower growth expectations 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal inquiry expenses in fiscal  we incurred expenses of million related to the audit committee investigations of ethics line reports related to the chairman and chief executive officer and an executive officer in europe 
the ethics line

the audit committee engaged independent counsel and forensic accountants to investigate these charges as disclosed in our k filings  based on the results of the investigations  the audit committee concluded that there was no evidence to support the allegations made in the ethics line reports 
the audit committee  with the assistance of independent counsel and independent forensic accountants  also reviewed the matters raised by the internal audit department and legal department concerning the chairman and found the issues raised by them to be without merit 
the special charges noted above were reflected in the cardiac assist monitoring products segment million  the interventional vascular products segment million and corporate and other million 
fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pretax charge totaling million related to the postponement of the launch of the x site vascular closure device in the united states 
the postponement was the result of market feedback from the limited launch of x site  which revealed a strong market preference for a pre tied knot as an integral part of the device 
the x site product currently provides a suture knot tier as an accessory 
in conjunction with the decision to delay the launch of the x site device  we eliminated positions  or of the workforce in ip at a cost of million for severance and other termination benefits 
in addition  as a result of our decision to redesign the x site device to incorporate a pre tied knot  we wrote off million of existing x site inventory and tooling and recorded a liability of million for purchase commitments and contract termination costs

income taxes in fiscal  the consolidated effective tax rate was compared to last year 
the higher tax rate in fiscal was primarily attributable to the expiration of the extraterritorial income exclusion on december  and a shift in the geographical mix of earnings to higher taxed jurisdictions 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in the us research and development credit 
additionally  the tax rate was lower in fiscal

unfavorable foreign exchange translation reduced sales growth by million 
sales of balloon pumps  principally the cs automatic balloon pump  reflect continued strong international demand and the replacement of older pump models from the large base of installed pumps in the united states 
sales of intra aortic balloons increased due to continued strong international growth 
sales of intra aortic balloons in the united states remained steady with a slight decrease in unit sales being offset by higher average selling prices as a result of increased sales of the higher priced linear tm fr 
balloon 
the clearglide evh product was launched by the cardiac assist division in january  after completion of the acquisition from ethicon  a johnson johnson company 
we estimate that currently approximately of the  coronary bypass procedures now performed in the united states use evh products 
accordingly  we estimate that the total potential annual market for evh is approximately million at full penetration and we expect the clearglide product to make a significant contribution to the future growth of the cardiac assist business 
patient monitoring sales of patient monitoring products increased to million due primarily to increased sales of panorama patient monitoring networks 
panorama was introduced in the first quarter of fiscal  and worldwide installations have grown to more than at the end of fiscal partially offsetting the above were lower average selling prices for bedside monitors in fiscal compared to fiscal reflecting increased competitive pressure in the united states and in certain international markets and unfavorable foreign exchange translation which reduced sales growth by million

information concerning forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of many important factors 
many of these important factors cannot be predicted or quantified and are outside our control  including the risk that the spectrum or monitor will not strengthen the company s competitive position in the million annual worldwide market for operating room monitors and with customers that seek to standardize monitoring in different areas of the hospital with one supplier and that market conditions may change  particularly as the result of competitive activity in the markets served by the company 
additional risks include the company s dependence on certain unaffiliated suppliers including single source manufacturers for patient monitoring  cardiac assist and interventional products  continued demand for the company s products  rapid and significant changes that generally characterize the medical device industry and the ability to continue to respond to such changes and the uncertain timing of regulatory approvals  as well as other risks detailed in documents filed by datascope with the securities and exchange commission 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an on going basis and adjust as necessary to accurately reflect current conditions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on current and historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following are our most critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenue and all related costs  including warranty costs  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss passes to the customer and collectibility of the fixed sales price is probable 
for products shipped fob shipping point  revenue is recognized when they leave our premises 
for products shipped fob destination  revenue is recognized when they reach the customer 
for certain products where we maintain consigned inventory at customer locations  revenue is recognized when the product has been used by the customer 
we record estimated sales returns as a reduction of net sales in the same period that the related revenue is recognized 
historical experience is used to estimate an accrual for future returns relating to recorded sales  as well as estimated warranty costs 
revenue for service repairs of equipment is recognized after service has been completed  and service contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
for certain products  revenue is recognized separately for delivered components when the delivered components have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered components and the undelivered components are not essential to the functionality of the delivered components 
we do not have a general right of return for our products 
post shipment obligations for training commitments are considered perfunctory  and sales are recognized when delivered with provision for incremental costs 
we reflect shipping and handling fees as revenue and shipping and handling costs as cost of sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is used to report trade receivables at their estimated net realizable value 
we rely on prior experience to estimate cash which ultimately will be collected from the gross receivables balance at period end 
such amount cannot be known with certainty at the financial statement date 
we maintain a specific allowance for customer accounts that will likely not be collectible due to customer liquidity issues 
we also maintain an allowance for estimated future collection losses on existing receivables  determined based on historical trends 
inventory valuation we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
inventory is recorded at its estimated fair market value based upon our historical experience with inventory becoming obsolete due to age  changes in technology and other factors 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the current tax expense as well as assessing temporary differences in the treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess whether it will be more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and or the implementation of tax planning strategies 
to the extent that we cannot conclude that recovery is likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
we have not recorded us deferred income taxes on certain of our non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings  because such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the united states indefinitely 
our repatriation of million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of was deemed to be distributed entirely from foreign earnings that had previously been treated as indefinitely reinvested 
however  this distribution from previously indefinitely reinvested earnings does not change our position going forward that future earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested 

table of contents we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of those jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  including challenges regarding the timing and amount of deductions and credits and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
our us income tax returns for fiscal and prior years have been audited by the internal revenue service and are closed 
the us statutory period has expired for fiscal years though  and is open for subsequent periods 
during fiscal  we have closed audits in several state jurisdictions with immaterial adjustments 
statutory periods remain open in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions 
we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances  including existing tax laws and the status of current examinations 
although we have recorded all probable income tax accruals in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  our accruals represent accounting estimates that are subject to inherent uncertainties associated with the tax audit process  and therefore include certain contingencies 
we believe that our accrual for income tax liabilities  including related interest  is adequate in relation to the potential for additional tax assessments 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a significant impact on our tax provision  net income and cash flows 
pension plan actuarial assumptions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in the united states and certain european countries covering eligible employees 
we use several actuarial and other statistical factors which attempt to estimate the ultimate expense and liability related to our pension plans 
these factors include assumptions about discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases 
in addition  subjective assumptions  such as withdrawal and mortality rates are utilized 
the actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to the changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences  depending on their magnitude  could have a significant impact on the amount of pension expense we record in any particular period 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement creates a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions which utilizes a two step approach for evaluating such tax positions 
recognition step one occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step two is only addressed if step one has been satisfied 
in addition  expanded disclosures are required 
we will adopt fin in our fiscal year beginning july  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in addition  sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy to be used to classify the source of information used in fair value measurements  new disclosures of assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on their level in the hierarchy and a modification of the long standing accounting presumption that the transaction price of an asset or liability equals its initial fair value 
sfas is effective in fiscal years beginning after november  effective for our fiscal year beginning july  
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
on june   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas  an amendment of sfas   and r 
sfas requires registrants to fully recognize an asset or liability for the overfunded or the underfunded status of their benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheet 
the pension asset or liability equals the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and its benefit obligation 
the benefit obligation is measured as the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and as the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement benefit plans 
at june   we had a pbo that was approximately million higher than the fair value of the 
table of contents us and international defined benefit pension plan assets 
the serp plans had a pbo of approximately million at june  there are no assets in the serp plans 
in addition  we are required to recognize as part of other comprehensive income loss  net of taxes  gains and losses due to differences between our actuarial assumptions and actual experience actuarial gains and losses and any effects on prior service due to plan amendments prior service costs or credits that arise during the period and which are not yet recognized as net periodic benefit costs 
at adoption date  we recognized million within accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax  related to the previously unrecognized net actuarial losses  prior service credits and net transition amounts 
we currently meet the sfas requirement that the measurement date for plan assets and liabilities must coincide with the sponsor s year end 
sfas also includes additional disclosures in an entity s annual financial statements 
see note for additional information related to our retirement benefit plans 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab requires registrants to use both a balance sheet approach and an income statement approach when quantifying and evaluating the materiality of a misstatement and to adjust the financial statements if either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material 
sab also contains guidance on correcting errors under the dual approach and provides transition guidance for correcting errors existing in prior years 
if prior year errors that had been previously considered immaterial based on the appropriate use of the registrant s prior approach now are considered material based on the approach in sab  the registrant need not restate prior period financial statements 
during the second quarter we identified a prior year misstatement that we considered to be immaterial under our current approach for evaluating the materiality of a misstatement 
however  upon adoption of sab this misstatement was considered material to the financial statements and was corrected upon adoption during the fourth quarter through a cumulative effect adjustment impacting beginning retained earnings and cumulative translation adjustments as of the beginning of fiscal the misstatement relates to a cumulative translation adjustment of approximately million that was not written off in fiscal when a european subsidiary was closed as part of a restructuring 
this adjustment did not have an impact on total consolidated stockholders equity 
in november  the fasb issued emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefits aspects of collateral assignment split dollar life insurance arrangements  which is effective for fiscal years that begin after december  our fiscal year beginning july  
the task force concluded that an employer should recognize a liability for the postretirement benefit related to a collateral assignment split dollar life insurance arrangement in accordance with either fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  or accounting principles board opinion no 
 omnibus opinion  based on the substantive agreement with the employee 
the task force also concluded that an employer should recognize and measure an asset based on the nature and substance of the collateral assignment split dollar life insurance arrangement 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement provides an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
in addition  sfas establishes presentation and disclosure requirements for those assets and liabilities which the registrant has chosen to measure at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  our fiscal year beginning july  
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize net earnings volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions which are primarily related to certain intercompany receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
our hedging activities do not subject us to exchange rate risk because gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the intercompany receivables hedged 
the net gains or losses on these 
table of contents foreign currency forward exchange contracts are included within other  net  in our consolidated statements of earnings 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
none of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are designated as economic hedges of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
as a result  no foreign currency transaction gains or losses were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the years ended june   and as of june   we had a notional amount of million of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  all of which were in euros and british pounds 
the foreign exchange forward contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed months and require us to exchange foreign currencies for united states dollars at maturity  at rates agreed to when the contract is signed
