item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment and risk factors management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained within this report  including the notes thereto 
our future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors that are beyond our control 
these include the factors set forth in risk factors and forward looking statements 
accordingly  past results and trends may not be reliable indicators of future results or trends 
with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed below include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we caution readers that a number of important factors discussed in this report could affect our actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
overview we are a financial holding company offering a broad range of community banking and financial services through locations in kansas  missouri  nebraska and colorado through our wholly owned banking subsidiaries  teambank and colorado national bank 
our presence in kansas consists of seven locations in the kansas city metropolitan area and three locations in southeast kansas 
we operate two locations in western missouri  three in metropolitan omaha  nebraska  and three in the colorado springs  colorado metropolitan area 
in  we plan to open two new locations  one in falcon  colorado and one in lee s summit  missouri 
our total assets over the past ten years have grown from million at january  to million at december  the growth in assets and the corresponding increase in earnings were achieved primarily through purchases of branches of large banks  purchases of community banks  and branch expansions 
our branch expansion includes growth at existing branches  primarily through the addition of loan officers at those locations  as well as the opening of new branches 
accompanying the acquisition growth were increased operating expenses as well as increases in provisions for loan losses and amortization expense of intangible assets related to acquisitions  and in some instances  issuance of our common stock in conjunction with the acquisitions 
our experience is that it takes to months to realize meaningful net income improvements from acquisitions due to our emphasis on retaining key employees rather than the immediate implementation of cost reduction measures 
at december  total assets were million  an increase of million  or  from million at december  the increase in total assets was primarily due to an increase in loans receivable of million 
the increase in loans was offset by a decrease in investment securities of million 
at december  total assets were million  an increase of million  or  from million at december  the increase in total assets during was primarily due to an increase in loans receivable of million offset by a decrease in assets of discontinued operations of million 
net income from continuing operations totaled million for the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  the decrease of  or  was primarily the result of an increase in net interest income of million  or  offset by a decrease in non interest income of  or  and an increase in non interest expense of million  or 
the million increase in non interest expense was largely due to an  charge relating to the restructuring of the trust preferred securities

on february   we sold our interest in the insurance agency subsidiary 
financial information as of and for the years ended december   and presents the assets  liabilities and operating results of this subsidiary in discontinued operations 
as a result of the sale  the operations related to the insurance agency subsidiary have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
for the year ended december   discontinued operations resulted in a net loss of  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  during the second quarter of  a loss on the sale of the insurance agency subsidiary of approximately  was recorded upon finalization of the selling price and is presented  net of the tax effect  in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the sale was effective december  and  therefore  the operations of the insurance subsidiary during were assumed by the new owners 
pursuant to the notice provisions of the agreement  the buyer presented its breach of warranty and representation claims in august   and in february  filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of oklahoma against team financial  inc  teambank  na asset corporation  mystic capital advisors group  llc  robert j 
weatherbie  michael l 
gibson and kevin donoghue 
the complaint asserts claims for breach of contract  negligent misrepresentation  fraud and misrepresentation and civil conspiracy in connection with the sale of the insurance agency subsidiary that was sold to the buyer  effective december  the company believes the claims are without merit  and it will pursue a vigorous defense as well as pursue available counterclaims against the plaintiff 
see our discussion under discontinued operations and litigation for further information 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements and related notes  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the statement of financial condition and revenues and expenses for the period presented 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
allowance for loan losses one of our critical accounting policies relates to the allowance for loan losses and involves significant management valuation judgments 
we perform periodic and systematic detailed reviews considering historical loss experience  the volume and type of lending conducted  the status of past due principal and interest payments  an evaluation of economic conditions  particularly as such conditions relate to our market areas  and other factors related to the collectibility of our loan portfolio 
based upon these factors  management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectibility of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for probable loan losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans if their ultimate collectibility is considered questionable 
since certain lending activities involve greater risks  the percentage applied to specific loan types may vary 
the allowance provided is subject to review by our regulators 
management believes that the allowance is adequate for probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
though management uses available information to provide appropriate allowances for inherent losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on borrowers circumstances and changes in economic conditions 
impairment of goodwill analysis the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  require that goodwill be evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if conditions indicate impairment may have occurred 
the evaluation of possible impairment of intangible assets involves judgment based upon short term and long term projections of future performance 
the company has completed its most recent evaluation of goodwill of continuing operations and determined that no impairment exists for the year ended december  there was no impairment of goodwill in net loss from discontinued operations included an impairment of goodwill of  during the year ended december  as a result of the annual impairment testing and the sale of the insurance agency 
deferred income taxes the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns related to deferred income 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
analysis of the results of operations net interest income from continuing operations our income is derived primarily from net interest income  which is the difference between interest income  principally from loans  investment securities  federal funds sold  and interest bearing deposits  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and other borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume and interest rates earned and expensed 
volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following tables set forth the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities associated with continuing operations  as well as the amount of interest income or interest expense from continuing operations and the average rate for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a tax equivalent basis assuming a tax rate for the periods indicated

non accruing loans are included in the computation of average balances 
interest income includes loan fees 
these fees for the years ended december    and were   and  respectively 
yield is adjusted for the tax effect of tax exempt securities 
the tax effects for the years ended december    and were   and  respectively 
net interest margin increased to for the year ended december  compared to and for the years ended and  respectively 
the increase in net interest margin resulted from higher average rates earned on interest earning assets than average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  largely due to an increase in the yield on loans receivable 
total interest income on a tax equivalent basis from continuing operations for was million  representing an increase of million  or  from million for the increase was primarily the result of an million increase in interest income on loans receivable 
interest income on loans receivable increased due to a basis point increase in the average yield on loans receivable to in from in  coupled with an increase of million in the average loan receivable balance to million in from million in the increase in the yield of loans receivable reflects the increase in the rates applied to loans that re priced in as required by the notes terms and the pricing of newly originated loans at higher rates 
the average yield on taxable investment securities increased basis points from in to in  contributing to an thousand increase in interest income 
offsetting the increase in interest income due to higher yields was a decrease in average balances of approximately million  resulting in a decrease in interest income of approximately thousand 
the net decrease in interest income as a result of the higher average yield and lower average balance was thousand 
cash flow from the reduction of investment securities was redirected to fund loan growth 
total interest expense from continuing operations was million for  a million  or a increase from million in the increase was primarily related to the increase in average rates paid on time deposits to in from in  representing a basis point increase 
branch cd promotions contributed the majority of the increase in average balances and the corresponding increase in rates paid on those deposits 
the average rates paid on interest bearing savings and checking deposits increased basis points from in to in as a result of the changes described above  net interest income on a tax equivalent basis from continuing operations increased to million during  representing an increase of million  or  compared to million in interest income on loans receivable increased due to a basis point increase in the average yield on the loans receivable to in from in  coupled with an increase of million in the average loan receivable balance to million in from million in the increase in the yield of loans receivable reflects the increase in the rates applied to loans that re priced in as required by the notes terms and the pricing of newly originated loans at higher rates 
the average yield on taxable investment securities increased basis points from in to in  contributing to a thousand increase in interest income 
offsetting the increase in interest income due to higher yields was a decrease in average balances of approximately million  resulting in a decrease in interest income of approximately thousand 
however  the net decrease in interest income as a result of the higher average yield and lower average balance was thousand 
total interest expense from continuing operations was million for  a million  or  increase from million in the increase was primarily related to the increase in average rates paid on time deposits to in from in  representing a basis point increase 
an increase of approximately million in the average balances of time deposits as a result of branch cd promotions also contributed to a thousand increase in interest expense 
additionally  the average rates paid on interest bearing savings and checking deposits increased from in to in  an increase of basis points 
as a result of the changes described above  net interest income on a tax equivalent basis from continuing operations increased to million during  representing an increase of million  or  compared to million in the average rate paid on our subordinated debentures  which we restructured in september  was for compared to for pursuant to the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no

the following table presents the components of changes in our net interest income from continuing operations  on a tax equivalent basis  attributed to volume and rate 
changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to volume changes are calculated by multiplying the change in volume by the prior fiscal year s average interest rate 
the changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to changes in interest rates are calculated by multiplying the change in interest rate by the prior fiscal year s average volume 
the changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to the combined impact of changes in volume and change in interest rate are calculated by multiplying the change in rate by the change in volume

provision for loan losses a provision for losses on loans represents management s determination of the amount necessary to be charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered appropriate by management based on historical loss experience  the volume and type of lending conducted  the status of past due principal and interest payments  general economic conditions  particularly as such conditions relate to our market areas  and other factors related to the collectibility of our loan portfolio 
it is management s practice to review the allowance on a monthly basis to determine the level of provision to be recognized in the allowance  and after considering the above factors  management recorded a provision for loan losses on loans totaling million for the year ended  million for the year ended  and million for the year ended the increase in the provision recorded in compared to was primarily a result of increased loan balances in compared to though loan balances increased proportionately more than the provision in  and non performing loans also increased  additional loan loss allowances were deemed not necessary because the additional non performing credits are well secured 
the provision recorded for the year ended decreased from primarily as a result of the increased levels of loans secured by real estate which are secured by higher collateral values  therefore  not necessitating large amounts of loan loss reserves 
non interest income from continuing operations the following table sets forth non interest income from continuing operations for the indicated periods 
years ended december in thousands service charges trust fees brokerage service revenue gain on sales of mortgage loans loss on sales of investment securities mortgage servicing fees  net of amortization merchant processing fees atm and debit card fees income from investment in bank owned life insurance other total non interest income non interest income from continuing operations was million for  a million  or  decrease from this decrease was primarily a result of a decrease of gain on sales of mortgage loans resulting in a million  or  decrease in compared to the continued decrease in gain on sales of mortgage loans was the result of the steady decrease in volume of loans refinanced and originated and sold due to the stabilizing interest rate environment and higher rates than in previous years 
we do not expect gain on sales of mortgage loans to increase materially unless interest rates decrease significantly 
further decreases in gain on sales of mortgage loans could occur in the event that long term interest rates increase 
service charges decreased approximately  for the year ended compared to the year ended due to decreased volume of overdraft fees and decreased service charges  primarily due to the loss of one large retail account  however  this loss also lowered the associated processing costs 
the company incurred  loss on the sales of investment securities during  due to decisions to restructure certain investments maintained in our portfolio in order to achieve higher yields in the future 
non interest income from continuing operations decreased thousand during to million  compared to million during the decrease was primarily the result of a thousand  or decrease in gain on sales of mortgage loans as a result of the decrease in volume of loans refinanced and originated and sold due to the continued decline in mortgage banking activity as a result of the higher interest rate environment as compared to the interest rate environment of prior years 
also contributing to the decrease was a thousand  or  decrease in merchant processing fees from thousand in to thousand in the decrease in merchant processing fees was a result of selling our merchant processing portfolio in the fourth quarter of since the sale of the portfolio  all merchant processing fee income is a result of a referral program with the vendor

r  share based payments  sfas no 
r in january stock based compensation expense increased  during compared to  largely due to the adoption of this accounting standard 
occupancy and equipment increased approximately  during primarily due to increased building and equipment maintenance and repair costs and a  write down of the value of one of our buildings that will be sold 
the largest contribution to the increase in non interest expense was the  charge taken as a result of the restructuring of the trust preferred securities 
see note subordinated debentures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the restructuring of the trust preferred securities and the related charge 
non interest expense from continuing operations was million for the year ended  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended salaries and employee benefits increased  or  over primarily due to an increase in bonuses earned in of approximately  as compared to data processing expense increased approximately  due to increases in computer license expense and other computer support 
additionally  professional fees increased  or  primarily due to increased internal audit expenses 
these increases were offset by a decrease in intangible asset amortization of  or  primarily due to a reduction of the valuation allowance on mortgage servicing rights based on our valuation of the fair value of the mortgage servicing assets

loans secured by real estate loans secured by real estate represent our largest loan category 
at december  these loans totaled million  a million  or  an increase from million at december  the increase was generated from a million  or increase in construction and land development loans and a million increase in commercial real estate loans

we occasionally retain the servicing rights on these loans

the balance of our mortgage servicing rights was  at december  compared to  at december  non farm  non residential commercial loans secured by real estate increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  we have experienced steady growth in this area over the last five years 
we anticipate continued growth in this loan portfolio with our continued emphasis on small to mid size business loans in our metropolitan markets

loan maturities the following tables present  at december  and  loans by maturity in each major category of our portfolio based on contractual schedules 
actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are re evaluated using substantially the same credit procedures that are used when loans are made

non performing loans consist of loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest  non accrual loans  and restructured loans 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest is days or more past due  or when  in the opinion of management  a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectibility of interest  regardless of the delinquency status of a loan  the accrual of interest income is typically discontinued and any interest accrued to date is reversed through a charge to interest income  unless the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
while a loan is on non accrual status  it is our policy that interest income is recognized only after payment in full of the past due principal 
however  in some instances  we will collect interest on a cash basis for loans that are on non accrual and recognize interest income when there is no doubt  in the opinion of management  that the interest and principal will be collected in full based on the collateral values and management s analysis of the collectibility of the loan 
the following table presents information concerning the non performing assets at the dates indicated 
december dollars in thousands non accrual loans loans days past due and still accruing restructured loans non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets non performing loans as a percentage of total loans non performing assets as a percentage of total assets total non performing assets were million at december  compared to million at december   representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in non performing assets was due to an increase in non accrual loans of million and an increase in other real estate owned of  loans days past due and still accruing decreased  largely as a result of one relationship with an industrial distribution company for  that has since become current in non performing loans increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase in non performing loans was a result of an increase in non accrual loans of million 
this increase was primarily due to a group of loans in our missouri market from a diversified commercial customer totaling million being on non accrual status 
the loans were placed on non accrual status during the fourth quarter of based on their delinquent status 
the loans are well secured with real estate currently valued at million 
these loans were placed on non accrual status during the fourth quarter of based on their delinquent status 
to avoid foreclosure  the borrower agreed to make monthly payments on million of these loans 
the borrower has made the required monthly payments  and the interest payments were recorded on a cash basis to interest income 
subsequent to december   the borrower paid off approximately million of the impaired loans 
currently  all loans with this customer are in good standing 
also included in non accrual loans is an agriculture loan for approximately  which is fsa guaranteed  so our exposure is only of the loan 
also included in the million of non accrual loans at december  were several small loan relationships  the largest of which was approximately  to an engineering company and subsequent to december   has been resolved 
non accrual loans had approximately  specific reserves included in the allowance for loan losses at december  we do not anticipate losses on these credits in excess of the specific reserves 
restructured loans at december  consisted of ten relationships 
the largest relationship included an agricultural loan restructured through farmer home administration of approximately  in addition to the non accrual loans mentioned above  the company also has identified loans for which management has concerns about the ability of the borrowers to meet existing repayment terms 
these loans are primarily classified as substandard for regulatory purposes under the company s internal rating system 
the loans are generally secured by either real estate or other borrower assets  reducing the potential for loss should they become non performing 
although these loans are generally identified as potential problem loans  they may never become non performing 
such loans totaled million at december  other real estate owned was  at december  compared to  at december  other real estate owned consisted of eight properties  consisting of three commercial buildings  three single family dwellings and two vacant lots at december  the properties are all located within our market areas 
management is working to sell the real estate as soon as practicable 
during the year ended december   eleven properties held in other real estate owned were sold at a total net gain of approximately  non performing assets as a percent of total assets were at december   compared to at december   and at december  non performing assets will generally increase in times of economic uncertainty or stress 
management believes the level of non performing assets may increase if economic weaknesses are experienced in  although the magnitude of any increase in non performing loans is not determinable 
impaired loans we consider a loan to be impaired when it is deemed probable by management that we will be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest payments in accordance with the terms of the original loan agreement 
however  when determining whether a loan is impaired  management also considers the loan documentation  the current ratio of the loan s balance to collateral value  and the borrower s present financial position 
included as impaired loans are all loans contractually delinquent days or more  all loans upon which accrual of interest has been suspended  all restructured loans  and all loans for which management has significant doubts as to the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest 
at december   we had impaired loans totaling million  which have related specific reserves of million 
this compares to million of impaired loans  which had related specific reserves of million at december  the increase in impaired loans was the result of the increase in non accrual loans described above 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans was million during and million during interest income recognized on impaired loans during the period the loans were considered to be impaired for and approximated  and  respectively 
impaired loans will generally increase in times of economic uncertainty or stress 
management believes the level of impaired loans could increase if economic weaknesses are experienced in our market area during allowance for loan losses credit losses are inherent in the lending business 
the risk of loss will vary with general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and the quality of the collateral of the loan 
management maintains our allowance for loan losses based on historical experience  an evaluation of economic conditions and regular review of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality 
based upon these factors  management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectibility of the loan portfolio and maintains an allowance for probable loan losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans if their ultimate collectibility is considered questionable 
since certain lending activities involve greater risks  the percentage applied to specific loan types may vary 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
we actively manage our past due and non performing loans in an effort to minimize credit losses and monitor asset quality to maintain an adequate loan loss allowance 
although management believes our allowance for loan losses is adequate  there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover future loan losses 
further  although management uses the most current information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used or adverse developments arise with respect to non performing or performing loans 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that our allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover loan losses or that significant increases to the allowance will not be required in the future if economic conditions should worsen 
material additions to the allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease of our net income and capital and could result in an inability to pay dividends  among other adverse consequences 
the following table sets forth information regarding changes in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated

lending personnel are responsible for continuous monitoring of the loan portfolio 
additionally we have a separate loan review process  which reviews the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine compliance with loan policy  including the appropriateness of risk ratings assigned to individual loans  as well as the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is based primarily on management s estimates of probable loan losses from the foregoing processes and historical experience 
the following table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category as of the dates indicated 
the allocation table should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts  by loan classification  to be charged to the allowance 
the table has been derived in part by applying historical loan loss ratios to both internally classified loans and the portfolio as a whole to determine the allocation of the loan losses attributable to each category of loans

the company relies on quarterly economic trend reports for the kansas city metropolitan market and the colorado springs metropolitan market 
the allowance for loan losses allocated to construction and land development increased approximately  at december  compared to december  due to an increase in the allocation of the allowance associated with historical trends and economic for our market conditions coupled with an increased balance in this category in compared to the allowance for loan losses allocated to commercial and other loans secured by real estate decreased  due to the decreases in the allowance required based on historical and economic trends for our market compared to the prior year 
the allowance for loan losses allocated to commercial and agricultural loans increased approximately  due to an increase in specific reserves of  offset by a decrease in historic and economic reserves allocated to commercial and agriculture loans at compared to investments we invest a portion of our available funds in short term and long term instruments  including federal funds sold and investment securities 
our investment portfolio is designed to provide liquidity for cash flow requirements  to assist in managing interest rate risk  and to provide collateral for certain public deposits and other borrowing arrangements 
at december  and  the investment portfolio was comprised principally of mortgage backed securities  obligations of us government agencies and obligations of states and political subdivisions 
total investment securities at december  of million represented a decrease of million from total investment securities of million at december  the decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in the securities of government sponsored entities of million  the proceeds of which were used to fund the loan portfolio growth 
we initiated a long term balance sheet management strategy starting in the fourth quarter of to increase the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet with the expectation of benefiting from an anticipated increase in interest rates and to borrow long term borrowings during the period of historically low interest rates 
under this strategy we borrowed million in federal home loan advances and purchased short term investment securities and funded loans 
the federal home loan bank borrowings  which carry an average rate of  upon origination consisted of million in year fixed rate advances convertible to floating rate advances if libor increases to a range of to within the years  million in year fixed rate advances convertible to floating rate advances if libor increases to within the years  million in year floating rate advances and million in year fixed rate advances 
as of december   we had outstanding balances of million on these federal home loan bank borrowings 
a decreasing interest rate environment may cause an unfavorable impact on net interest income and net interest margin and an increasing interest rate environment may increase net interest income and net interest margin over the remaining borrowing period

deposits are attracted principally from within our primary market areas through the offering of a broad variety of deposit instruments for individual and corporate customers 
at december   total deposits totaled million  a million  or increase from million at december  the increase was a result of an increase in certificates of deposits of million  primarily due to branch promotional campaigns and an increase in public funds in the fourth quarter of in addition to the deposits raised through our branches  we also obtained million in brokered cd s in order to meet funding requirements

federal home loan bank and federal reserve bank borrowings our subsidiary banks are members of the federal home loan bank of topeka fhlb 
the fhlb system functions as a central bank providing credit for members 
as members of the fhlb  our subsidiary banks are entitled to borrow funds from the fhlb and are required to own fhlb stock in an amount determined by a formula based upon total assets and fhlb borrowings 
our subsidiary banks may use fhlb borrowings to supplement deposits as a source of funds 
at december   fhlb borrowings aggregated million  compared to million at december  and million at december  as discussed in the investment section above  approximately million of the fhlb borrowings are part of a long term balance sheet strategy to increase the sensitivity of our balance sheet by borrowing long term funds at historically low interest rates and purchasing short term investments securities and fund loans 
at december   the aggregate available and unused borrowing capacity of our subsidiary banks was approximately million  which was available through a line of credit and term advances 
fhlb borrowings are collateralized by fhlb common stock  investment securities and certain qualifying mortgage loans of our subsidiary banks 
teambank and colorado national bank are member banks of the federal reserve bank and may use the federal reserve bank discount window to meet short term funding needs 
neither of our subsidiary banks utilized short term federal reserve bank borrowings during or subordinated debentures on august   team financial capital trust i the trust  a delaware business trust formed by team financial  inc  completed the sale of million cumulative trust preferred securities 
the trust used the net proceeds from the offering to purchase a like amount of team financial  inc s subordinated debentures 
the debentures  maturing august   were the sole assets of the trust 
on or after august   we had the right to redeem the debentures  in whole or in part  at a redemption price specified in the governing indentures plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date 
on september   we redeemed all of the debentures and the trust redeemed its trust preferred securities  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the trust  or million  plus interest accrued and unpaid through september  as a result of the redemption  we incurred a pretax charge  recorded as trust preferred securities redemption amortization to earnings of approximately  on the redemption date of the debentures 
this charge was the unamortized portion of the offering cost that was being amortized over the original year life of the debentures 
to fund the redemption  on september  we replaced the prior existing debentures and the former trust with team financial capital trust ii  a pooled trust preferred security of million at a variable rate of above the day libor 
the new trust preferred securities have a year term maturing on october  and a call option years after the issuance date 
the new trust preferred securities did not have a placement or annual trustee fee associated with it 
we expect to save approximately  annually based on the reduction in interest rates at the time of restructuring 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  adopted in december  the new trust qualifies as a special purpose entity that is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements 
the million trust preferred securities issued by the trust in september are reported on the records of the new trust 
we continue to include the new trust preferred securities issued by team financial capital trust ii in tier i capital for regulatory capital purposes 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have various contractual obligations in the normal course of business that are integral to our operations 
the following table summarizes payments due per these contractual obligations at december  payments due by one year or less over one to three years over three to five years over five years total in thousands time deposits repurchase agreements subordinated debentures fhlb advances and notes payable operating lease obligations loan commitments data processing contracts total payments on time deposits are based on contractual maturity dates 
these funds may be withdrawn prior to maturity with or without penalties 
included in subordinated debentures and notes payable in the above table is subordinated debt of  the debentures mature on october  and have a callable option five years after the issuance date 
these debentures are included in the three to five year maturity category in the table above based on the date of earliest redemption 
operating lease obligations represent property rented for branch offices 
payments represent the minimum lease payments and exclude related costs such as utilities 
loan commitments represent obligations to provide financing to our customers 
as some of these commitments will expire prior to funding the full amount  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash obligations 
data processing contracts represent the minimum obligations under these contracts and exclude additional payments that are based on volume of transactions processed 
additionally  we offer standby letters of credit to our customers  which are a conditional  but irrevocable form of guarantee  issued to guarantee payment upon default of payment by our customer 
standby letters of credit are initially issued for a period of one year  but can be extended depending on customer needs 
the contractual amount of standby letters of credit was  at december  and the maximum remaining term for any standby letter of credit is january  however  we have several standby letters of credit that are backed by demand notes that automatically renew and have no stated maturity 
commitments for standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
capital resources we actively monitor compliance with bank and financial holding company regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on risk based guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent upon the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet  and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  such as commitments to extend credit  in addition to the level of capital 
included in the risk based capital method are two measures of capital adequacy  core capital and total capital  which consist of core and secondary capital 
historically  we have increased core capital through retention of earnings or capital infusions 
the primary source of funds available to us is dividends by our subsidiary banks 
each subsidiary bank s ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory requirements 
core capital  also known as tier capital  generally includes common shareholders equity  perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill and intangible assets 
no more than of core capital elements may consist of cumulative preferred stock 
the trust preferred securities  issued by our subsidiary  team financial capital trust ii  to purchase team financial  inc subordinated debentures  is included in tier i capital of team financial  inc for regulatory purposes 
total risk based capital  also known as tier capital  generally includes the allowance for loan losses limited to of weighted risk assets  certain forms of perpetual preferred stock  as well as hybrid capital instruments

impact of inflation and changes in prices the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increasing operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than do changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rate changes do not necessarily move in the same direction  or have the same magnitude  as changes in the prices of goods and services 
recent accounting pronouncements in december of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payments  sfas r 
this statement requires that the cost resulting from all share based transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
sfas r establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payments with employees except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans 
sfas r replaces fasb statement no

r using the modified prospective transition method and  accordingly  previously reported amounts have not been restated for the change in accounting 
the company adopted sfas r effective january  prior to fiscal year  the company accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb  and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
more information regarding the adoption of sfas r is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with fasb statement no 
accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with this interpretation is a two step process 
the first step is a recognition process to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and the company will begin applying the guidance in january  the adoption of fin will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements  which provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab requires an entity to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet perspective iron curtain approach and income statement perspective rollover approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors 
prior year misstatements must be considered in quantifying misstatements in current year consolidated financial statements and if the effect of those misstatements is material to the current year  the prior year consolidated financial statements must be corrected even though such revision previously was and continues to be immaterial to the periods in which they originated 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its analysis under both the rollover and iron curtain approaches and adopted sab  and in accordance with its provisions 
the company recorded a  cumulative increase  net of tax of  to retained earnings as of january  the net impact of the adoption of sab was material to the company and resulted in an increase in book value per share as of this date 
the company does not believe any of the amounts described below are material to the periods in which they originated using the rollover approach

the issue requires an employer to recognize a liability for future benefits payable to its employees under these agreements 
the effects of applying this issue must be recognized through either a change in accounting principle through an adjustment to equity or through the retrospective application to all prior periods 
for calendar year companies  the issue is effective beginning january  the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this interpretation on its financial position  results of operations  and liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity we continuously forecast and manage our liquidity in order to satisfy cash flow requirements of depositors  borrowers  and our own cash flow needs 
we have developed internal and external sources of liquidity to meet our continued growth needs 
these liquidity sources include  but are not limited to  raising deposits through branch promotional campaigns  purchasing brokered certificates of deposits  overnight funds  short term investment securities classified as available for sale and drawing on credit facilities established through the federal home loan bank of topeka and other lines of credit established through us bank 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale 
the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating  financing  lending  and investing activities during any given period 
at december  and december   these liquid assets totaled million and million  respectively 
included in these liquid assets are investment securities of million at december  and million at december  that were pledged as collateral for borrowings  repurchase agreements and for public funds on deposit 
at december  there was approximately million borrowing capacity remaining under agreements with the federal home loan bank of topeka 
during  our loan portfolio increased approximately 
decreased liquidity may result in the inability to continue this growth rate in the future or may result in an increased cost of funding 
deposit growth through branch promotional campaigns is expected to provide the primary source of funding for our loan growth  however  the use of brokered certificates of deposits is another source of additional funding should we need the funds 
management believes our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet expected cash needs for the foreseeable future 
asset and liability management asset and liability management refers to management s efforts to minimize fluctuations in net interest income caused by interest rate changes 
this is accomplished by managing the re pricing of interest rate sensitive interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
controlling the maturity of re pricing of an institution s liabilities and assets in order to minimize interest rate risk is commonly referred to as gap management 
close matching of re pricing assets and liabilities will normally result in little change in net interest income when interest rates change 
we monitor our asset and liability mix monthly in an effort to maintain consistent earnings performance through the control of interest rate risk 
below is a static gap schedule as of december  this is just one of several tools which may be used to measure and manage interest rate sensitivity 
interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are presented below within selected time intervals based on their re pricing and maturity characteristics 
in this presentation  the sensitivity position would be perfectly matched when an equal amount of assets and liabilities re price during any given time period 
excess assets or liabilities re pricing in a given time period results in the interest rate gap shown in the table 
a positive gap indicates more assets than liabilities will re price in that time period  while a negative gap indicates more liabilities than assets will re price 
static gap analysis at december  months or less through months through months through months through months more than months total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable  net of unearned income investment securities federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits other assets total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities savings deposits and interest bearing checking time deposits under  time deposits over  federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase federal home loan bank advances notes payable and subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities periodic repricing gap cumulative repricing gap periodic repricing gap as a percent of interest earning assets cumulative repricing gap as a percent of interest earning assets the table indicates that we are asset sensitive in the through month period  the through month period  and more than months  and are liability sensitive for all other periods 
the liability sensitivity during the three months or less period is primarily due to the classification of savings and interest bearing checking as three months or less as these funds may be withdrawn at any time 
this means that during the first period classification  interest bearing liabilities re price faster than interest earning assets  thereby improving net interest income when rates are falling and reducing net interest income when rates are rising 
while the static gap method is a widely used measure of interest sensitivity  it is not  in management s opinion  the only indicator of our interest rate sensitivity 
the following table indicates that at december   if there had been a sudden and sustained increase in prevailing market interest rates  our net interest income would be expected to increase  while a decrease in rates would indicate a decrease in net interest income 
net interest decrease percent change in interest rates income increase change dollars in thousands basis point rise basis point rise base rate scenario basis point decline basis point decline we believe we are appropriately positioned for future interest rate movements  although we may experience fluctuations in net interest income due to short term timing differences between the re pricing of assets and liabilities
