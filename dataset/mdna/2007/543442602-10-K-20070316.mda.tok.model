critical accounting policies and estimates our financial condition and results of operations are based upon certain critical accounting policies  which include estimates  assumptions  and judgments on the part of management 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the following discussion highlights those policies and the underlying estimates and assumptions  which we consider critical to an understanding of the financial information in this report 
revenue recognition online advertising our online advertising revenue is primarily composed of per click fees that we charge customers 
customers set the per click fee charged for inclusion targeted listings when their account is established 
the per click fee charged for keyword targeted listings is calculated based on the results of online bidding on keywords or page content  up to a maximum cost per keyword or page content set by the customer 
revenue also captures impression based revenue from banner advertisements  as well as revenue share from licensing of private labeled versions of our products 
revenues associated with online advertising products  including advertiser solutions  findarticles  our other consumer sites  and banner advertisements are generally recognized once collectibility is established  delivery of services has occurred  all performance obligations have been satisfied  and no refund obligations exist 
we pay distribution network partners based on clicks on the advertiser s ads that are displayed on the websites of these distribution network partners 
these payments are called traffic acquisition costs and are included in cost of revenues 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf  the revenue derived from these arrangements that involve traffic supplied by distribution network partners is reported gross of the payment to the distribution network partners 
this revenue is reported gross due to the fact that we are the primary obligor to the advertisers who are the customers of the advertising service 
affiliate revenue is included in online advertising revenue and is based on commissions received for participation in affiliate programs 
affiliate programs are programs operated by affiliate network services or 
table of contents online merchants  in which merchants pay traffic providers on a cost per acquisition basis 
by participating in affiliate programs  we generate revenue when internet consumers make a purchase from a participating merchant s website after clicking on the merchant s listing in our search results 
revenues from affiliates are earned on a per sale basis or as a percentage of sales rather than a per click basis 
revenue is recognized in the period in which a merchant finalizes a sale and reports to us via our affiliate network 
we also enter into agreements to provide private labeled versions of our products  including the adcenter for publishers 
these arrangements include multiple elements  primarily revenue sharing based on the publishers customers monthly revenue generated through the adcenter application  as well as upfront fees  and license fees 
we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  and financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
we recognize upfront fees over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance  license fees over the term of the license  and revenue sharing portions over the period in which such revenue is earned 
in all cases  revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed  and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we provide a provision against revenue for estimated reductions resulting from billing adjustments and customer refunds 
the amounts of these provisions are evaluated periodically based upon customer experience and historical trends 
deferred revenue is recorded when payments are received in advance of performance in underlying agreements 
customer deposits are recorded when customers make prepayments for online advertising 
licensing revenues associated with our former licensing agreement with microsoft were recognized in the period in which urls were added to the database and the database was delivered to microsoft 
we did not recognize any license revenue related to microsoft in and allowance for doubtful accounts determination of collectibility of payments requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes performing initial and ongoing credit evaluations of customers 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
this valuation allowance is reviewed on a periodic basis to determine whether a provision or reversal is required 
the review is based on factors including the application of historical collection rates to current receivables 
we will record a reduction of our allowance for doubtful accounts if there is a significant improvement in collection rates or economic conditions are more favorable than we anticipated 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than we anticipated or for customer specific circumstances  such as bankruptcy 
management s judgment is required in the periodic review of whether a provision or reversal is warranted 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we have recorded goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions 
management exercises judgment in the assessment of the related useful lives  fair value and recoverability of these assets 
the majority of intangible assets are amortized over three to seven years  the period of expected benefit 
goodwill is not amortized 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we periodically re assess the valuation and asset lives of intangible assets to conform to changes in management s estimates of future performance 
management considers existing and anticipated competitive and economic conditions in such assessments 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at 
table of contents least annually and as a result of any event that significantly changes our business 
the company uses market capitalization  as well as cash flow forecasts and other market value indicators to review goodwill for impairment 
cash flow forecasts used in evaluation of goodwill are based on trends of historical performance and management s estimate of future performance 
deferred taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if we operate at a loss or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets which could substantially increase our effective tax rate for such period 
alternatively  if our future taxable income is significantly higher than expected and or we are able to utilize our tax credits  we may be required to reverse all or a significant part of our valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets which could substantially reduce our effective tax rate for such period 
therefore  any significant changes in statutory tax rates or the amount of our valuation allowance could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our reported financial results 
internal use software development costs we account for internal use software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
in accordance with the capitalization criteria of sop  we have capitalized external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing and obtaining internal use computer software and the payroll and payroll related costs of employees who devote time to the internal use computer software project 
management s judgment is required in determining the point at which various projects enter the stages at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs  and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized 
we expect to continue to invest in internally developed software and to capitalize costs in accordance with sop restructuring charges we have recorded a restructuring accrual related to closing certain leased facilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal of activities sfas 
management s judgment is required when estimating when the redundant facilities will be subleased and at what rate they will be subleased 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which revised sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires all share based payment transactions with employees  including grants of employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan to be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period based on their relative fair values 
sfas r is a new and very complex accounting standard  the application of which requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding black scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives  as well as expected option forfeiture rates  to value equity based compensation 
sfas r 
table of contents requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in net income loss 
in connection with the adoption of sfas r  stock based compensation expense of approximately million was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  associated with the fair value and initial vesting of employee stock options granted and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan during the period 
there was no cumulative effect of adoption

revenues from advertiser solutions increased in by approximately million  primarily as a result of increased volume of total paid clicks  million in as compared million in in  average rpc declined to per click  from per click for the decline in average rpc is primarily due to an increase in low rpc advertisers during  as compared to  as a result of the introduction of a 
table of contents new run of site advertising product during q in  we began removing low converting traffic from our distribution network 
during this time  our rpc decreased as advertisers were less willing to pay our previous rates for low quality traffic 
in q we launched the adcenter for publishers  which is the primary source of our revenues from our publisher solutions  which contributed to the approximately million increase in revenues during revenues from our consumer sites are driven by our findarticles product 
in  revenues from our consumer sites increased to million from million in this increase was primarily due to revised strategic positioning of our advertisement banners  as well as our text advertisements through third party ad serving 
in  online advertising revenue primarily decreased as compared to  as a result of the elimination of low converting traffic as we continued our efforts to improve traffic quality and optimize traffic flow from our distribution network partners 
further  revenues also decreased due to the winding down of our distribution network partner agreement with microsoft  which began in january of this decrease was partially offset by a increase in revenue from the sale of our consumer products  driven by our findarticles product 
in  we improved our content  which subsequently increased page view and findarticles revenue 
we also began generating revenue from our adcenter for publishers agreements during the second half of  which further offset the overall decrease in revenue 
prior to we exclusively licensed our database content to microsoft and customized it for their use 
revenues from this agreement were thousand for and have been included in total revenues for reporting purposes

table of contents other costs of revenues consist of connectivity costs  personnel costs of our operations employees including share based compensation  equipment depreciation  expenses relating to hosting advertising operations  commissions paid to advertising agencies and amortization of intangible assets

traffic acquisition costs  the costs paid to our distribution network partners  decreased in compared to  which coincides with our decrease in advertiser solutions revenues 
these costs increased as a percentage of advertiser solutions revenue as we began paying a slightly higher revenue sharing percentage to our distribution network partners for higher converting traffic 
in  other costs of revenues included content costs 
in  the increase in content costs  as compared to  was due to an increase in fees related to one of our findarticles content providers 
in  other costs were relatively consistent as compared to we expect gross margin to remain at approximately to throughout as improvements in revenue mix are expected to be offset by slightly higher tac levels throughout operating expenses operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  product development  general and administrative  restructuring charges and share based compensation

software licensing and computer equipment depreciation related to supporting product development functions are also included in product development expenses 
capitalized software development costs include the costs to develop software for internal use  excluding costs associated with research and development  training and testing 
during compared to  the increase in capitalized software development costs was due to more work on the new version of the adcenter implemented during may in addition  we developed projects to further enhance other core assets  such as furl and vertical search technologies  associated with our network of owned and operated consumer sites 
the adoption of sfas r also partially contributed to the increase in capitalized software costs 
the decrease in other product development expenses during compared to primarily relates to the decrease in depreciation and amortization of approximately million due to end of life for certain fixed assets  as well as lower facilities cost allocations of approximately thousand 
facilities costs declined in due to an increase in acquisition of sub tenants to offset rent expense 
this is partially offset by an increase in temporary staffing costs to meet requirements of current development efforts 
during compared to  the increase in capitalized development costs was due to projects related to developing our vertical sites and our proprietary software platform for tracking and invoicing clicks  totaling approximately million 
offsetting the increase in capitalized costs from to was a write down of previously capitalized software of approximately million during the third quarter of these increases in compared to were partially outweighed by an approximate million write down in of software costs previously capitalized for projects that were cancelled in the second quarter of these projects were canceled because they were not aligned with our future operating plan

year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  cash flows used in operating activities cash flows provided by used in investing activities cash flows provided by financing activities our primary source of cash is receipts from revenues 
the primary uses of cash are labor costs salaries  benefits  and other employee compensation  general operating expenses office rent  utilities  insurance and supplies  payments to distribution network partners related to traffic acquisition and content costs associated with our consumer sites  and professional services fees related to legal and audit costs

managed service accounts represented less than of revenues at the beginning of  and more than of revenues by the end of during  net cash used in operations increased million from a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in was the primary reason for the increase

table of contents while we expect cash to decrease in  we believe that our working capital will provide adequate liquidity to fund our operations and meet other cash requirements for at least the next months 
we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings in order to fund our operations and capital expenditures  take advantage of favorable business opportunities  develop and upgrade our technology infrastructure  develop new product and service offerings  take advantage of favorable conditions in capital markets or respond to competitive pressures 
in addition  unanticipated developments in the short term  such as the entry into agreements requiring large cash payments or the acquisition of businesses with negative cash flows  may necessitate additional financing 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt 
additionally  we are not a party to any derivative contracts or synthetic leases 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we incur various contractual obligations and commercial commitments in our normal course of business 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands total less than year years years thereafter note obligation principal and interest operating leases purchase obligations total indemnification during the normal course of business  we have made certain guarantees  indemnities and commitments under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these indemnities include intellectual property and other indemnities to our customers and distribution network partners in connection with the sales of our products  and indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease 
further  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving  at our request  in such capacity  to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of delaware 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
however  we maintain directors and officers insurance coverage that may contribute  up to certain limits  a portion of any future amounts paid for indemnification of directors and officers 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
historically  we have not incurred any losses or recorded any liabilities related to performance under these types of indemnities 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for interest rate changes relates primarily to our cash equivalents  short term and long term investments 
we had no derivative financial instruments as of december  or we invest our excess cash in debt and equity instruments of high quality corporate issuers with original maturities greater than three months and effective maturities less than two years 
the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument is limited 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and vary in value as market interest rates fluctuate 
during the year ended december   the effects of changes in interest rates on the fair market value of our marketable investment securities and our earnings were not material 
further  we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our securities and our earnings from a hypothetical change in interest rates would not be significant 
foreign currency risk international revenues from our foreign subsidiaries were   and of total revenues in   and  respectively  and were derived from our australian  british and japanese operations 
such revenues have been classified as discontinued operations 
our international business was subject to risks typical of an international business  including but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility  particularly the exchange rates between the australian dollar  the british pound  the japanese yen and the united states dollar 
in the first quarter of  we signed agreements to sell the assets and activities of our international subsidiaries and are in the process of liquidating all of our international entities 
as of december   our exposure to foreign currency risk was not significant
