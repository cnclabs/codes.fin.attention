critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities

if assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the company  additional write downs of inventories may be required

actual amounts could be different from those estimated

in addition  the company assesses the following factors broad economic factors impacting the investee s industry  publicly available forecasts for sales and earnings growth for the industry and investee  and the cyclical nature of the investee s industry

the fair value hedges and the hedged debt are adjusted to current market values through interest expense 
the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative designated as a net investment hedge is recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment  which is included in the shareholders equity section  and any ineffective portion would be recorded in earnings

 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which used a fair value based method of accounting for sbp awards 

table of contents the company adopted the modified prospective transition method provided for under statement no 
r and  accordingly  has not restated prior period amounts 
the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model and the assumptions shown in note the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sbp awards represent management s best estimates 
the company s estimates may be impacted by certain variables including  but not limited to  stock price volatility  employee stock option exercise behaviors  additional stock option grants  estimates of forfeitures  and related tax impacts

the costs and obligations of the company s defined benefit pension plan are dependent on actuarial assumptions 
the two critical assumptions used  which impact the net periodic pension cost income and the benefit obligation  are the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
the discount rate represents the market rate for a high quality corporate bond  and the expected return on plan assets is based on current and expected asset allocations  historical trends  and expected returns on plan assets 
these key assumptions are evaluated annually 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts 
the company performs an annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist  to evaluate goodwill 
goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  the company reviews both quantitative and qualitative factors to support its assumptions with regard to fair value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a weighted average multiple of earnings before interest and taxes from comparable companies 
in determining the fair value  the company makes certain judgments  including the identification of reporting units and the selection of comparable companies 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy and or market conditions  the company may be required to record an impairment charge 
shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of products sold or selling  general and administrative expenses

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company  as a large global organization  faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on the company s financial results in the future 
the company s primary exposure relates to transactions in which the currency collected from customers is different from the currency utilized to purchase the product sold in europe  the asia pacific region  canada  and latin america 
the company s policy is to hedge substantially all such currency exposures for which natural hedges do not exist 
natural hedges exist when purchases and sales within a specific country are both denominated in the same currency and  therefore  no exposure exists to hedge with a foreign exchange forward  option  or swap contracts collectively  the foreign exchange contracts 
in many regions in asia  for example  sales and purchases are primarily denominated in us dollars  resulting in a natural hedge 
natural hedges exist in most countries in which the company operates  although the percentage of natural offsets  as compared with offsets  which need to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts  will vary from country to country 
the company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
the risk of loss on a foreign exchange contract is the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties  which the company minimizes by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions 
the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts is estimated using market quotes 
the notional amount of the foreign exchange contracts at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the carrying amounts  which are nominal  approximated fair value at december  and the translation of the financial statements of the non united states operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the increase in consolidated sales and operating income was impacted by the translation of the company s international financial statements into us dollars  which resulted in increased sales of million and increased operating income of million for  compared with the year earlier periods  based on sales at the average rate for sales and operating income would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  if average foreign exchange rates had declined by against the us dollar in this amount was determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical foreign exchange rate on the sales and operating income of the company s international operations 
in may  the company entered into a cross currency swap  which has a maturity date of july  for approximately million or million the cross currency swap to hedge a portion of its net investment in euro denominated net assets and which has been designated as a net investment hedge 
the cross currency swap will also effectively convert the interest expense on million of long term debt from us dollars to euros 
based on the foreign exchange rate at december   the company would expect reduced interest expense of approximately 
million for the period from january through july date that interest will reset 
as the notional amount of the cross currency swap is expected to equal a comparable amount of hedged net assets  no material ineffectiveness is expected 
the cross currency swap had a negative fair value of million at december  in october  the company entered into a cross currency swap  which has a maturity date of october  for approximately million or million the cross currency swap to hedge a portion of its net investment in euro denominated net assets and which has been designated as a net investment hedge 
the cross currency swap will also effectively convert the interest expense on million of long term debt from us dollars to euros 
based on the foreign exchange rate at december   the company would expect reduced interest expense of approximately million for the period from october through april date that interest will reset 
as the notional amount of the cross currency swap is expected to equal a comparable amount of hedged net assets  no material ineffectiveness is expected 
the cross currency swap had a negative fair value of million and a fair value of 
million at december  and  respectively 
interest rate risk the company s interest expense  in part  is sensitive to the general level of interest rates in north america  europe  and the asia pacific region 
the company historically has managed its exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and floating rate debt in its total debt portfolio 
additionally  the company also utilizes interest rate swaps in order to manage its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt 

table of contents at december   approximately of the company s debt was subject to fixed rates  and of its debt was subject to floating rates 
a one percentage point change in average interest rates would not have had a material impact on interest expense  net of interest income  in this was determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical interest rate on the company s average floating rate on investments and outstanding debt 
this analysis does not consider the effect of the level of overall economic activity that could exist 
in the event of a change in the level of economic activity  which may adversely impact interest rates  the company could likely take actions to further mitigate any potential negative exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that might be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
in june  the company entered into a series of interest rate swaps  with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the swaps modify the company s interest rate exposure by effectively converting the fixed senior notes to a floating rate  based on the six month us dollar libor plus a spread an effective rate of and at december  and  respectively  and a portion of the fixed senior notes to a floating rate  also based on the six month us dollar libor plus a spread an effective rate of and at december  and  respectively  through their maturities 
the swaps are classified as fair value hedges and had a negative fair value of million and a fair value of 
million at december  and  respectively 
in november  the company entered into a series of interest rate swaps  with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the swaps modify the company s interest rate exposure by effectively converting the fixed senior notes to a floating rate  based on the six month us dollar libor plus a spread an effective rate of and at december  and  respectively  through their maturities 
the swaps are classified as fair value hedges and had a negative fair value of 
million and million at december  and  respectively 
the swaps related to the senior notes were terminated in january upon the repayment of the senior notes
