our objective is to be the leader in mobile computing 
we intend to achieve this objective by providing our customers and end users with high quality innovative products  services and support that are easy to use 
management periodically reviews certain key business metrics in order to evaluate our strategy and operational efficiency  allocate resources and maximize the financial performance of our business 
these key business metrics include the following revenue management reviews many elements to understand our revenue stream 
these elements include supply availability  unit shipments  average selling prices and channel inventory levels 
revenue growth is impacted by increased unit shipments and variations in average selling prices 
unit shipments are determined by supply availability  timing of carrier certification  end user and channel demand  and channel inventory 
we monitor average selling prices throughout the product life cycle  taking into account market demand and competition 
to avoid empty shelves at retail store locations and to minimize product returns and obsolescence  we strive to maintain channel inventory levels within a desired range 
margins we review gross margin in conjunction with revenues to maximize operating performance 
we strive to improve our gross margin through disciplined cost and product life cycle management  supply demand management and control of our warranty and technical support costs 
to achieve desired operating margins  we also monitor our operating expenses closely to keep them in line with our projected revenue 

table of contents cash flows we strive to convert operating results to cash 
to that effect  we carefully manage our working capital requirements through balancing accounts receivable and inventory with accounts payable 
we monitor our cash balances to maintain cash available to support our operating  investing and financing requirements 
we believe the mobile computing solutions market dynamics are generally favorable to us 
the high speed wireless networks which enable true always on connectivity are fueling the growth of the market for smartphone devices 
with our computing heritage  we are able to work closely with carriers to deploy advanced wireless data applications that take advantage of their wireless data networks 
while the market for handheld computers is maturing  our leadership position and our ability to develop and deliver high quality products enable us to produce solid operating performance from this product line 
our handheld computing device product line also provides a brand and scale that can be leveraged across our entire product portfolio 
we expect to experience annual revenue growth of our smartphone product line 
the smartphone market is emerging and people are beginning to understand the personal and professional benefits of being able to access email or browse the web on a smartphone 
we expect this market to expand and we expect to capitalize on this expansion 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in palm s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  these estimates and judgments are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in our balance sheets and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each of our fiscal periods are affected by estimates and assumptions which are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for rebates  price protection  product returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty and technical service costs  royalty obligations  goodwill and intangible asset impairments  restructurings  inventory  stock based compensation and income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are significantly affected by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
revenue is recognized when earned in accordance with applicable accounting standards and guidance  including staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  and aicpa statement of position  or sop  no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
we recognize revenues from sales of mobile computing devices under the terms of the customer agreement upon transfer of title to the customer  net of estimated returns  provided that the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
for our web sales distributors  we recognize revenue based on a sell through method utilizing information provided by the distributor 
sales to resellers are subject to agreements allowing for limited rights of return and price protection 
accordingly  revenue is reduced for our estimates of liability related to these rights 
the estimate for returns is recorded at the time the related sale is recognized and is adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns and other related factors 
the reserves for rebates and price protection are recorded at the time these programs are offered in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  and are estimated based on specific programs  expected usage and historical experience 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue from software arrangements with end users of our devices is recognized upon delivery of the software  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
for 
table of contents arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method 
when all of the undelivered elements are software related  this allocation is based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of the undelivered items 
vsoe is based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately  but is expected to be sold in the marketplace within six months of the initial determination of the price by management 
when the undelivered elements include non software related items  this allocation is based on objective and reliable evidence of fair value  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we defer the portion of the arrangement fee equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements until they are delivered 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and an assessment of international  political and economic risk as well as the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there is a change in a major customer s creditworthiness or actual defaults differ from our historical experience  our actual results could differ from our estimates of recoverability 
we accrue for warranty costs based on historical rates of repair as a percentage of shipment levels and the expected repair cost per unit  service policies and our experience with products in production or distribution 
if we experience claims or significant changes in costs of services  such as third party vendor charges  materials or freight  which could be higher or lower than our historical experience  our cost of revenues could differ from our estimates 
palm accrues for royalty obligations to other technology and patent holders based on unit shipments of its smartphone and handheld computer devices  as a percentage of applicable revenue for the net sales of products using certain software technologies or as a fully paid up license fee  all as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreements 
where agreements are not finalized  accrued royalty obligations represent management s current best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections based on negotiations with third party licensors 
palm has accrued royalty obligations of million and million as of may  and  respectively  including estimated royalties of million and million  respectively  which are reported in other accrued liabilities 
fiscal year includes a benefit of approximately million as a result of negotiating more favorable licensing terms than were expected as of may  while the amounts ultimately agreed upon may be more or less than the current accrual  management does not believe that finalization of the agreements would have had a material impact on the amounts reported for its financial position as of may  or for the reported results for the year then ended  however  the effect of finalization in the future may be significant to the period in which recorded 
long lived assets such as land held for sale  and property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not ultimately be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its ultimate disposition 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  as required under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment by applying a fair value based test at the reporting unit level within our single reporting segment 
a goodwill impairment loss would be recorded for any goodwill that is determined to be impaired 
under sfas no 
 accounting for the disposal of long lived assets  intangible assets are evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be impaired 
an impairment loss would be recognized for an intangible asset to the extent that the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value  which is determined based upon the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset  including disposition 
cash flow estimates used in evaluating for impairment represent management s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at the time 
effective for calendar year  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which supersedes eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for costs to exit an 
table of contents activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  we record liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities when the liability is incurred 
prior to calendar year  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 we accrued for restructuring costs when we made a commitment to a firm exit plan that specifically identified all significant actions to be taken 
we record initial restructuring charges based on assumptions and related estimates that we deem appropriate for the economic environment at the time these estimates are made 
we reassess restructuring accruals on a quarterly basis to reflect changes in the costs of the restructuring activities  and we record new restructuring accruals as liabilities are incurred 
inventory purchases and purchase commitments are based upon forecasts of future demand 
we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost which approximates first in  first out cost or market 
if we believe that demand no longer allows us to sell our inventory above cost or at all  then we write down that inventory to market or write off excess inventory levels 
if customer demand subsequently differs from our forecasts  requirements for inventory write offs could differ from our estimates 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we adopted the provisions of  and account for stock based compensation in accordance with  sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we elected the modified prospective method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we currently use the black scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  expected risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on historical time from vesting until exercise 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock based upon the implied volatility derived from the historical market prices of our traded options with similar terms 
our decision to use this measure of volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that this measure of volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than is historical volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate for option valuation on constant maturity rates provided by the us treasury with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
our deferred tax assets represent the tax effects of net operating loss nol carryforwards  of tax credit carryforwards and of temporary differences that will result in deductible amounts in future years if we have taxable income 
a valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value  based on estimates and certain tax planning strategies 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the net carrying value 
the valuation allowance is reviewed quarterly and is maintained until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowance based upon current and preceding 
table of contents years results of operations and anticipated profit levels in future years 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets resulting in additional provision to income tax expense 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company determined  based on current and preceding years results of operations and anticipated profit levels in future periods  that it is more likely than not that its domestic deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and  accordingly  that it was appropriate to release the valuation allowance recorded against those deferred tax assets 
in reaching this conclusion  the company weighed both negative and positive evidence regarding the realizability of these deferred tax assets and considered the extent to which the evidence could be objectively verified 
although the company has determined that a valuation allowance is no longer required with respect to its domestic net operating loss carryforwards  deferred expenses and tax credit carryforwards  recovery is dependent on achieving the forecast of future operating income over a protracted period of time 
as of may   the company would require approximately million in cumulative future operating income to be generated at various times over approximately the next years to realize the net deferred tax assets 
based upon the company s historical results for the most recent fiscal year  it would take the company less than years to utilize its current nol and tax credit carryforwards 
the company will review its forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on an ongoing basis 
our key critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

table of contents results of operation comparison of fiscal years ended may  and revenues years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands revenues we derive our revenues from sales of our smartphone and handheld computers  add ons and accessories 
revenues for fiscal year decreased approximately from fiscal year smartphone revenue was billion in fiscal year and increased from billion in fiscal year handheld revenue was million in fiscal year and decreased from million in fiscal year during fiscal year  net device units shipped were approximately  units at an average selling price of per unit 
during fiscal year  net device units shipped were approximately  units at an average selling price of per unit 
of this decrease in revenues  net unit shipments and accessories sales decreased approximately percentage points offset by an increase in average selling prices contributing approximately percentage points 
the decrease in net unit shipments is due to a decrease in handheld unit sales of approximately year over year  partially offset by the increase in higher volume of smartphone unit sales of approximately year over year 
this increase of smartphone unit sales reflects an increase of smartphone sell through of year over year 
the increase in average selling price reflects a continued shift towards smartphones during fiscal year  which carry a higher average selling price 
in addition  average selling price was affected by a greater mix of recently introduced products at higher average selling prices 
we expect our handheld business to continue to decline in fiscal year international revenues were approximately of worldwide revenues in fiscal year  compared with approximately in fiscal year international revenues increased by percentage point compared to a decrease in united states revenues of percentage points  resulting in a decrease in worldwide revenues for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year average selling prices for our devices increased in the united states and internationally by and  respectively  during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase in average selling prices in the united states is primarily the result of a greater mix of recently introduced products at higher average selling prices 
the increase in the average selling price internationally is primarily the result of a shift towards smartphones  which carry a higher average selling price 
net units sold decreased approximately in the united states and decreased approximately internationally 
the decrease in net unit sales in the united states and internationally is primarily the result of a decline in unit sales of our handheld computers which was partially offset by an increase in smartphone unit sales 
total cost of revenues years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands cost of revenues applicable portion of amortization of intangible assets total cost of revenues total cost of revenues is comprised of cost of revenues and the applicable portion of amortization of intangible assets as shown in the table above 
cost of revenues principally consists of material and 
table of contents transformation costs to manufacture our products  operating system  or os  and other royalty expenses  warranty and technical support costs  freight  scrap and rework costs  the cost of excess or obsolete inventory  and manufacturing overhead which includes manufacturing personnel related costs  depreciation  and allocated information technology and facilities costs 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased by percentage points to for fiscal year from for fiscal year the decrease is primarily the result of approximately percentage points of lower product costs related to a shift in product mix 
in addition  we experienced a percentage point decrease in warranty expenses due to lower per unit repair costs in the current year as compared to the same period a year ago 
we also experienced a percentage point decrease in os royalty rates primarily because the quarterly amortization costs of the new access license agreement entered into in december is less than the per unit royalty costs under the original agreement 
excess and obsolete inventory costs also decreased by percentage points due to a reduction in our provision for end of life products in the current year as compared to the comparable period a year ago 
in addition  we experienced reduced manufacturing spending rates during fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  contributing approximately percentage points  as a result of reduced depreciation costs as older equipment has become fully depreciated 
the amortization of intangible assets applicable to the cost of revenues decreased in absolute dollars during fiscal year compared to fiscal year  due to the intangible assets acquired in the handspring acquisition becoming fully amortized in fiscal year sales and marketing years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist principally of advertising and marketing programs  salaries and benefits for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel expenses and allocated information technology and facilities costs

the second quarter of fiscal year restructuring actions consisted of workforce reductions for approximately regular employees  primarily in europe 
restructuring charges were a result of the company s effort to focus its international sales force on smartphone products 
cash payments of approximately million were made related to these workforce reductions as of may  cost reduction actions initiated in the second quarter of fiscal year are complete 
we cannot assure you that our estimates of the costs associated with the restructuring action taken in connection with the handspring acquisition will not change due to changes in underlying lease and sublease arrangements

based upon the company s results for the most recent fiscal year  it would take the company less than years to utilize its current nol and tax credit carryforwards 
during this period the company s profits have also grown  which  if projected into the future  would result in utilization of current nol and tax credit carryforwards in an even shorter number of years 
the company will review its forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on an ongoing basis 
the trends include the expected continued growth of the smartphone market 
failure by the company to achieve its future operating income targets or negative changes to expected trends may change the assessment regarding the recoverability of the net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of the deferred tax assets 
any increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense and could have a significant impact on our earnings in future periods

during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company determined  based on current and preceding years results of operations and anticipated profit levels in future periods  that it is more likely than not that its domestic deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and  accordingly  that it was appropriate to release the valuation allowance recorded against those deferred tax assets 
in reaching this conclusion  the company weighed both negative and positive evidence regarding the realizability of these deferred tax assets and considered the extent to which the evidence could be objectively verified 
the primary factors considered by the company during the second quarter of fiscal year were that the company had cumulative profits before income taxes of million for the three year period ended with the second quarter of fiscal year  excluding the effects in fiscal year of discontinued operations and the write down of the land held for sale 
since the company spun off palmsource and acquired handspring in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company was profitable in eight of nine quarters and had experienced cumulative profits before income taxes of million 
in addition  the company also considered the following factors based upon the company s recent results of operations  as well as its internal projections  the company expects to utilize its nol carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards prior to their expiration over approximately the next years 
the company has never had any expired operating loss carryovers in its history  and after utilization of net operating losses against the fiscal year federal taxable income  the first federal nol carryforward scheduled to expire is in the year although the company operates in an industry which is competitive and experiences rapid technological change  we have operated successfully in this environment

net accounts receivable was million at may  and may  days sales outstanding  or dso  of receivables was days at may  and during the fiscal year  the cash conversion cycle decreased days to days compared to day at fiscal year end primarily due to average annualized increases in accounts payable offset by decreases in cost of revenues year over year 
the cash conversion cycle is the duration between the purchase of inventories and services and the collection of the cash for the sale of our products and is a quarterly metric on which we have focused as we continue to try to efficiently manage our assets

such purchase commitments typically cover our forecasted product and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from to days 
in certain instances  these agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and or adjust our requirements based on our business needs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we currently maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of cash equivalents and short term investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the objectives of our investment activities are to maintain the safety of principal  assure sufficient liquidity and achieve appropriate returns 
this is accomplished by investing in marketable investment grade securities and by limiting exposure to any one issuance or issuer 
we do not use derivative financial investments in our investment portfolio 
our cash equivalents are primarily money market funds and an immediate and uniform increase in market interest rates of basis points from levels at may  would cause an immaterial decline in the fair value of our cash equivalents 
as of may   we had short term investments of million 
our investment portfolio primarily consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of greater than three months  and of marketable equity securities 
these available for sale investments  consisting primarily of auction rate securities  including government  domestic and foreign corporate debt securities and marketable equity securities  are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
an immediate and uniform increase in market interest rates of basis points from levels at may  would cause a decline of less than  or million  in the fair market value of our short term investment portfolio 
we would expect our operating results or cash flows to be similarly affected by such a change in market interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk we denominate our sales to certain international customers in the euro  in pounds sterling  in brazilian real and in swiss francs 
expenses and other transactions are also incurred in a variety of currencies 
we hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign currency exchange rates by using foreign exchange forward contracts 
gains and losses on the contracts are intended to offset foreign exchange gains or losses from the revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity 
our foreign exchange forward contracts generally mature within days 
we do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
movements in currency exchange rates could cause variability in our revenues  expenses or interest and other income expense 
our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding on may  had a notional contract value in us dollars of approximately million which settled within days 
equity price risk as of may  we do not own any material equity investments 
therefore  we do not currently have any material direct equity price risk
