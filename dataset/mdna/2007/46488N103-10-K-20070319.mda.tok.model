item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a biotechnology company focused on developing emergent  novel skin and tissue rejuvenation products for application in certain aesthetic and therapeutic markets 
our clinical development product candidates are designed to improve the appearance of skin damaged by the normal effects of aging  sun damage  acne and burns with a patient s own autologous fibroblast cells produced in our proprietary isolagen process 
we are also exploring opportunities to expand our pipeline of product candidates and products and to generate operating revenue through the creation of joint marketing and development arrangements  and the license and or acquisition of products and technologies that complement our existing clinical pipeline and are aligned with our business strategy 
we sometimes refer to our product candidates in the aggregate as isolagen therapy 
from through  we made isolagen therapy available to physicians primarily in the united kingdom 
in the fourth quarter of our board of directors approved closing our uk operation 
we have refocused our management and capital resources on building our business in the united states 
as our operations mature in the united states we expect to enter foreign markets when business opportunities that are consistent with our business strategy present themselves 
we believe our cash resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least months from december  we are focused on research and development  are incurring losses from operations  have limited capital resources  and do not have access to a line of credit or other debt facility 
we will need additional capital to execute our business strategy  and if we are unsuccessful in raising such additional capital we may be unable to fully execute our business strategy on a timely basis  if at all 
if we raise additional capital through the issuance of debt securities  the interests of our stockholders would be subordinated to the interests of our debt holders and any interest payments would reduce the amount of cash available to operate and grow our business 
if we raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities  the ownership of our current stockholders would be diluted 
additionally  we do not know whether any financing  if obtained  will be adequate to meet our capital needs and to support our growth 
if adequate capital cannot be obtained on satisfactory terms  we may terminate or delay regulatory approval of one or more of our product candidates  curtail or delay the implementation of manufacturing process improvements or delay the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities 
if we terminate or delay regulatory approval  curtail or delay manufacturing improvements or delay the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities  our business may fail 
we market and sell an advanced skin care line through our majority owned subsidiary  agera  which we acquired in august agera offers a complete line of skincare systems based on a wide array of proprietary formulations  trademarks and nano peptide technology 
these technologically advanced skincare products can be packaged to offer anti aging  anti pigmentary and acne treatment systems 
agera markets its product in both the united states and europe primarily the united kingdom 
we are in the process of re branding agera and its product line  and we expect to commence implementation of its new marketing plans during we are considered to be a development stage enterprise 
recent developments closing of the uk operation in the fourth quarter of  the board of directors approved the closure of our uk operation 
during  we continued to generate negative gross margins from our uk operation  as discussed under results of operations comparison of years ending december  and the uk operation was located in london  england with a manufacturing site in the park royal area and an administrative site in hammersmith  london business district 
both sites are leased 
the manufacturing site lease expires february and  as of december   the remaining lease obligations approximated million 
the administrative site lease expires april and  as of december   remaining lease obligations approximated million 
as of december   the uk operation employed approximately employees  substantially all of which have been or will be terminated during the first quarter of during fiscal we recorded charges of million related to the closure of the uk operation  which were comprised of million for the impairment of assets and million for statutory severance costs 
as of december   there was approximately million of property and equipment  net  remaining on the consolidated balance sheet for the assets at the united kingdom operation 
we believe that the amount of the additional charges associated with this decision  such as the related lease exit costs and professional fees  among other items  cannot be precisely estimated at this time 
however  such charges are expected to be no more than approximately million both before and after tax  excluding the non cash charge of approximately million for property and equipment discussed above  excluding normal operating costs through the date of close and excluding potential claims or contingencies unknown at this time 
lease exit costs will be recorded when we terminate the leases 
as a result  remaining charges will likely be reflected over more than one quarter in future periods  with the majority of all costs estimated to be incurred by the fourth quarter of no assurances can be given with respect to the total cost of closing the uk operation or the timing of such costs 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of closing our uk operation during the first half of  we expect revenue from our uk operation for both the three months ended march  and for the year ended december  to be less than million 
clinical development programs for a discussion of our clinical program please refer to item of part i of this annual report 
acquisition of agera on august   we acquired of the outstanding common shares of agera  a skincare company that has proprietary rights to an advanced line of skincare products 
we paid million in cash to acquire the interest in agera  and in connection with the acquisition contributed  to agera s working capital 
included in the purchase price was an option to acquire an additional of agera s outstanding common shares for an exercise price of million in cash 
this option expired unexercised during february in addition  the acquisition agreement includes future contingent payments up to a maximum of million 
the additional purchase price is based upon certain percentages of agera s cost of sales incurred after june  accordingly  based upon the financial performance of agera  up to an additional million of purchase price may be due the selling shareholder in future periods 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
switzerland in april  we acquired land and a two building   square foot corporate campus in bevaix  canton of neuch tel  switzerland for million  and spent approximately million on the first phase of a renovation 
during april  management decided to place the corporate campus on the market for sale in order to conserve capital 
during  we recorded a charge of approximately million to reduce the carrying amount of the swiss campus to its net realizable value  which charge is reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the net book value of the corporate campus at december  was million  reflecting management s estimate of the realizable value of the corporate campus 
this estimate may change in future periods 
the carrying amount of the campus is presented as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet 
see assets held for sale in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
houston  texas on march   our board of directors approved the closing of the houston  texas facility 
the houston  texas facility was used primarily for research and development purposes and was maintained under an operating lease which ends on april  an exit plan was communicated to the affected employees during the three months ended june  there were approximately employees at the houston  texas facility at march  and the large majority of these employees had been terminated by june  at a severance cost of less than million 
we have subleased approximately of the facility to an unrelated third party and we will use our best efforts to sublease the remaining portion of the facility  however  there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful 
as of december   the remaining lease payments and common operating expenses due under the houston  texas lease agreement were approximately million  or million net of the sublease 
stockholder rights plan in may  our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan  pursuant to a rights agreement dated as of may  pursuant to the rights agreement  stockholders of record at the close of business on may  received one right for each share of isolagen common stock held on that date 
the rights  which will initially trade with the common stock and represent the right to purchase one ten thousandth of a share of our newly created series c preferred stock at per right  become exercisable when a person or group acquires or more of our common stock in the case of certain institutional stockholders or announces a tender offer for or more of the common stock 
in that event  in lieu of purchasing the series c preferred stock  the rights permit our stockholders  other than the acquiror  to purchase isolagen common stock having a market value of twice the exercise price of the rights 
in addition  in the event of certain business combinations  the rights permit holders to purchase common stock of the acquiror at a discount 
rights held by the acquiror will become null and void in each case 
the rights have certain anti takeover effects  in that they would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire a significant interest in us or on terms not approved by the board of directors 
in the event that the board of directors determines a transaction to be in the best interests of us and our stockholders  the board of directors will be entitled to redeem the rights for 
per right at any time before the tenth business day after an announcement that a person or group has acquired ownership of or the tenth business day after commencement of a tender or exchange offer for more than of the outstanding common stock 
the rights expire on may  management as previously announced  on june  we named nicholas l 
teti  jr  as chairman and chief executive officer 
also on june   we named declan daly as executive vice president europe and chief financial officer and steven c 
trider as senior vice president 
subsequent to the year ended december   on february  we announced the appointment of sandra g 
calman  md  aad  to vice president and chief medical officer 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
however  certain accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside of the control of management 
as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  our management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical operations  our future business plans and projected financial results  the terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the following discusses our significant accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue over the period the service is performed in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
in general  sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the isolagen therapy was administered  in the united kingdom  to each patient using a recommended regimen of injections 
due to the short shelf life  each injection was cultured on an as needed basis and was shipped prior to the individual injection being administered by the physician 
we believe that each injection had stand alone value to the patient 
we invoiced the attending physician when the physician sent his or her patient s tissue sample to us  which created a contractual arrangement between us and the medical professional 
the amount invoiced varied directly with the dose and number of injections requested 
generally  orders were paid in advance by the physician prior to the first injection 
there is no performance provision under any arrangement with any physician  and there is no right to refund or returns for unused injections 
as part of our continuing efforts to evaluate the best uses of our resources  in the fourth quarter of  the board of directors approved the proposed closing of our uk operation 
this closing is expected to be completed during the first half of as a result  we believe that the requirements of sab are met as each injection was shipped  as the risk of loss transferred to our physician customer at that time  the fee was fixed and determinable and collection was reasonably assured 
advance payments were deferred until shipment of the injection s 
the amount of the revenue deferred represented the fair value of the remaining undelivered injections measured in accordance with emerging issues task force issue eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses the issue of accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products or services 
should the physician discontinue the regimen prematurely all remaining deferred revenue is recognized 
we also offered a service whereby we stored a patient s cells for later use in the preparation of injections 
in accordance with eitf  the fee charged for this service is recognized as revenue ratably over the length of the storage agreement 
revenue from the sale of agera s products is recognized upon transfer of title  which is upon shipment of the product to the customer 
cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses our exton  pennsylvania facility houses our corporate headquarters  and our research  development and testing operations 
our london facility has been engaged in the commercialization of our process for which revenue has been earned from the sale of isolagen therapy injections as a means to improve manufacturing technologies that would be used to produce commercial quantities of injections on a profitable basis in the future 
therefore  we classify as cost of sales the costs except for costs related to marketing  sales and general corporate administration incurred in operating our london facility  while the costs incurred in operating our exton  pennsylvania facilities except for costs related to general corporate administration are classified as research and development expenses 
costs of sales includes salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors to develop and manufacture drug materials and delivery devices  inventory used in the manufacturing process  a portion of facilities cost and other indirect manufacturing costs 
those costs  except for the costs of raw materials that have not been used  are expensed as incurred 
historically  autologous cell therapy companies have been hampered by expensive and time consuming manufacturing processes 
we used the commercialization of our isolagen process in the united kingdom as a means of researching and developing manufacturing technologies that could be used to produce commercial quantities of injections on a profitable basis 
through december  our cost of sales has exceeded our revenue 
this reflects the fact that the level of our sales from our commercialization efforts in the united kingdom  did not through december reach the levels necessary for profitable operations  and the development and implementation of improved processes had not yet achieved all of the cost efficiencies we hope to achieve in the future 
in the fourth quarter of our board of directors approved closing our uk operation 
if  in the future  the purposes for which we operate our exton  pennsylvania  facility or any new facilities we open  changes  the allocation of the costs incurred in operating that facility between cost of sales and research and development expenses could change to reflect such operational changes 
agera does not manufacture its own product  but rather  outsources its manufacturing 
cost of sales related to agera primarily consists of the cost of the product paid by agera to the manufacturer of the product 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  develop and manufacture drug materials and delivery devices  and a portion of facilities cost 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
invoicing from third party contractors for services performed can lag several months 
we accrue the costs of services rendered in connection with third party contractor activities based on our estimate of management fees  site management and monitoring costs and data management costs 
actual clinical trial costs may differ from estimated clinical trial costs and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires entities to recognize compensation expense for all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of employee stock options  based on the grant date fair value of those share based payments  adjusted for expected forfeitures 
we adopted sfas no 
r as of january  using the modified prospective application method 
under the modified prospective application method  the fair value measurement requirements of sfas no 
r is applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after january  additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that were outstanding as of january  is recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after january  the compensation cost for that portion of awards is based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
changes to the grant date fair value of equity awards granted before january  are precluded 
the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for awards in footnote disclosures required under sfas no 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we followed the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb no 
to account for our employee and director stock options 
historically  substantially all stock options have been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recognized from substantially all option grants to employees and directors 
however  compensation expense was recognized in connection with the issuance of stock options to non employee consultants in accordance with eitf  accounting for equity instrument that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods and services 
sfas no 
r did not change the accounting for stock based compensation related to non employees in connection with equity based incentive arrangements 
the adoption of sfas no 
r requires additional accounting related to the income tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangement 
this change in accounting resulted in the recognition of compensation expense of million for the year ended december  related to our employee and director stock options 
basic and diluted loss per share for the year ended december  was greater than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb no 
during the year ended december   we granted stock options to purchase million shares of our common stock 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested director and employee stock options which vest over time 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to performance based  non vested employee stock options 
that cost will begin to be recognized when the performance criteria within the respective performance base option grants become probable of achievement 
during december  the board of directors approved the full vesting of all unvested  outstanding stock options issued to current employees and directors 
the board decided to take this action the acceleration event in anticipation of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
as a result of this acceleration event  stock options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock were vested that would have otherwise vested during and later periods 
at the time of the acceleration event  the unamortized grant date fair value of the affected options was approximately million for sfas no 
and sfas no 
pro forma disclosure purposes  which was charged to pro forma expense in the fourth quarter of substantially all of the unvested employee stock options that were subject to the acceleration event had exercise prices above market price of our common stock at the time the board approved the acceleration event 
however  in accordance with sfas r if we had not completed this acceleration event in december  the majority of the million amount discussed above would have been charged against the future results of operations  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal and continuing through later periods as the options vested 
as discussed above  substantially all of the unvested employee stock options which were accelerated had exercise prices above market price at the time of acceleration 
for the purposes of applying apb no 
to such stock options in the statement of operations for the year ended december   the acceleration event was treated as the acceleration of the vesting of employee and director options that otherwise would have vested as originally scheduled  and accordingly was not a modification requiring the remeasurement of the intrinsic value of the options  or the application of variable option accounting  under apb no 
for stock options that had exercise prices below market price at the time of acceleration and that would not have vested originally  a charge of approximately  was recorded in the statement of operations for the year ended december  federal securities and derivative actions as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and part i  item  legal proceedings  set forth elsewhere in this report  we are currently defending ourselves against various class and derivative actions 
we intend to defend ourselves vigorously against these actions 
we cannot currently estimate the amount of loss  if any  that may result from the resolution of these actions  and no provision has been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
generally  a loss must be both reasonably estimable and probable in order to record a provision for loss 
we will expense our legal costs as they are incurred and will record any insurance recoveries on such legal costs in the period the recoveries are received 
although we have not recorded a provision for loss regarding these matters  a loss could occur in a future period 
we are involved in various other legal matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business 
although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters  management believes that the results will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
results of operations comparison of years ending december  and revenue 
revenue decreased million  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenue is primarily due to the contraction of our physician customer base in the united kingdom as a result of our decision  during the first half of  to place a greater emphasis on the training and proctoring of our physician customers in order to ensure that they were administering the isolagen therapy appropriately  and also due to our decision  in the fourth quarter  to close our uk operation 
in terms of product volumes as measured by milliliter of product  volumes decreased by approximately during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  average selling price per milliliter of treatment decreased approximately during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the average selling price fluctuated as we investigated various price points in the united kingdom market 
in addition  our average selling price per milliliter has declined due to the increase in six milliliter treatment programs sold during the year ended as compared to lesser average milliliter treatments sold during the year ended generally  higher milliliter treatments have a higher aggregate selling price than lower milliliter treatments  however  the average price per milliliter is lower 
in addition  after the completion of a standard treatment  certain patients requested and paid for an additional one to three milliliters of treatment 
such additional treatment volumes increased by approximately during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase in volume was offset by a decrease in average selling price of approximately 
the revenue which we recognized during the years ended december  and was in part reduced by the effects of promotional incentives provided to doctors utilizing the isolagen therapy 
from time to time  we provided promotional incentives  or no charge treatments  to doctors utilizing the isolagen therapy 
such promotional incentives are not reflected as revenue  but rather  are reflected as marketing expense in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we also offered a service whereby we store a patient s cells for later use in the preparation of injections 
the fees charged for this service are recognized as revenue ratably over the length of the storage agreement 
revenue from this service in the year ended december  and was less than million and less than million  respectively 
additionally  we offered a service whereby we processed a patient s cells to expand the cells to the mass necessary to prepare an injection  and stored the expanded cells for later use in the preparation of injections 
revenue from this service  since our inception  is less than million 
revenue contributed by our august  acquisition of agera was approximately million for the year ended december  on a pro forma basis  assuming that agera had been acquired on january  and  respectively  our revenue would have been million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these consolidated amounts would have included agera revenue of and million for fiscal and  respectively 
as discussed above  the substantial majority of our revenue has resulted from sales involving isolagen therapy from our united kingdom operations  which was engaged in the commercialization of our process and for which revenue has been earned from the sale of isolagen therapy injections as a means to improve manufacturing technologies with the objective that those technologies would be used to produce commercial quantities of injections on a profitable basis in the future 
as the result of our decision to close the united kingdom operations  these revenues will essentially cease during the first quarter of  and our full year revenue will likely be comprised principally of the revenue from agera 
however  since  as discussed below  the united kingdom operation had been operating on a negative gross margin as it investigated means to improve manufacturing technologies for the isolagen process  the loss of the revenues from the united kingdom operation is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations 
cost of sales 
costs of sales decreased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in cost of sales is primarily related to the decrease in sales  which resulted in decreases in essentially all categories of manufacturing costs in the united kingdom operation 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of sales were approximately for the year ended december  and approximately for the year ended december  the change in this percentage is the result of the lower level of sales activity during our lower revenue volume has resulted in an increased fixed manufacturing cost per treatment  and as such  our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue has been negatively impacted 
cost of sales related to our august  acquisition of agera were approximately million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  agera cost of sales were approximately for the year ended december  agera s cost of sales  as a percentage of revenue  for all of and including the periods prior to our august  acquisition of a interest in agera were and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase included million of selling  general and administrative expenses for agera for the period august  to december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily due to the following a salaries  bonuses and payroll taxes increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for year ended december   due to an increase in the number of our employees  primarily at the executive management level  which resulted in higher salary and bonus expense during the current year 
additionally  as the result of the adoption of sfas r on january   equity based compensation was approximately million higher in as compared to the prior year 
these increases were offset by a decrease in severance expense during of million 
we incurred million of severance expense in the year ended december   as compared to million in the year ended december  b marketing expense decreased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for year ended december  due to decreased marketing and promotional efforts in the united kingdom as a result of our negative gross margins from our uk operation  and due to the closing of the uk operation 
c travel expense decreased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for year ended december   due to less travel between our houston  texas and exton  pennsylvania facilities as a result of our closing of the houston office during  and due to less travel related to our uk personnel as a result of the announced closing of the uk operation 
d consulting expense decreased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to decreased recruiting costs  general consulting expenses and reduced investor relations costs during e legal expenses  net  increased approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   due primarily to costs related to the securities and derivative lawsuits  for which we are defendants  and employment termination matters 
while the change in legal expense  net  is not significant  included in the net legal expenses are insurance refunds of million and  respectively  in the years december  and insurance refunds received related to the reimbursement of legal defense costs are recorded in the period that they are received 
we currently anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will decrease to a range of million to million for the year ended december   principally as the result of the closing of our united kingdom operation 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by approximately million during the year ended december  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  research and development costs are composed primarily of costs related to our efforts to gain fda approval for the isolagen therapy for specific dermal applications in the united states and also include costs to develop manufacturing  cell collection and logistical process improvements 
our initial pivotal phase iii dermal studies and our phase ii dental studies concluded during the first half of we subsequently commenced preparations for a new phase iii dermal trial and in october  we reached an agreement with the fda on the design of our phase iii dermal pivotal study protocol 
research and development costs include personnel and laboratory costs related to these fda trials and certain consulting costs 
the total inception to date cost of research and development as of december  was million 
the fda approval process is extremely complicated and is dependent upon our study protocols and the results of our studies 
in the event that the fda requires additional studies for dermal applications or requires changes in our study protocols or in the event that the results of the studies are not consistent with our expectations  as occurred during with respect to our first pivotal phase iii dermal trial see the recent developments section  the process will be more expensive and time consuming 
due to the complexities of the fda approval process  we are unable to predict what the costs of obtaining approval for the dermal applications will be at this time 
we have other research projects currently underway 
however  research and development costs related to these projects were not material during and the major changes in research and development expense are due primarily to the following a consulting expense decreased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   as a result of decreased expenditures related to our clinical trials and manufacturing process research and development  b salaries and payroll taxes decreased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   as a result of the closure of our research and development facility in houston  texas  during  and termination of related personnel  as well as the termination of certain exton  pennsylvania personnel during and c facility costs  including rent  utilities and other related costs  increased approximately million  due primarily to the new exton  pennsylvania lease which commenced during we currently anticipate that research and development expenses will increase to a range of from million to million during the year december   principally as a result of increased clinical trials 
united kingdom customer settlement 
during  we began an informal study and surveyed a number of patients who had previously received the isolagen treatment to assess patient satisfaction 
some patients surveyed reported sub optimal results from treatment 
one hundred forty nine patients who claimed to have received sub optimal results were retreated for the purpose of determining the reasons for sub optimal results 
only those patients who completed the survey  provided adequate medical records  including before and after photographs  and who were deemed both to have received a sub optimal result from a first treatment administered according to the isolagen protocol  and who were considered to be appropriate patients for treatment with the isolagen process  received re treatment 
no one completing the survey was offered re treatment unless they agreed to these conditions 
following re treatment  a number of patients reported better results than first obtained through the initial treatment by their initial treating physician 
during the first quarter of  we received a number of complaints from certain patients who had learned of the limited re treatment program and also learned that a number of physicians with dissatisfied patients were generating public ill will as a result of our decision to limit the number of patients offered re treatment and were encouraging their dissatisfied patients to seek recourse against us 
in response  in march  we decided that it was in our best interest to address these complaints to foster goodwill in the marketplace and avoid the cost of any potential patient claims 
accordingly  we agreed to resolve any properly documented and substantiated patient complaints by offering to re treat the patient pursuant to the same criteria stated above or pay  approximately us  to the patients identified as having received a sub optimal result 
in order to qualify for re treatment and in addition to the criteria set forth above  the patient will be treated by a physician identified by us who will treat these patients pursuant to a protocol 
in addition  these patients must agree to follow up visits and assessments of their response to treatment 
no patient unlikely to benefit from isolagen therapy will be re treated 
we made this offer to approximately patients during late march accordingly  we believed the range of liability was between  or approximately million  assuming all patients were to choose the  payment  and approximately  or approximately million  assuming all patients elected to be re treated 
the estimated costs for re treatment include the cost of treatment  physician fees and other ancillary costs 
we estimate that of the patients will elect the  offer and will elect to be re treated 
accordingly  we recorded a charge to selling  general and administrative expense for the three months ended march  of million 
as of march   no amounts had been expended related to this settlement and the million liability was included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet 
during the three months ended june   an additional patients were entered into the settlement program  resulting in an additional charge to selling  general and administrative expense of million 
during the year ended december   payments to patients and re treatments reduced the accrual by million 
as of december   the liability included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet was million 
the estimates of the factors which will affect the actual cost of this program may change in future periods and the effects of any changes in these estimates will be accounted for in the period in which the estimate changes 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income resulted principally from a decrease in the amount of cash  restricted cash and short term investment balances  as a result of our normal operating activities related to our efforts to gain fda approval for the isolagen therapy for specific dermal applications in the united states 
interest expense 
interest expense remained constant at million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  our interest expense is related to the issuance in november of million in principal amount of convertible subordinated debt  as well as the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs of million for the year ended december  net loss 
net loss for the year ended december  was million as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  our net loss  in total  was unchanged from however  the individual components of net loss have fluctuated  as discussed above 
as a result of increasing foreign currency exchange rates since december   specifically the exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound and the swiss franc  our accumulated other comprehensive loss of million at december  decreased to an accumulated other comprehensive loss of million at december   or a change of million 
however  this loss is considered unrealized and is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet 
accordingly  this unrealized loss may increase or decrease in the future  based on the movement of foreign currency exchange rates  but will not have an impact on net income loss until the related foreign capital investments are sold or otherwise realized 
results of operations comparison of years ending december  and revenue 
revenue increased million  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the continuation of the level of operations in the united kingdom achieved in the second half of  as approximately of revenue was earned during the last six months of however  the increase in revenue was less than management anticipated 
in terms of product volumes as measured by milliliter of product  volumes increased by approximately during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  average selling price per milliliter of treatment decreased approximately during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the average selling price has fluctuated as we continued to investigate various price points in the united kingdom market 
in addition  our average selling price per milliliter declined due to the increase in four and six milliliter treatment programs sold during the year ended as compared to primarily three milliliter treatments sold during the year ended generally  higher milliliter treatments have a higher selling price than lower milliliter treatments  however  the average price per milliliter decreases 
in addition  after the completion of a standard treatment  a patient may request and pay for an additional milliliter of treatment 
such additional treatment volumes increased by approximately during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase in volume was offset by a decrease in average selling price of approximately 
the revenue which we recognized during the year ended december  and was in part reduced by the effects of promotional incentives provided to doctors utilizing the isolagen therapy 
from time to time  we provided promotional incentives  or no charge treatments  to doctors utilizing the isolagen therapy 
such promotional incentives are not reflected as revenue  but rather  are reflected as marketing expense in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we also offered a service whereby we store a patient s cells for later use in the preparation of injections 
the fees charged for this service were recognized as revenue ratably over the length of the storage agreement 
revenue from this service in the year ended december  and was less than million and less than million  respectively 
additionally  we offer a service whereby we process a patient s cells to expand the cells to the mass necessary to prepare an injection  but then store the expanded cells for later use in the preparation of injections 
revenue from this service  since our inception  is less than million 
overall we believe our revenue  as compared to anticipated revenue  was adversely affected by the following factors our sales remained heavily concentrated in the united kingdom 
we envisioned a much greater geographical reach 
our marketing efforts in the united kingdom were curtailed by marketing restrictions 
we were unable to effectively and efficiently implement manufacturing process and technology improvements in the united kingdom which led to a high variable cost base and negative margins during the period of implementation of these improvements 
as a result  we dedicated less resources toward market development 
at the time of our initial projections  we assumed a positive bla submission during as a result of our trial results and our inability to file the bla  we dedicated less resources than we previously anticipated towards market development 
cost of sales 
costs of sales increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million in cost of sales is primarily related to the increase in sales 
the increase in cost of sales resulted from increases in essentially all categories of costs as the united kingdom operation increased its commercialization of our therapy 
during the year ended december   we continued to increase manufacturing headcount and related overhead costs commensurate with demand 
for the year ended december   our cost of sales exceeded revenue as the development and implementation of improved manufacturing processes had not yet achieved all of the cost efficiencies we anticipate 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of sales were approximately for the year ended december  and approximately for the year ended december  the change in this percentage is the result of the lower level of sales activity during  our early stage of commercial development and the associated lower level of operational activity 
as product volumes increased  our fixed costs had been spread over a greater number of units  thereby lowering cost of sales as a percentage of revenue 
in addition  as a result of certain manufacturing initiatives  we had experienced improvements regarding the quantity of certain materials utilized in our manufacturing process  thereby lowering our cost of sale as a percentage of revenue 
as previously discussed  we have been using the commercialization of the isolagen therapy in the uk market as a means aimed at improving our manufacturing process 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily due to the following a other general and administrative costs increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   due primarily to increased facility occupancy costs of million  increased accounting fees of million  increased insurance and office costs of million and increased general costs related to increasing headcount and higher overall business activity of million 
further  a million impairment charge related to certain third party developed software costs was recorded during the year ended december  as such software was taken out of service and not expected to provide future value 
b promotional expense increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for year ended december  due to increased marketing and promotional efforts related to the efforts to expand our operations in the united kingdom and increase our revenue 
c legal expenses increased approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   due primarily to costs related to the securities and derivative lawsuits  for which we are defendants  and employment termination matters 
d salaries and compensation increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for year ended december   due to an increase in the number of our employees 
this increase in the number of employees was offset by a decrease in severance expenses during of million 
we incurred million of severance expense in the year ended december   as compared to million in the year ended december  e travel expense increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for year ended december   due primarily to increased travel between our houston  texas and exton  pennsylvania locations as compared to the prior year 
f consulting expense decreased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the consulting costs included million of stock based expenses related to options and warrants issued under consulting and distribution agreements and million of stock compensation related to stock options issued to directors 
during the year ended december   there was approximately million of stock based expense 
the level of the expense recorded for the warrants issued under consulting and distribution contracts varies from quarter to quarter based on changes in the market price of our common stock  and the negative expense in reflects the effects of the decline in the price of our common stock 
the decrease in stock based expenses of million  discussed above  was offset by an increase of million related to increased recruiting costs  general consulting expenses and investor relations costs during research and development 
research and development expenses increased by approximately million during the year ended december  to million  as compared to million in the year ended december  research and development costs were composed primarily of costs related to our efforts to gain fda approval for the isolagen therapy for specific dermal applications in the united states and also included costs to develop manufacturing  cell collection and logistical process improvements 
our initial pivotal phase iii dermal studies and our phase ii dental studies concluded during the first half of we subsequently commenced preparations for a confirmatory phase iii dermal trial  although we later determined to conduct a new pivotal phase iii dermal trial 
such costs include personnel and laboratory costs related to these fda trials and certain consulting costs 
the total inception to date cost of research and development as of december  was million 
the fda approval process is extremely complicated and is dependent upon our study protocols and the results of our studies 
in the event that the fda requires additional studies for dermal applications or requires changes in our study protocols or in the event that the results of the studies are not consistent with our expectations  as occurred during with respect to our pivotal phase iii dermal trial see the recent developments section  the process will be more expensive and time consuming 
due to the complexities of the fda approval process  we are unable to predict what the cost of obtaining approval for the dermal applications will be at this time 
also  during the third quarter of  we began an investigational study related to patients subjectively considered to be poor responders to the isolagen therapy or the suboptimal program 
approximately patients were included in this suboptimal program 
we had other research projects underway in however  research and development costs related to these projects were not material during and the major changes in research and development expense were due primarily to the following a consulting expense increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   as a result of increased expenditures related to our clinical trials and manufacturing process research and development  b salaries and payroll taxes increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   as a result of increased employees engaged in research and development activities and c facility costs  including rent  utilities and other related costs  increased approximately million  due primarily to the new exton  pennsylvania lease which commenced during interest income 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income of million resulted principally from an increase in the amount of cash held in interest bearing accounts  and our investment in marketable debt securities  due to the investment of the proceeds from the issuance of million of convertible subordinated debt in the fourth quarter of  as well as an increase in interest rates over the comparable period 
we expect our interest income to decrease in as we continue to utilize our cash and available for sale investments to fund operations and capital expenditures 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense of million is related to the interest expense associated with the issuance on november  of million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  as well as the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs of million for the year ended december  our notes were outstanding for approximately two months in  as compared to outstanding for the full year in net loss 
net loss for the year ended december  was million as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  this increase in net loss of million represents the effects of the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses and interest expense  partially offset by the increase in our interest income and improvement in gross margin 
as a result of declining foreign currency exchange rates since december   specifically the exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound and the swiss franc  our accumulated other comprehensive income of million at december  has decreased to an accumulated other comprehensive loss of million at december   or a change of million 
however  this loss is considered unrealized and is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet 
accordingly  this unrealized loss may increase or decrease in the future  based on the movement of foreign currency exchange rates  but will not have an impact on net income loss until the related foreign capital investments are sold or otherwise realized 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities for the three years ended december  were as follows year ended december  in millions cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities operating activities 
cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  amounted to million  a decrease of million over the year ended december  the decrease in our cash used in operating activities over the prior year is primarily due to a decrease in net losses adjusted for non cash items of million  with the balance of million attributable to our changes in operating assets and liabilities 
our negative operating cash flows in were funded from cash on hand at december  and the net proceeds from the liquidation of available for sale investments held at december   both of which we derived from the proceeds of our issuances of common stock and convertible subordinated notes 
investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities during the year ended december  amounted to million  an increase of million over the year ended december  inflow of million 
this increase in cash provided is due primarily to the decrease in cash used for capital expenditures of million  offset by million of cash used net of cash acquired for the acquisition of the interest in agera and offset by a million reduction in the liquidation of our available for sale investments  net 
the characterization of investments between available for sale investments and cash equivalents varies based upon the maturity date of the investment 
accordingly  if an available for sale investment matures or is sold and the proceeds are used to purchase a cash equivalent security  then this would represent a liquidation of available for sale investments 
in we liquidated a net of million of short term investments  which were purchased with the net proceeds of our issuances of common stock and convertible subordinated notes 
this reduction of short term investments was used to fund our purchases of property and equipment  our acquisition of agera and to partially fund our negative operating cash flows 
our purchases of property and equipment primarily related to our acquisition of land and buildings in switzerland  and related improvements  and the build out of our exton  pennsylvania manufacturing facility 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december   as compared to cash provided of million in the current year and prior year amount consists of the funds received related to stock option exercises 
the proceeds consisted substantially of a the proceeds from the sale of  shares of common stock in a public offering in june for cash totaling million  after deducting the costs and expenses associated with the sale and b the proceeds from the sale of million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due november   netting million  after deducting the costs and expenses associated with the sale and our  share repurchase of our stock 
in november  we issued million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due november  the convertible subordinated notes are convertible at the option of the holder into our common stock at an initial conversion rate subject to adjustment of shares of common stock per  principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  at any time prior to the stated maturity 
in the event of certain fundamental changes that occur prior to november   we are required to pay a make whole premium to the holders of the convertible subordinated notes that convert their convertible subordinated notes into our common stock on or after the date on which notice of such fundamental change is given 
the net proceeds from the convertible subordinated notes were approximately million 
we used approximately million of the proceeds to repurchase  shares of common stock  and intend to use the remainder for general corporate purposes 
working capital at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash of million and working capital of million including our cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash 
the substantial majority of our working capital change  as compared to december   relates to the use of our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and available for sale investments for the purpose of funding and operating our business  including capital expenditures and our acquisition of agera 
our ability to operate profitably is contingent upon our success in obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates  development of markets for our products  and development of profitable scalable manufacturing processes 
we believe our existing capital resources are adequate to finance our operations through at least january   but we will need to engage in a capital raising transaction prior to the spring of or we will need to significantly modify our business plan in order to sustain our operations 
we can not assure you that we will be able to obtain regulatory approvals of our product candidates  successfully develop the markets for our product candidates or develop profitable scalable manufacturing processes or obtain the capital we require on terms that we would find acceptable  or at all 
factors affecting our capital resources we believe that the amount of the charges associated with the decision to close the uk operation  such as the related lease exit negotiations and professional fees  among other items  cannot be precisely estimated at this time 
however  as of december   such charges are expected to be no more than approximately million both before and after tax  excluding potential claims or contingencies unknown at this time and excluding normal operating costs through the date of close 
the charges will be reflected over more than one quarter  with the majority of all costs expected to be incurred by the fourth quarter of however  no assurances can be given with respect to the total cost of closing the uk operation or the timing of such costs 
in april  we acquired a two building   square foot corporate campus in bevaix  canton of neuch tel  switzerland for million 
the million purchase price was paid using cash on hand from the proceeds of our issuances of common stock and convertible subordinated notes 
our initial estimate of the total cost of acquisition and renovation of the facility  including the purchase of required equipment  was million  which includes approximately million we had spent in renovations 
the corporate campus is held for sale at december  with a value of million  which management currently believes is the net realizable value of the corporate campus 
however  there can be no assurance of the sale of the corporate campus  nor of the amount of proceeds to be received  if and when sold 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt obligations  excluding interest interest lease obligations purchase obligations obligations in connection with acquisition total the table above assumes that our convertible subordinated notes will be called due on november  refer to the below for a description of our convertible subordinated notes 
in addition to the above  we have  in the ordinary course of business  various contractual agreements with various consultants and service providers whereby a fee or rate per hour has been agreed to  but no guaranteed minimums have been established 
generally  such agreements are related to our research and development efforts or general operating matters 
the above table should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  which illustrate a net loss of million  net cash used in operations of million during and cash paid for capital expenditures and acquisitions of million during in august  we paid million in cash to acquire a interest in agera and also we agreed to contribute million to the working capital of agera to support marketing and inventory acquisitions 
in addition  the acquisition agreement includes future contingent payments up to a maximum of million 
such additional purchase price is based upon certain percentages of agera s cost of sales incurred after june  accordingly  based upon the financial performance of agera  up to an additional million of purchase price may be due to the selling shareholder in future periods 
we believe any such payments will not be significant in fiscal year the timing of future payments may differ from the estimates above  and will depend on the future operating performance of agera 
in november  we issued million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due november   although these notes may be due sooner as discussed below 
the notes are our general  unsecured obligations 
the notes are subordinated in right of payment  which means that they will rank in right of payment behind other indebtedness of ours 
in addition  the notes are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries 
we will be required to repay the full principal amount of the notes on november  unless they are previously converted  redeemed or repurchased 
the notes bear interest at an annual rate of from the date of issuance of the notes 
we will pay interest twice a year  on each may and november  until the principal is paid or made available for payment or the notes have been converted 
interest will be calculated on the basis of a day year consisting of twelve day months 
the note holders may convert the notes into shares of our common stock at any time before the close of business on november   unless the notes have been previously redeemed or repurchased 
the initial conversion rate which is subject to adjustment for the notes is shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
holders of notes called for redemption or submitted for repurchase will be entitled to convert the notes up to and including the business day immediately preceding the date fixed for redemption or repurchase 
at any time on or after november   we may redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest including additional interest  if any to  but excluding  the redemption date 
the note holders will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on november of  and in addition  if we experience a fundamental change which generally will be deemed to occur upon the occurrence of a change in control or a termination of trading of our common stock  note holders will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes 
in the event of certain fundamental changes that occur on or prior to november   we will also pay a make whole premium to holders that require us to purchase their notes in connection with such fundamental change 
off balance sheet transactions we do not engage in material off balance sheet transactions 
other inflation 
inflation did not have a significant impact on our results for year ended december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the form of foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate risk 
foreign exchange rate risk the large majority of our revenue earned in the year ended december  was derived from operations in the united kingdom 
the results of operations and financial position of our foreign operations were principally measured in their respective functional currencies and translated into us dollars 
the effect of us dollar currency fluctuations against the foreign currency in these countries is somewhat mitigated by the fact that expenses are generally incurred in the same currencies in which the revenue is generated 
our income will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
additionally  approximately of our assets at december  were based in our foreign operations and translated into us dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect as of the end of each accounting period  with the effect of such translation reflected as a separate component of consolidated shareholders deficit 
the large majority of the in foreign assets relates to our swiss corporate campus held for sale  with a value of million at december  accordingly  our consolidated shareholders deficit will fluctuate depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
as a result of increasing foreign currency exchange rates since december   specifically the exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound and the swiss franc  our accumulated other comprehensive income of million at december  has decreased to an accumulated other comprehensive loss of million at december   or a change of approximately million 
however  this million loss is considered unrealized and is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet 
accordingly  this unrealized loss may increase or decrease in the future  based on the movement of foreign currency exchange rates  but will not have an impact on net income loss until the related foreign capital investments are sold or otherwise realized 
interest rate risk our  million convertible subordinated notes  pay interest at a fixed rate and  accordingly  we are not exposed to interest rate risk as a result of this debt 
however  the fair value of our million convertible subordinated notes does vary based upon  among other factors  the price of our common stock and current interest rates on similar instruments 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
