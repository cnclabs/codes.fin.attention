item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in item the following information includes forward looking statements  the realization of which may be affected by certain important factors discussed under risk factors 
overview we are an independent architect of enterprise class information storage infrastructures 
we derive our revenues principally from designing  installing and supporting data storage systems 
our solutions can include hardware products  such as disk arrays  tape systems and interconnection components and storage management software products 
the market for data storage products and services is large 
idc estimates that digital information will occupy more than six times its current quantity  or billion gigabytes  by as of december   we had locations throughout the united states with the highest concentration of revenues in the central states 
we sell support service contracts to most of our customers 
when customers purchase support services through us  customers receive the benefit of integrated system wide support 
we have a qualified  independent support desk that takes calls from customers  diagnoses the issues they are facing and either solves the problem or coordinates with datalink and or vendor technical staff to meet the customer s needs 
our support service agreements with our customers include an underlying agreement with the product manufacturer 
the manufacturer provides on site support assistance if necessary 
we defer revenues and direct costs resulting from these contracts  and amortize these revenues and expenses into operations  over the term of the contracts  which are generally twelve months 
the enterprise class information storage market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
our competition includes other independent storage system integrators  high end value added resellers  distributors  consultants and the internal sales force of our suppliers 
our ability to hire and retain qualified outside sales representatives and engineers with enterprise class information storage experience is critical to effectively competing in the marketplace and achieving our growth strategies 
in the past  we have experienced fluctuations in the timing of orders from our customers  and we expect to continue to experience these fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations have resulted from  among other things  the time required to design  test and evaluate our data storage solutions before customers deploy them  the size of customer orders  the complexity of our customers network environments  necessary system configuration to deploy our solutions and new product introductions by suppliers 
completion of our installation and configuration services may also delay recognition of revenues 
economic conditions and competition also affect our customers decisions to place orders with us 
as a result  our net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we view the current data storage market as providing significant opportunity for growth 
currently  datalink s market share is a small part of the overall market 
however  the providers of the data storage industry s products and technologies are increasing their utilization of indirect sales approaches to broaden their reach and optimize their margins 
increasingly  they are turning to companies such as datalink to sell their products 
while these trends provide opportunity for datalink  we must improve our business model to generate sustainable  profitable growth 
our model requires highly skilled sales and technical staff which results in substantial fixed costs for us 
we believe the best way to improve our company and create long term shareholder value is to focus on building scaleable capabilities and a leverageable cost structure 
our current strategies are focused on increasing productivity of our sales and technical teams in our existing locations 
deepening our presence in existing enterprise accounts and penetrating new enterprise accounts 
growing our customer support revenue and market share 
we believe that our customer support services offerings are becoming increasingly attractive to companies looking for system wide integrated support 
increasing our professional services revenues 
we believe there is an opportunity to sell more of our data storage services such as implementation services  storage environment assessments and on site data storage management and architecture services 
exploring potential regional acquisitions that we believe can strengthen our resources and capabilities in key geographic locations 
on january   we acquired midrange computer solutions inc  a storage consulting  solutions and service provider based in chicago  illinois 
to pursue these strategies  we are improving our training  tools and recruiting efforts for sales and engineering teams to increase productivity 
hiring additional customer support staff and enhancing the customer support staff s communications and call management capabilities 
developing more effective delivery capabilities for professional services and solutions 
focusing on successfully integrating datalink and mcsi 
all of these plans have various challenges and risks associated with them  including that we may not increase our productivity and may lose  or not successfully recruit and retain key sales  technical or other personnel 
competition is intense and may adversely impact our profit margin 
customers have many options for data storage products and services 
we may not successfully integrate mcsi and the failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the operations of datalink and mcsi successfully or otherwise to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the merger could seriously harm our business

we derived approximately of our sales from our customer  cingular wireless llc  during we cannot provide assurance that this customer will account for a substantial portion of our future sales 
we had no other customers that comprised more than of our sales in  or gross profit 
our total gross profit as a percentage of net sales remained flat at in as compared to in  which was an increase from in product gross profit as a percentage of product sales increased to in as compared to in and as compared to in the percentage improvement in both and reflects the increase in enhanced data recovery technology solution purchases made by our customers for which we achieved a higher gross profit 
we have various programs in place with our vendors that provide economic incentives for achieving various sales performance targets 
achieving these targets contributed favorably to our product gross profit in  and these vendor incentive programs constantly change and we negotiate them separately with each vendor 
while we expect the incentive programs to continue  the vendors could modify or discontinue them  which would unfavorably impact our product gross profit margins

sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include wages and commissions paid to sales and marketing personnel  travel costs and advertising  promotion and hiring expenses 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million  or of net sales for as compared to million  or of net sales for and million  or of net sales for the increase in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars for over is primarily a result of higher commission expense of million in as compared to the increase in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars for over is primarily a result of higher commission and bonus expenses of million due to the higher sales volume in as compared to the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales from to and from to reflects better leverage of our fixed costs as revenues increased in both and as we continue to selectively hire additional outside sales representatives  our sales and marketing expenses may increase without a commensurate increase in sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include wages for administrative personnel  professional fees  depreciation  communication expenses and rent and related facility expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net sales for compared to million  or of net sales for and million  or in the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars for as compared to is due to an increase of  in facilities expenses for several new lease agreements for regional offices entered into during the second and third quarter of  an increase of  for board compensation expense and an increase of  for sales and use tax expense for several state audits 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars for as compared to is due to a decrease of  in depreciation expense primarily for our customer relationship management system and reduced facilities expenses of  related to the sublease of our chanhassen facility 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in variable compensation for executives and managers of  and an increase in accounting  legal and consulting fees of  for fees related to sec and sarbanes oxley compliance activity 
our general and administrative expenses were lower as a percentage of net sales for as compared to  and for as compared to  due to more controlled spending coupled with an increase in revenues 
engineering 
engineering expenses include employee wages and travel  hiring and training expenses for our field and customer support engineers and technicians 
we allocate engineering costs associated with installation and configuration services and with consulting services to our cost of service sales 
engineering expenses increased to million  or of net sales in compared to million  or of net sales in and million  or of net sales in the increase in engineering expenses in absolute dollars for as compared to is due primarily to a  increase in compensation expense related to a increase in headcount coupled with higher health insurance expenses 
the increase in engineering expenses in absolute dollars for as compared to is due primarily to an increase in compensation expense of million related to a increase in headcount coupled with higher health insurance expenses and variable compensation expenses 
the decrease in engineering expenses as a percentage of sales for as compared to is the result of more controlled spending coupled with an increase in revenues 
the increase in engineering expenses as a percentage of sales for as compared to is the result of higher engineering expenses despite the growth in revenues 
in  we added personnel resources for our customer support desk staff 
sublease arrangements 
in december  we agreed to sublease approximately  of the  square feet we then occupied as our corporate headquarters in chanhassen  minnesota 
the initial sublease term is co terminal with our lease and is for months starting in april and ending in april the sublessee will pay us rent ranging from approximately  per month at the beginning of the term to approximately  per month by the end of the term 
we also negotiated with our landlord to sell the acre lot adjoining our facility for  in the first quarter of  we incurred a one time  non cash charge of million related to the sublease and lot sale 
we obtained cost savings of approximately  in and as a result of the sublease agreement and expect to achieve comparable savings in future years during the sublease term 
intangible amortization 
we had no expense related to the amortization of intangible assets in amortization of intangible assets decreased to  in from  in the amortization relates primarily to our acquisition of the data storage and services business of opensystems 
com  inc in november we test for impairment of goodwill and intangibles annually or whenever impairment is indicated 
for and  we determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
we fully amortized the customer base intangible asset in on january  we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with midrange computer systems inc mcsi a storage consulting  solutions and service provider based in chicago  illinois 
we are currently in the process of determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and therefore have not yet determined the allocation of the purchase price 
operating earnings loss 
we realized operating earnings of million in and incurred operating losses of million in and excluding the sublease charge of million in the first quarter of  we generated operating income of  in our operating earnings increase is a result of higher revenues and gross margins  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
income taxes 
we had an income tax benefit of million in we had no income tax benefit or expense in or prior to fiscal  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the realization and timing of the benefits from those deferred tax assets as we had not achieved a sufficient level of sustained profitability 
during  we utilized approximately million of our net operating loss carryforwards 
furthermore  we concluded that we had attained a sufficient level of sustained profitability to reverse the remaining valuation allowance of million 
we utilized approximately  of our federal net operating loss carryforwards for the year ending december  for  we recorded approximately  as a credit to equity for tax benefits associated with the exercises of stock options during in future earnings periods  we will report income taxes at normalized rates 
quarterly results and seasonality the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly financial data for each quarter of and we have prepared this unaudited information on the same basis as the audited information

in thousands net sales gross profit operating earnings loss net earnings loss we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  quarterly variations in our net sales as a result of a number of factors  including the length of the sales cycle with customers for large storage system evaluations and purchases  delays in storage system installations or configurations  new product introductions by suppliers and their market acceptance  delays in product shipments or other quality control difficulties  trends in the enterprise class information storage industry in general or the geographic and industry specific markets in which we are currently active  or may be in the future 
in addition  economic conditions and competition also affect our customers decisions to place orders with us 
further  our success in integrating any acquired business or in opening any new field offices could impact our net sales

we discontinued our employee stock purchase plan in december our bank revolving credit facility expired in june we have not renewed it or pursued a new facility 
we have no outstanding debt  and if the need should arise to borrow funds  we believe that we could obtain a secured facility 
we have an year non cancelable operating lease for our corporate headquarters in chanhassen  minnesota which expires in the lease requires annual base rental payments of approximately million 
in december  we agreed to sublease approximately  of the  square feet we then occupied 
the initial term of the sublease is co terminal with our lease and is for months starting in april and ending in april the sublease requires rent payments ranging from  per month at the beginning of the term to approximately  per month by the end of the term 
for more information  see note of the notes to our financial statements 
on january   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with midrange computer systems inc mcsi  a storage consulting  solutions and service provider based in chicago  illinois 
we paid a purchase price of million for mcsi  consisting of million cash million of which we paid at closing to the shareholders and  of which we deposited in escrow and  shares of our common stock  shares of which we issued at closing to the shareholders and  shares of which we deposited in escrow 
based upon a post closing audit  we will reduce the purchase price by the shortfall  if any  against the agreed upon minimum net assets at the time of closing 
contractual obligations and commitments as of december   our contractual cash obligations consist of future minimum lease payments due under non cancelable operating leases as follows lease sublease net lease obligations agreements obligations in thousands thereafter from time to time we enter into purchase commitments with our suppliers under customary purchase order terms 
any significant losses implicit in these contracts would be recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

the initial sublease term is co terminal with our lease and is months starting in april and ending in april the sublessee pays us rent ranging from approximately  per month at the beginning of the term to approximately  per month by the end of the term 
the rent includes the costs of common area management  common systems repairs  real estate taxes and standard utilities 
we also negotiated with our landlord to sell the acre lot adjoining our facility for  which we originally acquired in for  we incurred the following charges in the first quarter of associated with our sublease and related activities item sublease charge rent reserve excess of lease expense over sublease income accelerated depreciation loss on land sale total we also incurred cash expenditures for leasehold improvements and transaction fees associated with our sublease and the related activities  net of the proceeds from our lot sale  of  we capitalized these cash outlays and are amortizing them over the lease term 
we believe that our current cash balance and funds generated from operations will finance our current operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we believe if the need should arise to borrow funds  we could obtain a secured facility 
we are planning for  to million of capital expenditures during primarily related to enhancements to our management information systems 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported earnings 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe are reasonable 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  the areas of customer receivables  inventories  investments  income taxes  self insurance reserves and commitments and contingencies 
we believe that the following represent the areas where we use more critical estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
we realize revenue from the design  installation and support of data storage solutions  which may include hardware  software and services 
we recognize revenue when we have met our obligations for installation or other services and collectability is reasonably assured 
product sales 
we sell software and hardware products on both a free standing basis without any services and as data storage solutions bundled with our installation and configuration services bundled arrangements 
product sales without service 
if we sell a software or hardware product and do not provide any installation or configuration services with it  we recognize the product revenues upon shipment 
product sales with service 
if we sell a bundled arrangement  then we defer recognizing any revenues on it until we finish our installation and or configuration work 
we account for the hardware  software and service elements of our bundled arrangements by applying the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop pursuant to the provisions of sop  we apply contract accounting to our bundled arrangements 
in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  we apply the completed contract method 
factors we have considered in applying the completed contract method accounting include i the relatively short duration of our contracts  ii the difficulty of estimating our revenues on a percentage of completion method and iii our use of acceptance provisions on larger bundled arrangements 
service sales 
in addition to installation and configuration services that are part of our bundled arrangements described above  our service sales include customer support contracts and consulting services 
on our balance sheet  deferred revenue relates to service sales for which our customer has paid us or has been invoiced but for which we have not yet performed the applicable services 
customer support contracts 
we sell service contracts to most of our customers 
these contracts are support service agreements 
we have an internal support desk that provides integrated customer support services  including configuration and usage assistance  technical advice and prompt incident detection and resolution 
our technical staff first assists a customer in identifying the source of system problems and in determining whether there is defective hardware or software 
if our customer requires on site maintenance or repair services  we arrange for a service call pursuant to underlying third party support service agreements we have with our hardware and software vendors 
when we sell a service contract as part of a bundled arrangement  we use vendor specific objective evidence to allocate revenue to the service contract element 
in all cases  we defer revenues and direct costs resulting from our service contracts and amortize them into operations over the term of the contracts  which are generally twelve months 
we are contractually obligated to provide or arrange to provide these underlying support services to our customers in the unlikely event that the hardware or software vendor  or its designee  fails to perform according to the terms of its contact 
consulting services 
some of our customers engage us to analyze their existing storage architectures and offer our recommendations 
other customers engage us to assist them on site with extended data storage projects  to support their data storage environments and to help with long term data storage design challenges 
for these types of consulting services that do not include the sale of hardware or software products  we recognize revenues as we perform these services 
gross reporting of revenues 
we report our revenues from the sale of hardware and software products on a gross  rather than a net  basis 
in reporting our revenues on a gross basis  we considered that we are the primary obligor to our customers 
we are responsible for fulfillment  including the acceptability of the products and services to our customers 
we have the risk of loss for inventory and credit 
we establish the prices for our products and services with our customers 
we are responsible for the installation and configuration services ordered by our customers 
commission expense 
we utilize a direct sales force to generate virtually all of our revenues 
we pay our sales people a combination of base salary and commissions 
we pay commissions based on the amount of gross profit generated from the products and services sold 
we match commissions to the appropriate transactions and recognize commission expense at the time we recognize the related revenues and gross profit 
inventory 
we periodically review  estimate and adjust our reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the inventory cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
results could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of economic or competitive conditions  length of industry downturn  or if products become obsolete because of technical advancements in the industry 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on total market capitalization as compared to the carrying value of our net assets 
if our total market capitalization is at or below the carrying value of our net assets  it may prompt us to engage a third party valuation firm to perform a valuation of us to further assess whether our goodwill or other intangibles are impaired pursuant to sfas we consider our goodwill impairment test estimates critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts 
deferred income taxes 
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax liabilities or assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly assess the likelihood that we will recover our deferred tax assets from future taxable income in  we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believed was more likely than not to be realizable 
we considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
during  management concluded that we had attained a sufficient level of sustained profitability to reverse our remaining million valuation allowance 
in future earnings periods  we will report income taxes at normalized rates 
stock based compensation 
we adopted the provisions of fasb no 
r  share based payment on january  fasb r requires us to measure and recognize in our statements of operations the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we utilize the black scholes option valuation model to measure the amount of compensation expense we recognize for each option award 
there are several assumptions that we must make when using the black scholes model such as the expected term of each option  the expected volatility of the stock price during the expected term of the option  the expected dividends payable and the risk free interest rate expected during the option term 
of these assumptions  the expected term of the options and expected volatility of our common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of employees and the expected future performance of our stock 
an increase in the volatility of our stock price or an increase in the average period before exercise will increase the amount of compensation expense related to awards granted after december  the fair value of non vested stock awards is determined based on the fair value of the stock on the date of grant 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes a interpretation of fasb statement fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
this interpretation provides that a company can recognize the tax effects from an uncertain tax position in its financial statements only if the position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective as of the beginning of fiscal  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we have completed a preliminary evaluation of the impact of adopting fin on our financial statements and do not believe it will have a material impact 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which provides guidance on how to measure assets and liabilities that use fair value 
sfas will apply whenever another us gaap standard requires or permits measurement of assets or liabilities at fair value  but does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances 
this standard also will require additional disclosures in both annual and quarterly reports 
sfas will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we intend to adopt the standard beginning in the first quarter of we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our financial statements and do not believe it will have a material impact 
in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice in how public companies quantify misstatements of financial statements  including misstatements not material to prior years financial statements 
we applied the provisions of sab in connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
part of this statement is effective as of december   and requires companies with defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to recognize prospectively the funded status of those plans on their balance sheet from the effective date 
because we do not have any defined benefit pension plans or other postretirement benefit plans  the adoption of sfas does not have an impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates 
unrealized gains and losses on these items will be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option may be applied instrument by instrument with a few exceptions  is irrevocable and is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
on our financial statements and do not believe it will have a material impact 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years 
we cannot assure you that inflation will not adversely affect our business in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we do not believe that we have any material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required 
the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
interest rate risk 
as of december   we had million of cash and money market accounts 
a decrease in market rates of interest would have no material effect on the value of these assets or the related interest income due to the nature of money market accounts 
we have no short or long term debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we market and sell all of our products and services in the united states 
therefore  we are not currently exposed to any direct foreign currency exchange rate risk 
equity price risk 
we do not own any equity investments 
therefore  we are not currently exposed to any direct equity price risk
