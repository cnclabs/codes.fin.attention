item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general park is a global advanced materials company which develops  manufactures and markets high technology digital and rf microwave printed circuit materials and advanced composite materials principally for the telecommunications and internet infrastructure  high end computing and aerospace markets 
the company s manufacturing facilities are located in singapore  china  france  connecticut  new york  arizona and california 
the company s products are marketed and sold under the nelco r and nelcote tm names 
the global electronics manufacturing industry  which had become extremely and unsustainably overheated in the s and into calendar year  collapsed in calendar year  and has not recovered since that collapse 
the company believes that the industry has become a mature industry  and the company does not expect significant non cyclical  sustainable growth from that industry in the future 
the company s net sales increased in the fiscal year ended february  compared with the fiscal year ended february  as a result of increases in sales of the company s printed circuit materials in north america and asia and increases in sales of the company s advanced composite materials  and the company achieved higher operating profits and higher net earnings in the fiscal year compared with the fiscal year 
the company s net earnings for the fiscal year ended february  were increased by a tax benefit of million recorded by the company in the fiscal year fourth quarter relating to the recognition of tax credits resulting from operating losses sustained in prior years in france and by tax benefits recognized by the company in the fiscal year second quarter of million relating to the elimination of certain valuation allowances previously established relating to deferred tax assets in the united states  million relating to the elimination of reserves no longer required as the result of the completion of a tax audit and relating to the termination of a life insurance arrangement with jerry shore  the company s founder and former chairman  president and chief executive officer  and such net earnings were reduced by a pre tax charge of million recorded by the company in the fiscal year second quarter relating to the termination of such insurance arrangement 
the company s net earnings for the fiscal year ended february  were reduced by a tax charge of million recorded in the fourth quarter in connection with the repatriation of approximately million of accumulated earnings and profits of the company s nelco products pte 
ltd 
subsidiary in singapore  a pre tax asset impairment charge of million recorded in the fourth quarter for the write off of construction costs related to the installation of a treater at the company s neltec europe sas facility in mirebeau  france and a pre tax employment termination benefits charge of million related to a workforce reduction at the company s neltec europe sas facility recorded in the fiscal year first quarter  and such net earnings were increased by a tax benefit of million recognized by the company in the fiscal year third quarter relating to the elimination of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets recorded in the united states in prior periods 
the improvement in the company s operating performance during the fiscal year was attributable principally to increases in total sales of the company s printed circuit materials products and higher percentages of sales of higher margin  high performance printed circuit materials products 
this improvement occurred in spite of significant increases in the cost of copper foil  one of the company s primary raw materials  during the first and second quarters of the fiscal year  as the company was able to pass a substantial portion of such increases through to its customers in the second  third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year 
the condition of the global markets for the company s printed circuit materials products improved in the second half of the fiscal year  and that improvement continued in the first nine months of the fiscal year  although such markets weakened in the fiscal year fourth quarter 
consequently  sales of the company s printed circuit materials products increased in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year 
however  the weakness that occurred in the markets for the company s printed circuit materials products in the fiscal year fourth quarter has continued into the fiscal year first quarter 
the markets for the company s advanced composite materials products continued to be strong during the fiscal year  and sales of the company s advanced composite materials products increased in the fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
the global markets for the company s printed circuit materials continue to be very difficult to forecast  and it is not clear to the company what the condition of the global markets for the company s printed circuit materials will be in the fiscal year 
the company believes that the markets for its advanced composite materials will continue to be strong during the fiscal year 
in the first quarter of the fiscal year  the company completed the construction of a new manufacturing facility in the zhuhai free trade zone in guangdong province in southern china to support the demand for advanced printed circuit materials in china  and the company is in the process of equipment testing  employee training and internal and external qualifications for the facility 
in addition  the company upgraded its printed circuit materials treating operation in singapore during the fiscal year third quarter so that such operation is capable of treating the company s full line of advanced printed circuit materials in singapore  except polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe materials  and during the fiscal year  the company installed one of its latest generation  high technology treaters in its newly expanded facility in singapore 
in the third quarter of the fiscal year  the company acquired a facility in singapore which the company is modifying and expanding for use as a new advanced composites manufacturing plant 
the company is also in the final stages of planning the construction of a new plant in the untied states to produce advanced composite materials principally for the aerospace industry 
in addition  during the fiscal year second quarter  the company completed the installation of an additional large treater at its advanced composite materials facility in waterbury  connecticut  which has significantly increased the treating capacity of that facility 
while the company continued to expand and invest in its business during the and fiscal years  it made additional adjustments to one of its operations  which resulted in a workforce reduction 
in the fiscal year first and second quarters  the company reduced the size of the workforce at its neltec europe sas subsidiary in mirebeau  france as a result of further deterioration of the european market for high technology printed circuit materials  and it recorded an employment termination benefits charge of million during the fiscal year first quarter  million of which was reversed in the fiscal year fourth quarter 
in addition  during the fiscal year  the company reduced the sizes of the workforces at its north american and european printed circuit materials operations  as a result of which the company recorded pre tax charges of million in the fiscal year third quarter 
in the fiscal year third quarter  the company also settled an insurance claim for property and business interruption losses sustained by the company in singapore as a result of an explosion in one of the four treaters located at its nelco manufacturing facility in singapore and recorded a pre tax gain of million as a result of the settlement 
the company believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to generally accepted accounting principles gaap financial measures  which include special items  such as the tax benefits  the earnings repatriation tax charge  the asset impairment charge  the insurance arrangement termination charge and the employment termination benefits charge in the and fiscal years 
accordingly  in addition to disclosing its financial results determined in accordance with gaap  the company discloses non gaap operating results that exclude special items in order to assist its shareholders and other readers in assessing the company s operating performance  since the company s on going  normal business operations do not include such special items 
such non gaap financial measures are provided to supplement the results provided in accordance with gaap 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year the company s sales of both its printed circuit materials and its advanced composite materials increased in the fiscal year ended february  compared to the fiscal year ended february   following increases in such sales in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year 
the increased sales in the fiscal year and a slight improvement in the company s gross profit margin in the fiscal year  following substantial improvements in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year and in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year  enabled the company s operations to generate a larger gross profit than in the prior fiscal year 
the company s gross profit in the fiscal year was substantially higher than the gross profit in the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of increased total sales of printed circuit materials products and higher percentages of sales by the company of its higher margin  high performance printed circuit materials products 
sales of the company s advanced composite materials products also increased during the fiscal year primarily as a result of the strength of the aerospace markets for advanced composite materials 
sales of advanced composite materials were of the company s total net sales worldwide in the and fiscal years 
the company s financial results of operations were enhanced by the tax benefit of million recorded by the company in the fiscal year fourth quarter for the recognition of tax credits resulting from operating losses sustained in prior years in france and by the tax benefits recorded in the fiscal year second quarter of million relating to the elimination of certain valuation allowances previously established related to deferred tax assets in the united states  million relating to the elimination of reserves no longer required as the result of the completion of a tax audit and million relating to the termination of a life insurance agreement with jerry shore  the company s founder and former chairman  president and chief executive officer  which benefits were partially offset by a pre tax charge of million in the second quarter relating to the termination of the insurance agreement with jerry shore 
results of operations net sales for the fiscal year ended february  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended february  the increase in net sales was the result of increased sales by the company s operations in north america and asia and increased sales of the company s high technology printed circuit materials and advanced composite materials

during the fiscal year ended february   the company s total net sales worldwide of high temperature printed circuit materials  which included high performance materials non fr printed circuit materials  were of the company s total net sales worldwide of printed circuit materials  compared with for last fiscal year 
the company s high temperature printed circuit materials include its high performance materials non fr printed circuit materials  which consist of high speed  low loss materials for digital and rf microwave applications requiring lead free compatibility  high bandwidth signal integrity  bismalimide triazine bt materials  polyimides for applications that demand extremely high thermal performance  cyanate esters  and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe materials for rf microwave systems that operate at frequencies up to ghz 
during the fiscal year ended february   the company s total net sales worldwide of high performance printed circuit materials non fr printed circuit materials were of the company s total net sales worldwide of printed circuit materials  compared with for last fiscal year 
the company s cost of sales increased by in the fiscal year from the fiscal year as a result of higher sales and higher production volumes in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year and as a result of significant increases in the cost of copper foil  although a substantial portion of the increases in the cost of copper foil was passed on to customers 
however  the company s cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly in the fiscal year compared to the prior year resulting in a slight gross profit percentage improvement  which was attributable to cost containment measures implemented by the company  including workforce reductions 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or by  during the fiscal year compared with the fiscal year as a result of higher sales in the fiscal year  but these expenses  measured as a percentage of sales  were during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative expenses included million for the fiscal year for stock option expenses  which the company recorded pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards r

environmental matters the company is subject to various federal  state and local government requirements relating to the protection of the environment 
the company believes that  as a general matter  its policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling  manufacture  use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with environmental laws and regulations 
however  mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies  which were generally in compliance with applicable laws at the time of the operations in question  the company  like other companies engaged in similar businesses  is a party to claims by government agencies and third parties and has incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs associated with environmental matters 
additional claims and costs involving past environmental matters may continue to arise in the future 
it is the company s policy to record appropriate liabilities for such matters when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
in the  and fiscal years  the company charged approximately million  million  million  respectively  against pre tax income for remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs including legal fees 
while annual expenditures have generally been constant from year to year  and may increase over time  the company expects it will be able to fund such expenditures from cash flow from operations 
the timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors  including regulatory approval of cleanup projects  remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 
at february   the amount recorded in liabilities from discontinued operations for environmental matters related to dielektra was million and the amount recorded in accrued liabilities for other environmental matters was million compared with million of liabilities for environmental matters for dielektra and million for other environmental matters at february  management does not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the liquidity  capital resources  business or consolidated financial position of the company 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report for a discussion of the company s contingencies  including those related to environmental matters 
critical accounting policies and estimates in response to financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  issued by the securities and exchange commission in december  the following information is provided regarding critical accounting policies that are important to the consolidated financial statements and that entail  to a significant extent  the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of management s judgment 
general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to sales allowances  accounts receivable  allowances for bad debts  inventories  valuation of long lived assets  income taxes  restructurings  contingencies and litigation  and pensions and other employee benefit programs 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition sales revenue is recognized at the time title to product is transferred to a customer 
all material sales transactions are for the shipment of manufactured prepreg and laminate products and advanced composite materials 
the company ships its products to customers based upon firm orders  with fixed selling prices  when collection is reasonably assured 
sales allowances the company provides for the estimated costs of sales allowances at the time such costs can be reasonably estimated 
the company s products are made to customer specifications and tested for adherence to such specifications before shipment to customers 
there are no future performance requirements other than the products meeting the agreed specifications 
the company s bases for providing sales allowances for returns are known situations in which products may have failed due to manufacturing defects in the products supplied by the company 
the company is focused on manufacturing the highest quality printed circuit materials and advanced composite materials possible and employs stringent manufacturing process controls and works with raw material suppliers who have dedicated themselves to complying with the company s specifications and technical requirements 
the amounts of returns and allowances resulting from defective or damaged products have been approximately of sales for each of the company s last three fiscal years 
accounts receivable the majority of the company s accounts receivable are due from purchasers of the company s printed circuit materials 
credit is extended based on evaluation of a customer s financial condition and  generally  collateral is not required 
accounts receivable are due within established payment terms and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts outstanding longer than established payment terms are considered past due 
the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible  and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowances for bad debts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketability based upon the age of the inventory and assumptions about future demand for the company s products and market conditions 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
important factors that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes in the use of the company s assets or strategy of the overall business 
income taxes carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations  or conversely to further reduce the existing valuation allowance resulting in less income tax expense
