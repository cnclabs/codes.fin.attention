in several areas 
the statement requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost is recognized over the requisite service period usually the vesting period for the estimated number of instruments where service is expected to be rendered 
this statement is effective for the interim reporting periods beginning after december  the company adopted this statement in the first quarter of the impact of adopting sfas no 
r did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations

the consensus includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include  but is not limited to  sales  use  value added  and some excise taxes 
the consensus states that the presentation of taxes within the scope on either a gross included in revenues and cots or a net excluded from revenues basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed pursuant to accounting principles board apb opinion no 
disclosure of accounting policies 
in addition  for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis  a company should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented if those amounts are significant 
the disclosure of those taxes can be done on an aggregate basis 
the consensus should be applied to financial reports for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of this consensus did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
it also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab topic n financial statements considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated 
sab references both the iron curtain and rollover approaches to quantifying a current year misstatement for purposes of determining the materiality 
the iron curtain approach focuses on how the current year s balance sheet 
table of contents would be affected in correcting a misstatement without considering the year s in which the misstatement originated 
the rollover approach focuses on the amount of the misstatement that originated in the current year s income statement 
sab states that registrants must quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements  including both the carryover and reversing affects of prior year misstatements  on the current year financial statements 
both the iron curtain approach and rollover approach should be used in assessing the materiality of a current year misstatement 
sab provides that once a current year misstatement has been quantified  the guidance in sab topic n  financial statements materiality  sab should be applied to determine whether the misstatement is material and should result in an adjustment to the financial statements 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands the disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the changes to current practice resulting from the application of sfas no relate to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
the definition focuses on the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability at the measurement date an exit price and not the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability at the measurement date an entry price 
this statement also emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement and subsequently a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the statement also clarifies that the market participant assumptions about risk and assumptions about the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
this statement should be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the year in which this statement is initially applied 
a limited form of retrospective application of sfas no 
is allowed for certain financial instruments 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
to determine the potential impact  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
this statement permits companies and not for profit organizations to make a one time election to carry eligible types of financial assets and liabilities at fair value  even if fair value measurement is not required under gaap 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
critical accounting policies in the course of developing and evaluating accounting policies and procedures  we use estimates  assumptions and judgments to determine the most appropriate methods to be applied 
such processes are used in determining capitalization of costs related to real estate investments  potential impairment of real estate investments  operating cost reimbursements  and taxable income 
minimum rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from tenants 
certain leases provide for additional percentage rents based on tenants sales volumes 
these percentage rents are recognized when determinable by us 
in addition  leases for certain tenants contain rent escalations and or free rent during the first several months of the lease term  however such amounts are not material 
real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
all costs related to planning  development and construction of buildings prior to the date they become operational  including interest and real estate taxes during the construction period  are capitalized for financial reporting purposes and recorded as property under development until construction has been completed 
subsequent to completion of construction  expenditures for property maintenance are charged to operations as incurred  while significant renovations are capitalized 
depreciation of the buildings is recorded on the straight line method using an estimated useful life of forty years 

table of contents in determining the fair value of real estate investments  we consider future cash flow projections on a property by property basis  current interest rates and current market conditions of the geographical location of each property 
substantially all of our leases contain provisions requiring tenants to pay as additional rent a proportionate share of operating expenses operating cost reimbursements such as real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance  insurance  etc 
the related revenue from tenant billings is recognized in the same period the expense is recorded 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  commencing with our tax year 
as a result  we are not subject to federal income taxes to the extent that we distribute annually at lease of our taxable income to our shareholders and satisfy certain other requirements defined in the code 
accordingly  no provision was made for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

future scheduled annual maturities of mortgages payable for the years ending december are as follows      the mortgage debt is all fixed rate  self amortizing debt 
in addition  the operating partnership has in place a million credit facility with lasalle bank  as the agent credit facility  which is guaranteed by the company 
the credit facility matures in november and can be extended at our option  for two additional one year periods 
advances under the credit facility bear interest within a range of one month to twelve month libor plus basis points to basis points or the lender s prime rate  at our option  based on certain factors such as the ratio of our indebtedness to the capital value of our properties

table of contents the following table outlines our contractual obligations in thousands as of december  total yr yrs yrs over yrs mortgages payable notes payable land lease obligations other long term liabilities interest payments on mortgages and notes payable total we have one development project under construction that will add an additional  square feet to our portfolio 
the project is expected to be completed during the second quarter of additional funding required to complete the project is estimated to be  and will come from the credit facility 
we intend to meet our short term liquidity requirements  including capital expenditures related to the leasing and improvement of the properties  through cash flow provided by operations and the line of credit 
we believe that adequate cash flow will be available to fund our operations and pay dividends in accordance with reit requirements 
we may obtain additional funds for future development or acquisitions through other borrowings or the issuance of additional shares of common stock 
we intend to incur additional debt in a manner consistent with our policy of maintaining a ratio of total debt including construction and acquisition financing to total market capitalization of or less 
we believe that these financing sources will enable us to generate funds sufficient to meet both our short term and long term capital needs 
we plan to begin construction of additional pre leased developments and may acquire additional properties  which will initially be financed by the credit facility and line of credit 
we will periodically refinance short term construction and acquisition financing with long term debt and or equity 
upon completion of refinancing  we intend to lower the ratio of total debt to market capitalization to or less 
nevertheless  we may operate with debt levels or ratios  which are in excess of for extended periods of time prior to such refinancing 
inflation our leases generally contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on net income 
these provisions include clauses enabling us to pass through to our tenants certain operating costs  including real estate taxes  common area maintenance  utilities and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to cost increases and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
certain of our leases contain clauses enabling us to receive percentage rents based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the term of the leases 
in addition  expiring tenant leases permit us to seek increased rents upon re lease at market rates if rents are below the then existing market rates 
funds from operations we consider funds from operations ffo to be a useful supplemental measure to evaluate our operating performance because  by excluding gains or losses on dispositions and excluding depreciation  ffo can help an investor compare the operating performance of our real estate between periods or compare such performance to that of different companies 
management uses ffo as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using gaap net income by itself as the primary measure of our operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that uses historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself 

table of contents ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit to mean net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
while we adhere to the nareit definition of ffo in making our calculation  our method of calculating ffo may not be comparable to the methods used by other reits and accordingly may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the following table illustrates the calculation of ffo for the years ended december   and year ended december  net income depreciation of real estate assets amortization of leasing costs minority interest gain on sale of assets funds from operations weighted average shares and op units outstanding basic dilutive item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowing activities 
there is inherent roll over risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and our future financing requirements 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal payments in thousands and the weighted average interest rates on remaining debt  by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
thereafter total fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate the fair value in thousands is estimated at  and  for fixed rate debt and variable rate debt  respectively 
the table above incorporates those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or position  which could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates 

table of contents the company does not enter into financial instrument transactions for trading or other speculative purposes or to manage interest rate exposure 
a adverse change in interest rates on the portion of the company s debt bearing interest at variable rates would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately
