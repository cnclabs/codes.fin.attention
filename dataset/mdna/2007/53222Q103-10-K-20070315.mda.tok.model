business segments the company operates in two reportable business segments wholesale and direct to consumer 
the wholesale segment is the company s primary business that designs  markets and distributes household products to retailers and distributors 
the direct to consumer segment is comprised of the company s business that sells household products directly to the consumer through company operated retail outlet stores and catalog and internet operations 
at december   the company operated stores under the farberware brand name and outlet stores under the pfaltzgraff brand name 
the company has segmented its operations in a manner that reflects how management reviews and evaluates the results of its operations 
while both segments distribute similar products  the segments are distinct due to their different types of customers and the different methods used to sell  market and distribute the products in each segment 
net sales for were million  an increase of over net sales of million recorded for net sales for the company s wholesale segment were million  an increase of million or over net sales of million for year over year sales comparisons for the wholesale segment were impacted by acquisitions in and net sales for the pfaltzgraff and salton businesses that were acquired in the third quarter of were million in compared to million in net sales for the syratech business acquired in april were million 
excluding net sales for these acquired businesses  wholesale net sales were million in  higher than net sales of in the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to sales growth in the company s food preparation product category  particularly farberware and kitchenaid branded kitchen tools and gadgets and cusinart and kitchenaid branded cutlery 
net sales for the direct to consumer segment for were million compared to net sales of million for the increase was attributable to a full year of net sales in from the pfaltzgraff outlet stores  catalog and internet operations that were acquired in the third quarter of the company s gross profit margin is subject to fluctuation due primarily to product mix and  in some instances  customer mix 
in  the company s gross profit margin decreased slightly for the wholesale segment due to the impact of the syratech business acquired in april  as syratech s products generally are sold at lower gross profit margins than the average margin of the company s other major product categories 
gross profit margins for the direct to consumer segment increased due primarily to the impact of planned reductions of the aggressive sale promotions that occurred in and to the higher gross profit margins generated by the pfaltzgraff catalog and internet operations that were acquired in the third quarter of seasonality the company s business and working capital needs are highly seasonal  with a majority of sales occurring in the third and fourth quarters 
in  and  net sales for the third and fourth quarters accounted for  and of total annual net sales  respectively 
operating profits earned in the third and fourth quarters of  and accounted for  and of total annual operating profits  respectively 
inventory levels increase primarily in the june through october time period in anticipation of the pre holiday shipping season 
the acquisition of the pfaltzgraff outlet store and catalog and internet operations in july increased the significance of the direct to consumer segment to the company s earnings and significantly increased the seasonality of the company s business 
the increase in seasonality is due to the fact that the sales in the direct to consumer segment are heavily weighted to the holiday shopping season in the latter part of the year and operating expenses  such as salaries and rent  are largely fixed throughout the year 
as a result  the direct to consumer segment recognizes losses in the first half of the year 
sales of the syratech business that the company acquired in april are also heavily weighted toward the second half of the year due to the nature of the products that they sell and  therefore  this business generally incurs operating losses in the first half of the year 
as a result of the foregoing  the company expects that it will report net losses in the first and second quarters of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and with the instructions to form k and article of regulation s x 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company evaluates these estimates including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for sales returns and allowances and customer chargebacks  inventory mark down provisions  impairment of tangible and intangible assets including goodwill and share based compensation 
actual results may differ from these estimates using different assumptions and under different conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described note a to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses its most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
inventory consists principally of finished goods and is priced by the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market method 
inventory cost includes the invoice cost  import duties  freight in costs  warehouse receiving expenses and procurement expenses 
the company periodically reviews and analyzes inventory based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  future product demand for items and estimated profitability of merchandise 
the company sells products wholesale to retailers and distributors and retail direct to the consumer through company operated outlet store  catalog and internet operations 
wholesale sales are recognized when title passes to and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer 
outlet store sales are recognized at the time of sale while catalog and internet sales are recognized upon receipt by the customer 
shipping and handling fees that are billed to customers in sales transactions are recorded in net sales 
the company periodically reviews the collectibility of its accounts receivable and establishes allowances for estimated losses that could result from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required to assess the ultimate realization of these receivables including assessing the credit worthiness of each wholesale customer 
the company also maintains an allowance for sales returns and customer chargebacks 
to evaluate the adequacy of the sales return and customer chargeback allowances the company analyzes currently available information and historical trends 
if the financial conditions of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or the company s estimate of sales returns was determined to be inadequate  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identified net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no  goodwill and other intangible assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
other intangible assets are amortized over their respective useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such amounts may have been impaired 
impairment indicators include among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit or material adverse changes in the business climate that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be impaired 
when impairment indicators are present  the company compares the carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
as of december   no impairment has occurred 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas r requires that the expense resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
sfas r also requires that excess tax benefits associated with share based payments be classified as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows  rather than as operating cash flows as required by previous accounting standards 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
accordingly  the company has not restated prior period amounts 
in  the company accelerated the vesting of all unvested outstanding employee stock options in order to reduce the non cash compensation expense that otherwise would have been required to be recorded under sfas r

the results of operations of the company for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuations 
the company negotiates all of its purchase orders with its foreign manufacturers in united states dollars 
thus  notwithstanding any fluctuations in foreign currencies  the company s cost for a purchase order is generally not subject to change after the time the order is placed 
however  the weakening of the united states dollar against local currencies could lead certain manufacturers to increase their united states dollar prices for products 
the company believes it would be able to compensate for any such price increase
