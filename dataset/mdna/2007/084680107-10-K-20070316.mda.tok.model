item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in this report 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
please see those policies in conjunction with this discussion 
critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes that our most critical accounting policies  which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are as follows allowance for loan losses 
arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
the allowance for loan losses provides for probable estimable losses based upon evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management uses historical information  as well as current economic data  to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
although we believe that we use the appropriate information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary if certain future events occur that cause actual results to differ from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
for 
index example  a downturn in the local economy could cause an increase in non performing loans 
additionally  a decline in real estate values could cause some of our loans to become inadequately collateralized 
in either case  this may require us to increase our provisions for loan losses  which would negatively impact earnings 
the allowance for loan losses discussion in item provides additional information about the allowance 
income taxes 
management considers accounting for income taxes as a critical accounting policy due to the subjective nature of certain estimates that are involved in the calculation and evaluation of the timing and recognition of resulting tax liabilities and assets 
management uses the asset liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
management must assess the realizability of the deferred tax asset  including the carry forward of a portion of the charitable contribution  and to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
adjustments to increase or decrease the valuation allowance are generally charged or credited  respectively  to income tax expense 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
in conjunction with the acquisition of woronoco bancorp in  goodwill was recorded as an intangible asset equal to the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
other intangible assets were recorded for the fair value of core deposits and non compete agreements 
goodwill and intangible assets were recorded for the purchase of insurance agencies in the valuation techniques used by management to determine the carrying value of assets acquired in the acquisition and the estimated lives of identifiable intangible assets involve estimates for discount rates  projected future cash flows and time period calculations  all of which are susceptible to change based on changes in economic conditions and other factors 
future events or changes in the estimates which were used to determine the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets or which otherwise adversely affects their value or estimated lives could have a material adverse impact on future results of operations

total assets were billion at december   increasing by for the year 
total loans increased by for the year to billion  reflecting strong originations in most major categories 
securities available for sale decreased by to million due to the deleveraging and restructuring initiated at the end of the third quarter 
total goodwill and other intangible assets increased by million in due to the acquisition of the insurance agencies in the fourth quarter 
total deposits increased by to billion in  reflecting the benefit of de novo branch expansion and organic growth 
securities sales proceeds were used to pay down borrowings  which decreased by to million 
the increase in stockholders equity to million primarily reflected retained earnings and proceeds from stock option exercises 
investment securities 
total investment securities decreased by million in at the end of the third quarter  the company changed its intent to hold certain available for sale securities with a fair value of approximately million 
due to unusually large migrations of deposit balances from transaction and savings accounts to money market and time deposits  the company faced growing liability interest rate sensitivity  higher funding costs  and a narrower net interest margin 
the higher cost of interest sensitive borrowings also resulted in a larger negative spread on older securities with lower book yields 
management determined that a securities portfolio repositioning would help mitigate these issues 
the million of securities sold were mostly intermediate term mortgage backed securities 
proceeds were used primarily to pay down borrowings  and secondarily to fund additional loan growth in the fourth quarter 
this action was taken to improve future income and to improve management s flexibility in managing the investment portfolio 
the average book yield on the million of securities chosen for the repositioning was approximately 
the remaining portfolio of available for sale intermediate term mortgage backed securities is expected to contribute to earnings  liquidity  and asset liability objectives 
the company has the ability and intent to hold these securities 
the repositioning of these securities resulted in a net securities loss of million 
the loss on these securities was already recorded in stockholders equity  so this transaction had no negative impact on stockholders equity 
the total unrealized loss on securities available for sale was million at mid year this loss had increased from million at year end due to the impact of higher interest rates  which caused debt securities prices to decline 
in the third quarter  medium term interest rates declined  which led to improved securities prices 
after recording the 
index million loss related to the securities repositioning  the remaining available for sale securities had a net unrealized gain of thousand at year end 
securities purchases for the year consisted primarily of locally originated industrial revenue bonds and other local municipal securities 
the bank decreased its holdings of fhlbb stock by million to million due to the impact of changes in the capital policies of the fhlb system 
in each quarter of  the bank recorded securities gains related primarily to the sale of equity securities 
the company had liquidated substantially all of its portfolio of exchange traded equity securities at the end of the year at year end  the total investment securities portfolio of million included million of municipal bonds and obligations  million of mortgage backed securities  federal home loan bank stock of million  and million of other securities which consisted primarily of trust preferred securities 
securities with repricings over five years totaled million at year end  which was down from million at the prior year end due to the portfolio restructuring 
the fully taxable equivalent yield on investment securities increased to in the fourth quarter of from in the same quarter of this reflected part of the benefit of the securities restructuring in the fourth quarter  along with the benefit of longer term municipal securities added during the year 
loans 
total loans increased by million in most major categories of loans increased during the year 
total commercial loans increased by million for the year due to strong originations in all regions 
commercial loans equaled of total loans at year end commercial loans are the chief focus of the bank s lending strategy  and the bank feels it has a strong competitive advantage in this market as a locally headquartered regional bank 
the majority of commercial loan volume was originated in the new york region which is centered in albany and is the largest commercial market in which the bank operates 
commercial loans also grew at a strong pace in the bank s massachusetts markets 
loan growth benefited from the new leadership and lending teams that the bank has assembled in its new regions in the pioneer valley and new york 
commercial loan growth was concentrated in a million increase in commercial construction loans and an million increase in other commercial mortgages 
the annualized pace of commercial loan growth slowed to in the fourth quarter and the company anticipates slower growth in due to the impact of interest rates on loan demand and margins 
the company is focusing on its process of customer and product selection  and is emphasizing shorter term credits where it has a competitive advantage compared to larger financial institutions 
the company also expects to utilize loan participations and secondary market conduits to broaden and diversify its credit offerings 
the company also recorded increases of million in residential permanent mortgages and million in indirect auto loans  and these areas also benefited from the company s larger regional footprint and a new auto loan conduit 
the bank does not offer subprime loan programs 
the company had small declines in residential construction  commercial single and multi family  and home equity loans 
this related primarily to less demand due to slowing housing markets and to the impact of higher interest rates  particularly since most of the company s consumer real estate lending products are adjustable rate 
the company generally sells its originations of fixed rate residential mortgages to secondary market investors on a flow basis 
the company is developing new consumer credit initiatives for  including enhancement of residential lending programs and faster turnarounds of other consumer loan products 
loans with repricings over five years totaled million at year end  which was an increase of million over the million total at year end this increase reflected demand for longer term fixed rates following two years of rising short term rates 
the million increase in loans repricing over five years was offset by a million decrease in loans repricing in years  as well as the million decrease in securities repricing over five years 
the average yield on loans increased to in the fourth quarter of from in the fourth quarter of this reflected the increase in the prime rate during the year and higher rates on loan originations following two years of rate increases 
residential mortgage yields showed the least increase  rising to from 
commercial business loans had the highest yield of and the largest increase of since most of these loans are tied to prime 
asset quality 
most measures of asset quality were favorable at the end of net loan charge offs were of total average loans for the year year end delinquencies days measured of total loans at year end  compared to at the prior year end 
total year end non performing assets measured of total assets  and there was no other real estate owned 
these non performing assets included a secured commercial loan totaling million of assets which became non accruing during the fourth quarter 
a specific reserve of 
index million was assigned to this relationship at year end  and management was actively pursuing collection 
all other year end non performing assets measured of total assets 
non performing assets at the prior year end were of total assets 
loan loss allowance 
management increased the loan loss allowance from million at year end to million at december  the loan loss allowance was increased primarily based on management s assessment of higher loan losses inherent in the portfolio at september  the allowance also increased due to higher pool reserves related to higher loan outstandings and to higher reserves on impaired loans 
the ratio of the allowance to total loans increased from to during the allowance was increased in the third quarter to of total loans based on higher general pool reserves  reflecting management s analysis that loan losses would increase above the negligible levels of recent years due to signs in the third quarter of an economic slowing 
of the total million increase in the allowance in  million of this increase was related to the third quarter adjustment to increase general pool reserve levels due to a higher percentage of inherent losses in the portfolio 
management has viewed both the company s and the industry s recent loan loss experience as unusually favorable due to a combination of economic factors including generally low interest rates  fiscal stimulus  and a strong real estate market that had increasingly been described as a bubble by various observers 
in the absence of countervailing indicators  the loan loss allowance has reflected these historically low loss rates 
during the third quarter  management determined that there were specific events in the quarter which indicated that economic conditions were becoming less supportive  and that the credit risks in its environment had shifted from the unusually benign conditions which have predominated in recent years 
the most prominent change was the pronounced slowdown in residential real estate markets in the third quarter  as evidenced in part by the commerce department report on september home prices 
this report showed that the year to year decline in median home prices was the largest drop in thirty five years 
while a significant portion of the company s loan portfolio is secured by residential real estate  management s primary focus on residential real estate relates to its function as perhaps the chief driver of economic growth in recent years 
management reasoned that  like a plant closing which is expected to produce loan losses in the future  the sudden deceleration of this key economic indicator has resulted in higher probable loan losses in the company s loan portfolio 
these losses are viewed as chiefly inherent in the commercial loan portfolio  where cash flows and collateral values are viewed as more sensitive to economic fluctuations 
an economic slowdown is expected to result in higher probable loan losses because business cash flows are generally the primary source of loan repayments and management believes that some business cash flows decline as a result of an overall softening of the economy 
also during the third quarter  the federal reserve bank the fed suspended interest rate increases after seventeen consecutive hikes over the last two years  a further sign of economic slowing 
management s review of historic economic data led it to conclude that an economic slowing was highly likely to follow the suspension of a sustained period of tightening by the fed  and that such economic slowing increased losses inherent in the portfolio 
an additional third quarter event was the combined impact of higher rates  higher prices  and higher energy costs on loan repayment sources 
the prime interest rate climbed above at the start of the quarter and management viewed this as a significant threshold  particularly following generally low interest rates only two years ago 
higher prices and spiking energy costs in the third quarter also contributed to a probable tightening of debt service ability by both retail and commercial borrowers 
additionally  the company noted that commercial appraisals were beginning to reflect higher capitalization rates due to both higher interest rates and higher equity spreads expected by investors 
as a result  management determined that it was probable that both cash flows and real estate values will provide less credit protection in the current environment and that higher loan losses are therefore probable 
based on these events  the company re evaluated its loan loss methodology related to pools of performing loans in order to reasonably estimate the range of probable loan losses inherent in such pools 
management reviewed all of the major loan pools on a pool by pool basis 
primary emphasis was given to commercial loans because of historic experience that these loans are most sensitive to economic and real estate market conditions and have the highest potential annual loss rate 
management considered relevant historic periods during the last two decades that were characterized by economic slowing  declining real estate values  and higher interest rates  and assessed related loan loss data for each of the loan pools 
management considered both the company s historical loan loss data and fdic 
index historical loan loss data pertaining to commercial banks with assets ranging from billion to billion to assess ranges of loan loss estimates 
the company also considered other factors on a pool by pool basis which might be relevant to probable loan losses  such as current trends in loan performance  risk ratings  regional conditions  product mix  and the increasing size of individual loans being originated 
for each major loan pool  the company analyzed the average life of the loan pool and the probable rate of loan losses over that period based on the above factors 
the company established a reserve amount for each of the loan pools based on these analyses  with each pool reserve amount being based on the product of the average pool life and the probable rate of losses 
the average pool lives of the various pools ranged between two and four years and were viewed as consistent with the expected loss emergence patterns based on management s estimates of losses inherent in the pools on the balance sheet dates 
the reserve on commercial real estate was set at of outstanding loans based on an estimate of annual losses approximating of average loans 
the reserve on commercial construction and development loans was set at based on an annual loss estimate approximating of average loans 
the reserve on commercial business loans was set at based on an annual loss estimate approximating of average loans 
the combined pool reserves on all commercial loans equated to of outstanding commercial loans at september   compared to at year end the reserve on residential mortgage loans was set at based on an annual loss estimate approximating of average loans 
the reserve on total consumer loans was set at based on an annual loss estimate approximating of average loans 
in addition to specific pool reserves  the company maintains an unallocated reserve which reflects uncertainties in the estimation process 
pool reserves were adjusted slightly in the fourth quarter based on current loan originations and on loss emergence trends in the quarter 
the unallocated reserve was set at an amount equal to of total loans at year end in addition to the general reserves  the loan loss allowance also included a reserve for impaired loans which totaled thousand at year end 
other assets 
the net book value of premises increased due primarily to the de novo branching program in the company s new york market 
goodwill and other intangible assets increased due to the acquisition of five insurance agencies 
all other assets increased primarily due to equity investments in community and historic development entities which provide transferable tax credits utilized by the company 
deposits 
total deposits increased by million in excluding planned runoff of brokered time deposits  total deposits increased by million 
the de novo branch program in new york generated million in deposit growth  with total new york deposits increasing to million at year end deposit growth in the massachusetts branches measured  including growth in the recently acquired pioneer valley deposits and growth in berkshire county deposits 
deposit growth was centered in higher yielding money market accounts and time deposits 
balances declined in the other deposit categories as customers shifted funds into the higher yielding accounts in reaction to the rising interest rates in and time deposits with maturities over three years declined to million at year end from million at the start of the year reflecting higher demand and competition for shorter maturity structures following two years of interest rate hikes 
the cost of interest bearing deposits increased to in the fourth quarter of from in the same quarter of  as both money market and time deposit costs increased by about over this period due to the impact of rate hikes in and the bank s strategy is to promote lower cost transaction accounts  along with money market accounts which can be tied to other relationship banking 
with this strategy  the bank has also enhanced its commercial payment services and municipal account solicitation in order to broaden its footprint and improve cross sales with loan and insurance products 
after year end  the bank unveiled its i m so excited branding initiative and implemented new goals and incentives for increasing the pool of customers and products 
borrowings 
total borrowings decreased by million during due to the reduction of fhlbb borrowings with funds provided from the securities restructuring and deleveraging at the end of the third quarter 
during  the bank borrowed million in fhlbb term advances over one year 
these maturities were generally in the year range and were used to fund growth of intermediate term loans 
most of these advances were bullet advances without optional calls 
total year end borrowings over three years declined to million from million  as the bank favored maturities of three years and under to fund loan growth 
borrowings maturing under a year decreased to million at year end from million at the prior year end 
short term borrowings had been used to partially fund loan growth during the year  and then were significantly paid down with proceeds from the securities restructuring at the end of the third quarter 
borrowings in also included a million short term note payable at the holding company which was used to provide partial funding for the insurance agency acquisitions 
the cost of borrowings increased to 
index in the fourth quarter of from in the same quarter of this cost rose due to rate hikes  but benefited in the fourth quarter from the reduction in overnight borrowings with proceeds from the investment restructuring 
equity 
total stockholders equity increased by million to million at year end from million at year end this included the benefit of million in earnings less million in dividends and million in stock repurchases

there were  shares of treasury stock repurchased and there were  shares issued for option exercises and stock grants 
outstanding shares increased by  to  the company paid cash dividends of per share in each of the four quarters in the ratio of stockholders equity to total assets decreased slightly to at year end from at the end of the ratio of tangible stockholders equity to total assets decreased to from due to the purchase of the insurance agencies 
book value per share increased to from in the bank met all regulatory capital requirements and continued to satisfy the conditions necessary to be classified as well capitalized in accordance with federal regulatory standards 
the bank s risk based capital decreased to from during due to loan growth and dividends totaling million paid to the holding company  including the stock of berkshire insurance group  which was contributed to the holding company in conjunction with the insurance agency acquisitions in the fourth quarter 
because the bank s dividends exceeded retained earnings from recent operations in accordance with certain regulatory measurements  the bank s dividends to the company in required specific regulatory approval 
such dividends in the immediate future would also require specific regulatory approval 
the bank has applied for approval to pay million in dividends to the company in this application has been approved by the massachusetts department of banking and the bank is waiting for approval from the office of thrift supervision 
such payment is subject to various conditions  including that the bank maintain its well capitalized classification after factoring in the payment 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and net income 
net income increased by to million in  compared to million in the prior year 
net income in included third quarter charges related to a million loss on the securities portfolio restructuring and a million adjustment of loan loss allowance pool reserve levels 
net income in also included total costs of million for the new york de novo branch program  which the company views as an investment in franchise expansion 
the return on average assets for the year was 
before the above charges  which total million in the aggregate million after adjusting for taxes at a tax rate  income was million which represented a return of approximately on assets 
the return on average equity was for the year  and the return before the above charges was approximately 
results in also included non cash charges of million for the amortization of intangible assets 
before these additional charges  the return on equity was approximately  which the company regards as a measure of its ongoing cash return on invested capital before its investment in franchise expansion 
most major categories of income and expense increased in compared to due to the full year benefit of the woronoco acquisition  along with expansion and organic growth 
total net revenue 
total net revenue consists of net interest income and non interest income 
total net revenue increased by million in excluding net securities losses of million in and gains of million in  total net revenue increased by million due to acquisitions  de novo expansion  and organic growth 
excluding securities gains and losses  total net revenue per diluted share was in  increasing by from in the prior year 
including securities gains and losses  this measure was and in and  respectively 
net interest income 
net interest income increased by million to million in compared to average earning assets increased by due to higher loan balances 
this favorable volume variance was offset by an unfavorable rate variance  as the net interest margin decreased to in from in due to the impact of the flat yield curve and deposit balance shifts towards higher cost accounts 
this margin tightening produced an unfavorable rate variance of approximately million  which was offset by the benefit of the strong increase in average loans which produced a positive volume variance of approximately million to fully taxable equivalent net interest income 

index the federal reserve bank completed the final interest rate hike in a series of seventeen sequential interest rate hikes over a two year period ending at mid year short term interest rates increased by during the first half of the year and then remained constant through year end 
the year end federal funds rate was and the prime rate was 
the ten year treasury rate increased by approximately to over the course of the year  peaking around at mid year 
the yield curve was inverted for much of the year  with short term rates exceeding long term rates 
the company had modest liability sensitivity at the end of which was expected to produce a decrease in the net interest margin based on a increase in rates  but the margin decreased by due to the aforementioned flat yield curve and deposit mix shifts 
the net interest margin decreased from in the fourth quarter of to in the second quarter of and then rebounded to in the fourth quarter of fourth quarter net interest income included some of the benefit of the securities restructuring 
this was partially offset by borrowings to fund the insurance agency acquisitions 
seasonal time account repricings  narrower commercial loan spreads  and a continuing negative yield curve were expected to push the net interest margin towards in in order to combat these margin pressures  the bank intended to promote low cost transaction accounts and to continue to emphasize commercial loan originations which are its highest yielding assets 
balance sheet average balances reflected the full year benefit of the woronoco bancorp acquisition in june the average balances of the major loan categories generally increased throughout  increasing by for the year compared to securities average balances decreased gradually during the year and then fell sharply in the fourth quarter due to the portfolio restructuring 
for the year  the average balance declined by 
deposit balances increased throughout the year  with the yearly average increasing by over now and savings account balances trended down during the year due to the migration of balances into higher yield and faster growing money market and time deposit accounts 
average demand deposit accounts declined in the first two quarters but then increased at an annualized rate in the second half of  producing yearly growth of compared to average borrowings declined in the first half of the year  increased in the third quarter due to the strong loan growth in the second quarter  and then declined in the fourth quarter due to the deleveraging related to the securities portfolio restructuring 
average borrowings decreased by for the year 
average equity increased by for the year due primarily to the full year impact of the equity issued in conjunction with the woronoco acquisition 
all major categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities produced higher yields and costs in due to the cumulative impact of increasing interest rates over the last two years except for savings costs which were flat year to year 
several categories have contracted future repricings which will produce additional increases based on current interest rate levels 
commercial business loans  money market deposit accounts  and time deposits have the most sensitivity to rate changes and the quarterly average rates in these three categories increased in the range of due to the increase in short term rates in residential mortgages and savings accounts showed the least sensitivity  with quarterly average rates increasing by less than 
the average interest spread decreased by approximately to in from in the decrease in the net interest margin was less than the decrease in the spread due to the benefit from growth in non interest bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings in an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level deemed adequate by the company 
the level of the allowance is a critical accounting estimate  which is subject to uncertainty 
the level of the allowance was included in the discussion of financial condition 
the loan loss provision totaled million for the year  compared to million in the year s provision included approximately million related to the third quarter increase in the pool reserves as a result of the higher inherent losses due to economic changes 
the year s provision also increased due to loan growth and higher impairment reserves 
net loan charge offs were million of average loans in  compared to million of average loans in the prior year 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased by million to million in compared to million in this was due to a million swing from securities gains to securities losses  which the company does not view as part of its basic operating income 
all other non interest income increased by million 
this increase primarily reflected the benefit of fee income from acquisitions and organic growth 
deposit fee income increased by million  insurance fee income increased by million  and wealth management fee income increased by million 
fourth quarter insurance fee income increased by million in compared to due to two months revenues from insurance agencies acquired at the end of october 
index on a proforma basis  assuming that the agencies had been acquired at the beginning of and excluding securities gains and losses  proforma non interest income measured of total proforma net revenue  compared to an historic ratio of in including securities gains and losses  this measure was and in and  respectively 
the company is strategically emphasizing growth of fee income sources both to enhance cross sales in its pool of customers and products  and to reduce its reliance on net interest income which may continue to be impacted by tighter margins based on competitive industry conditions 
the company recorded gross securities losses of million in due primarily to the securities portfolio restructuring in the third quarter 
gross losses of million were recorded in in relation to a deleveraging in the first half  in connection with the woronoco bancorp acquisition 
the company recorded gross securities gains of million in which were primarily related to the sale of equity securities 
the company had recorded million in securities gains in which were also mostly related to equity securities sales 
as of the end of  the company had substantially liquidated its portfolio of equity securities and no further significant equity securities gains were expected to be recorded 
all other non interest income increased to million in from million in this income was primarily related to increases in cash surrender value of life insurance  and the increase in was primarily related to life insurance death benefits received 
non interest expense 
total non interest expense was essentially unchanged in compared to  with increases related to growth  branch expansion  and acquisitions offset by the impact of the one time non cash million charge for the esop termination in excluding the esop termination charge  total non interest expense increased by million in this increase included approximately million in higher new york expansion charges  which totaled million for the de novo branch program for these charges are viewed by the company as an investment in franchise expansion

all other categories of expense increased due to the acquisitions  de novo branching  and organic growth 
total full time equivalent staff increased by to at year end from at the prior year end  primarily due to the staff of the insurance agencies acquired in the fourth quarter 
while the company has significantly expanded its loan origination activities  much of the impact on expenses has been offset by higher deferrals of loan origination related expenses  these deferrals increased by million in compared to the company s strategy continues to emphasize the realization of efficiencies from expanded operations  targeted programs developed in the company s six sigma process improvement discipline  and ongoing expense controls 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million in from million in and is scheduled to increase to million in due to the insurance agency acquisitions 
the company evaluates its profitability both including and excluding this non cash charge which is related to acquisitions of relationships which are expected to provide ongoing value beyond the period of the related deposit and insurance contracts which comprise the majority of intangible assets and related amortization 
the ratio of non interest expense to total assets decreased to in from in the prior year 
income tax expense and income from discontinued operations 
the effective tax rate for was 
the effective tax rate in was due to the non deductibility of most of the esop termination charge 
excluding this charge  the effective tax rate was approximately in the improvement in the effective tax rate included a benefit of approximately compared to pre tax income which was related to a higher average balance of municipal securities in results for the second and third quarters of also included income from discontinued operations from the sale of the company s data processing subsidiary in june the company does not expect to record additional income or expense from these discontinued operations 
comprehensive income

comprehensive income includes changes in accumulated other comprehensive income  which consist primarily of changes after tax in the unrealized market gains and losses of investment securities available for sale 
the company recorded comprehensive income of million in compared to million in results in included the impact of a million unrealized loss on available for sale investment securities due to higher interest rates 
results in included a million unrealized gain which remained after the realization of million in net securities losses through the income statement 

index comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and net income 
net income for was million  compared to million in results in included a non cash charge of million for the termination of the esop 
this charge had no negative impact on stockholders equity due to offsetting credits to unearned compensation and additional paid in capital 
diluted earnings per share totaled in  compared to in net interest income 
net interest income increased by million  due to the balance sheet growth related primarily to the acquired assets and liabilities of woronoco 
the net interest margin fully taxable equivalent decreased to from  including the impact of the woronoco acquisition and deleveraging 
the primary impact of market conditions was the flattening of the interest rate yield curve  which narrowed the marginal earnings spread on many asset liability combinations 
the flattening of the yield curve was due to a steady increase in short term rates during the year  with a much smaller increase in long term rates 
the increase in short term rates benefited the bank s interest sensitive assets  but also produced significant competition for deposits  which had fallen to very low rates in recent years 
the net impact of these market conditions was unfavorable  and management sought to mitigate this by promoting transaction deposit accounts and relationship deposit offerings  and also by continuing to focus on commercial loan growth 
the decline in the net interest margin also included a annualized impact from the purchase of bank owned life insurance in the fourth quarter of due to rising interest rates  both asset yields and liability costs increased during the bank was modestly liability sensitive at the end of  reflecting the effect of higher optionality in the woronoco balance sheet under the higher interest rate conditions prevailing at the end of provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was million in  compared to million in net loan charge offs were at a five year low in  and the ratio of net charge offs to average loans declined to a relatively low in the provision measured of net charge offs in  compared to in the prior year 
non interest income 
non interest income increased by million in compared to this increase was primarily due to the addition of the woronoco contribution beginning on june  together with higher securities gains and organic revenue growth 
service fee income totaled million for the year  and measured of average assets  compared to of average assets in the previous year 
about half of the improvement in this ratio was due to growth in insurance commissions and loan servicing fees  and this growth was directly tied to the woronoco acquisition 
additionally  woronoco had a larger residential mortgage loan servicing portfolio 
the other half of the improvement in this ratio was primarily due to growth in overdraft fees  as was the first full year of operations of the bank s courtesy overdraft protection program

the company estimated that total cost savings and integration efficiencies 
index related to the woronoco acquisition equated to about of woronoco s first quarter non interest expense  excluding merger related charges 
these cost savings exceeded the company s original objective for cost savings 
expenses in included thousand in operating costs of new branches and expanded commercial lending

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet cash needs at all times with available cash or by conversion of other assets to cash at a reasonable price 
the primary source of funding for the company is dividend payments from the bank and from berkshire insurance group 
additional sources of liquidity are proceeds from borrowings and capital offerings  and from stock option exercises 
the main uses of liquidity are the payment of stockholder dividends  purchases of treasury stock  debt service on outstanding borrowings and debentures  and the cash portion of business acquisitions 
there are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends as discussed in the stockholders equity note to the consolidated financial statements 
the bank s primary source of liquidity is customer deposits 
additional sources are borrowings  repayments of loans and investment securities  and the sale and repayments of investment securities 
the bank closely monitors its liquidity position on a daily basis 
sources of borrowings include advances from the fhlbb and a repurchase agreement line of credit with a nationally recognized broker dealer 
the greatest sources of uncertainty affecting liquidity are deposit withdrawals and usage of loan commitments  which are influenced by interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
the bank relies on competitive rates  customer service  and long standing relationships with customers to manage deposit and loan liquidity 
based on its historical experience  management believes that it has adequately provided for deposit and loan liquidity needs 
both liquidity and capital resources are managed according to policies approved by the board of directors 
the bank must satisfy various regulatory capital requirements  which are discussed in the regulation and supervision section of item and in the stockholders equity note to the consolidated financial statements 
at year end  the company was engaged in its eight stock repurchase program as further described in item please see the equity section of the discussion of financial condition for additional information about liquidity and capital at year end in september  the company filed a universal shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission for the issuance of up to million in debt securities  common stock  or preferred stock 
there were no securities issued pursuant to this registration at year end 
index contractual obligations 
the year end contractual obligations were as follows less than one one to three three to five after five in thousands total year years years years fhlbb borrowings junior subordinated debentures operating lease obligations note payable equity contribution commitments purchase obligations total contractual obligations further information about borrowings and lease obligations is contained in notes and in the financial statements 
equity contribution commitments are primarily related to community and historic development entities with transferable tax credits 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of operations  the company engages in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not recorded in the company s financial instruments 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit 
a further presentation of the company s off balance sheet arrangements is presented in note  commitments  contingencies  and off balance sheet activities in the notes to the financial statements 
for  the company did not engage in any off balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operation or cash flows 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented in this form k have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of berkshire bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on berkshire bank s performance than the general level of inflation 
interest rates may be affected by inflation  but the direction and magnitude of the impact may vary 
a sudden change in inflation or expectations about inflation  with a related change in interest rates  would have a significant impact on our operations 
impact of new accounting pronouncements please refer to the note on recent accounting pronouncements in note to the financial statements for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk and market risk analysis qualitative aspects of market risk 
the bank s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
the bank seeks to avoid fluctuations in its net interest income and to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk through periods of changing interest rates 
berkshire bank maintains an asset liability committee that is responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position 
this committee meets at least quarterly and reports trends and interest rate risk position to the risk management committee and board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the company s earnings 
the bank has managed interest rate risk by emphasizing assets with shorter term repricing durations  periodically selling long term fixed rate assets  promoting low cost core deposits  and using fhlbb advances to structure its liability repricing durations 

index quantitative aspects of market risk 
berkshire hills uses a simulation model to measure the potential change in net interest income that an instantaneous increase or decrease of market interest rates would cause assuming a simultaneous parallel shift along the entire yield curve 
loans  deposits and borrowings were expected to reprice at the new repricing or maturity date 
the company uses prepayment guidelines set forth by market sources as well as company generated data where applicable 
cash flows from loans and securities are assumed to be reinvested based on current operating conditions and strategies 
other assumptions about balance sheet mix are generally held constant 
however  in addition to the instantaneous interest rate shock simulation model previously disclosed  the company has regularly utilized other types of analyses in assessing its interest rate sensitivities 
while primary emphasis was given to the rate shock model in the past  the company has also periodically utilized a rate change ramp simulation model  which modeled the impact of interest rate changes which were ramped evenly over a twelve month period  rather than as an instantaneous shock 
emphasis was previously placed on the shock model in part due to the generational low levels of interest rates and the anticipation of a future rebound 
in recent periods  the federal reserve bank has raised interest rates on a ramped basis and the company now views the ramp model as more relevant for assessing the risk of the current and anticipated interest rate environments 
accordingly  the simulation results presented below are for a twelve month ramped interest rate change  and the year end results have also been changed to reflect this assumption 
additionally  the model has been extended to include a second simulated year in order to fully assess the impact of changes which were ramped in the first year 
no other material changes have been made to the methodologies used in the model 
when comparing the year end rate shock sensitivity as reported in the form k to the ramp rate change scenario shown above  there is no material change in the assessment of overall interest rate sensitivity of the bank 
change in interest rates basis months months points rate ramp change change change change dollars in thousands at december  at december  at year end  the company displayed a modestly negative income sensitivity to higher interest rates liability sensitivity due to shifts in the deposit mix to money market deposits and to shorter duration time accounts and due to the growth of loans with intermediate term pricing durations 
the company s liability sensitivity also increased due to lower prepayments of loans and investments as a result of higher prevailing interest rates 
due to the company s growth plans  these factors are anticipated to continue to influence potential changes in the company s interest rate risk in future periods 
the company is using some longer term borrowings and is considering promoting certain longer term time accounts 
the securities deleveraging at the end of the third quarter of helped to reduce liability sensitivity 
the sale of the interest rate swaps hedging certain brokered time deposits subsequent to year end also reduced liability sensitivity 
the company would consider other financial instruments to partially offset further liability sensitivity related to loan and deposit growth 
the company believes that short term rates may be near a peak and it is willing to accept some moderate liability sensitivity in support of its overall strategic objectives 

index due to the limitations and uncertainties relating to model assumptions  these computations should not be relied on as projections of income 
further  the computations do not reflect any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the most significant assumption relates to expectations for the interest sensitivity of non maturity deposit accounts in a rising rate environment 
the model assumes that deposit rate sensitivity will be a percentage of the market interest rate change as follows now accounts ranging between and depending on product type  money market accounts ranging between and depending on the balance and product type  and savings accounts at the prior year end 
one of the significant limitations of the simulation is that it assumes parallel shifts in the yield curve 
actual interest rate risks are often more complex than this scenario 
a key interest rate change in was the inverting of the yield curve  which generated downward pressure on net interest income 
assumption changes in were based on a review of past performance and future expectations and were not viewed as material
