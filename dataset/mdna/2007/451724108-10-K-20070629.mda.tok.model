company overview we sell our software solutions to large and medium sized corporations inside and outside of the fortune we market our products using a direct sales force and a distribution channel consisting of agents  distributors  value added resellers and oem partners 
we allow customers to choose between purchasing a perpetual license and subscribing to a term license  thereby providing flexibility in pricing and payment methods 
our revenues are derived from a mixture of sales of licenses of software  monthly recurring revenues from annual maintenance  hosting and support agreements and from audio conferencing products and services 
our web collaboration software is sold on a perpetual license or periodic license basis 
a customer may choose to acquire a one time perpetual license the purchase model or may rent our software on a periodic basis on either a per seat  per month or per minute basis the subscription model 
should the customer choose to acquire the software using the purchase model  then it may either elect to host our software behind its own firewall or it may choose to have ilinc host it for the customer  depending upon the customer s preferences  budget and it capabilities 
customers who select the purchase model  whether hosted by ilinc or the customer  may also subscribe for ongoing customer support and maintenance and software upgrade services  by entering into a support and maintenance contract with a term from one to five years 
the annual maintenance and support fee charged is initially based upon a percentage of the purchase price that varies between and of the license fee paid for the perpetual licenses  with the percentage depending upon the contractual length and the timing of payment of the annual maintenance and support agreement 
if a customer chooses to have ilinc host its purchase model licenses  then the customer is also charged an annual hosting fee equal to of the purchase model license fee that was paid for the perpetual license 
during fiscal  ilinc launched its enterprise unlimited perpetual licensing model that enables customers to pay a one time up front fee for unlimited  organization wide web conferencing  as well as a named user model that permits a host to subscribe for a limited use room 
those customers who qualify for the ilinc enterprise unlimited site license may subscribe to an unlimited use license 
the initial ilinc enterprise unlimited license fee is determined based upon the number of employees within the customer s organization and various other factors 
the annual maintenance and support fees and hosting fees associated with an ilinc enterprise unlimited license are then based upon a fixed price or upon an associated rate per seat license that is active on each annual anniversary of the ilinc enterprise unlimited license agreement 
customers may expand the number of active seats available to them at any time with a corresponding increase in annual maintenance and hosting fees being charged 
customers choosing the subscription model pay a fee per seat concurrent connection on either a per month or per year basis depending upon the length and term of the subscription agreement 
hosting and maintenance are included as a part of the monthly or annual rental fees 
customers may also obtain web conferencing and audio conferencing on a per minute basis using the ilinc on demand product 
those choosing the ilinc on demand product pay on a monthly basis typically without contractual commitment 
in addition to the web conferencing and audio conferencing products and services  we offer custom content development services through a subcontractor relationship and an off the shelf online library of content includes an online mini mba program co developed with the tuck school of business at dartmouth college 
these other services are a small portion of our overall revenue base and will likely phase out as an offered service over the next three years 
performance measures and indicators in evaluating our operating performance  we consider levels of revenues  gross profit  operating income and net income to be important indicators 
over the past three fiscal years  we have succeeded in increasing revenues at a faster rate than our cost of revenues and operating expenses 
therefore  while revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses all have increased during this period  total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues each have decreased over the past three fiscal years 
our goal is for this trend to continue as we seek to manage increases in expenses at the same time we seek to increase revenues 
in evaluating our liquidity  we evaluate levels of current assets  current liabilities and accounts receivable  aging of accounts receivable and maturities of debt and obligations under long term leases 
our levels of current assets  including accounts receivable  at march  were significantly higher than our levels of current assets at march   while our current liabilities at march  were approximately  less than our level of current liabilities at march  as a result  we had working capital of  at march  compared to a working capital deficit of million at march  our accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  were million and million at march  and march   respectively 
accounts receivable increased  which was consistent with increased revenues when comparing fiscal to fiscal the aging of receivables has remained consistent when comparing march  to march   with accounts receivable under days making up and of the total receivable balance  respectively 
as indicated below  in the table under the caption contractual obligations at march  long term debt due in less than one year  capital lease obligations due in less than one year  interest expense for the coming year and operating lease obligations for the coming year aggregated   million and  respectively 
we anticipate that cash flow from operations should be sufficient to allow us to meet these obligations without raising additional capital 
as indicators of future financial performance  our management evaluates current number of seats concurrent license sold  average sales price per transaction  average sales cycle  quota achievement by the direct sales staff  the number of current transactions  the average sales amount per transaction  the percentage each product sold contributes to total revenue and the trends indicated by these factors 
external factors that our management considers in analyzing our performance include projected growth rates for our industry  rates of penetration of use of our product categories in the corporate sector and telecommunications growth and rate structures 
we consider these factors important since they permit us to better project capital needs and growth trends that support our assertions of profitability and cash flow 
analysis of these trends indicates that we are having increasing success from our direct sales staff  with that success is likely to translate into increasing revenue and an increasing bottom line should overhead trends remain consistent with historical patterns 
we expect overhead to remain relatively flattened  except for incremental increases in sales and marketing costs associated and in proportion to revenue growth 
we see increasing demand for audio conferencing and web conferencing usage in the business  education and government sectors alike  and we expect these trends to continue over the next three years 
the following table shows certain items from our income statement as a percentage of revenues

results of operations revenues from continuing operations total revenues generated from continuing operations for the months ended march  fiscal and march  fiscal were million and million  respectively  an increase of million or 
software license revenues increased million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  as the result of agreements with oem licensing fees and channel sales of  and off the shelf courseware of  in addition  direct sales increased by  as a result of an increase in the number of licenses and the price per license sold 
subscription and audio services revenues increased  or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  as the result of increased audio per minute usage of  and an increase in hosting revenues of  which are driven by increases in license sales year on year and sustaining the customer base 
maintenance and professional services revenues increased  or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  as the result of an increase in maintenance fees of  from renewals as the customer base continues to grow 
in addition  we recognized an increase in training  storage and recording revenues of  the increases were partially offset by a decrease in our custom content revenues of  this is a variable component of our revenues related to work performed by our subcontractor  interactive alchemy 
for fiscal  software license revenues were of total revenue  subscription and audio services revenues were of total revenue and maintenance and professional services revenues were of total revenue  as compared to  and  respectively  for fiscal we expect software license revenues and indirect subscription license revenue to continue to become a larger percentage of total revenues as total revenues increase given our focus on the software purchase model and indirect sales model 
we expect sales from custom content services and off the shelf license sales decline 
total revenues from continuing operations generated for fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively  an increase of million or 
software license revenues decreased  or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as the result of a reduction in non core off the shelf sales 
subscription and audio services revenue increased million or from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal  as a result of recognition of audio services revenue for a full months as opposed to ten months in fiscal as the result of the glyphics transaction 
maintenance and professional services revenue increased  or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  as the result of an increase in license revenue 
since maintenance and hosting revenues are sold with license sales  increases in license revenue will cause a proportionate increase in maintenance revenue  a trend we expect to continue as license revenues rise 
for fiscal  software license revenues were of total revenue  subscription and audio services revenues were of total revenue and maintenance and professional services revenue were of total revenues  as compared to  and  respectively  for fiscal cost of revenues from continuing operations cost of software license revenues is driven by the types of software licenses sold 
it consists of royalty fees paid on certain off the shelf products  if any  sold  and sales rebates to distribution partners on the sale of certain software products 
cost of software license revenues for fiscal and fiscal were  and  respectively  an increase of  or 
the increase was related to an increase in royalty fees arising from the sale of certain off the shelf courseware 
cost of software license revenue was approximately of total revenues in fiscal and approximately of total revenues in fiscal we expect the cost of software license revenues to remain a very small percentage of total license revenue  which will arise only from royalties which may be due from the sale of off the shelf courseware 
cost of software license revenues for fiscal and fiscal were  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
the decrease is related to a decrease in third party usage fees for the company s non core off the shelf product 
cost of software license revenue was approximately of total revenues in fiscal and approximately of total revenues in fiscal we expect the cost of revenue for license sales to remain a very small fraction of license revenue that is not likely to exceed 
cost of subscription and audio services revenue uses a fully allocated overhead method that includes an allocation of salaries and allocable expenses resulting from the delivery of our hosted web conferencing services  together with all expenses associated with the delivery of our audio conferencing services 
expenses related to our audio conferencing services that are accrued as cost of revenues include salaries and allocable expenses of our telephone operators  allocated facilities costs  allocated technical support costs for support services  together with all direct telecommunication expenses for long distance and local dial tone connectivity  and finally allocable depreciation and amortization expense related to our audio conferencing assets 
cost of subscription and audio services for fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively  a decrease of  or 
the decrease was primarily a result of the complete depreciation in may of certain audio conferencing and computer equipment  which resulted in a decrease in depreciation expense of  in fiscal the decrease was partially offset by increases in telecommunications costs of  related to the increase in audio customer per minute usage  salaries expense of  related to an increase in operators to accommodate the increased usage  as well as  was the first fiscal year we were required to record stock compensation expense  and office expenses of  the increase in office expense is primarily due to a one time elimination of liabilities associated with the glyphics acquisition in fiscal primarily related to maintenance expense for audio bridges that was determined not to be due by the vendor 
overall  we expect the cost of audio conferencing services to rise with increases in audio conferencing revenue and the percentage to remain relatively consistent for the next three years 
cost of subscription and audio conferencing revenue was approximately of total revenues in fiscal and approximately of total revenues in fiscal cost of subscription and audio services revenues for fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively  an increase of  or 
the overall increase in costs was due to the inclusion of revenues resulting from the glyphics audio conferencing acquisition for a full year in fiscal compared to ten months in fiscal the increase was partially offset by a reduction of estimates of liabilities assumed with that acquisition of  primarily in the second and third quarters of fiscal during fiscal  we determined through review of the liabilities and confirmation with glyphics vendors that these liabilities were not owed and could be eliminated as a one time reduction to expenses 
cost of subscription and audio conferencing revenues was approximately of total revenues in fiscal and approximately of total revenues in fiscal cost of maintenance and professional services revenue include an allocation of technical support personnel and facilities costs allocable to those services revenues consisting primarily of a portion of our facilities costs  communications and depreciation expenses 
however  by far the largest and most variable component of the cost of maintenance and professional services arises from the amount due to our third party subcontractor  which is a fixed proportion of the custom content revenue earned 
the cost of maintenance and professional services for fiscal and fiscal was  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
revenues from our custom content subcontractor were down  therefore  the decrease in cost of maintenance and professional services directly correlates to the decreased revenues 
cost of maintenance and professional services revenue was approximately of total revenues in each of fiscal and fiscal we expect that the increase in cost of maintenance and professional services revenue will vary proportionately and directly with the amount of professional services revenue earned in a quarter 
cost of maintenance and professional services revenue for fiscal and fiscal was  and  respectively  an increase of  resulting from an increase in custom content revenues 
cost of maintenance and professional services revenue was approximately of total revenues in fiscal and approximately of total revenue in fiscal amortization of acquired developed technology consists of amortization of acquired software technology and other assets acquired in the mentergy  glyphics and quisic acquisitions 
amortization of acquired technology for fiscal and fiscal was  and  respectively  a decrease of  which is related to the full amortization in fiscal of the software technology from the mentergy acquisition 
amortization of acquired developed technology for fiscal and fiscal was  and  respectively  a decrease of  which is related to the full amortization of the software technology from the quisic acquisition 
gross profit as the result of the foregoing  the company s gross profit total revenues less total cost of revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal we expect to see gross profit increase as revenues increase in dollar amount and as a percentage as revenues rise since most of the cost of sales are either fixed amortization or are associated only with audio conferencing and custom content service revenue 
operating expenses from continuing operations total operating expenses consist of research and development expenses  sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses 
we incurred operating expenses of million in fiscal  an increase of  or from million in fiscal this increase is due to increases in sales and marketing expenses of  and in general and administrative expenses of  which was partially offset by a decrease in research and development expense of  fiscal operating expenses were million  a decrease of million or from fiscal operating expenses of million 
this decrease was due to a decrease in research and development costs of  a decrease in sales and marketing costs of million and a decrease in general and administrative costs of  total operating expenses were  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  our management established a program to reduce operating expenses  the results of which are reflected in our levels of operating expenses for fiscal and fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development expenses represent expenses incurred in connection with the continued development and enhancement of our software products and new versions of our software 
those costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits  telecommunication allocations  rent allocations  computer equipment allocations and allocated depreciation and amortization expense 
research and development expenses for fiscal and fiscal were million and million respectively  a decrease of  or 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we began capitalizing identified direct expenses associated with a specific software development upon achieving technological feasibility for version of our web collaboration software in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
we will continue to capitalize those direct costs until the new software product is ready for distribution and sale to our customers 
once the product is released  we will amortize these software development costs over a three year period 
most of the decrease in research and development expenses for fiscal is attributable to the capitalization of those software development costs that would otherwise have been expensed 
for example  salary and benefit expense and professional services expenses attributable to research and development expense in fiscal decreased by  and  respectively  but a substantial portion of this reduction represents expense that was incurred  but capitalized 
office expense allocated to research and development increased by  in fiscal because an annual quality assurance service contract accounted for as a prepaid asset began to be amortized as well as other new annual subscription software contracts during the period 
taking into account the decrease in current expense in fiscal resulting from the capitalization of version software development costs and the increase in expense anticipated from amortization of those costs in fiscal  accompanied by an increase in salary and benefit expense since a portion of that expense had been capitalized in fiscal and  we expect research and development costs to increase in fiscal research and development expense was approximately of total revenues in fiscal and approximately of total revenues in fiscal fiscal research and development expenses were million  a decrease of  or from fiscal research and development expenses of million 
the decrease is primarily the result of decreased salaries and benefits of  related to an overall decrease in the number of employees dedicated to research and development in fiscal research and development expense was approximately of total revenues in fiscal and approximately of total revenues in fiscal sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing salaries and benefits  and also include allocated travel and entertainment costs  allocated advertising and other marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  an increase of  or 
the increase was a result of increased expenses in advertising and marketing of  and in professional services of  sales and marketing expenses were of total revenue in fiscal and of total revenue in fiscal we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in amount as revenues increase  but expect that the percentage of sales and marketing expenses incurred in relation to total revenue to remain consistent 
sales and marketing expenses were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  a decrease of million or 
the decrease primarily resulted from decreased salaries and related benefits of  due to a decrease in the average number of sales and marketing employees  decreases in marketing expenses  trade show attendance and advertising costs resulting from a cost reduction program we implemented in august overall  overhead was reduced primarily in the second and third quarter of fiscal in fiscal as compared to fiscal  marketing expenses decreased by  travel and entertainment expenses decreased  recruiting fees decreased by  and general office and other overhead expenses decreased by  sales and marketing expense in fiscal also included costs related to the amortization of customer lists and intangibles from the glyphics acquisition of  sales and marketing expenses were of total revenue in fiscal and of total revenue in fiscal general and administrative expenses consist of company wide expenses that are not directly related to research and development or sales and marketing activities  with the bulk of those general and administrative expenses comprised of salaries  rent and the costs directly associated with being a public company  including accounting costs  legal costs and fees 
during fiscal and  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were million and million  respectively  an increase of  or 
the increase is primarily a result of increased office expenses of  resulting from investments in annual software subscriptions for a new accounting general ledger package  an equity administration package and a human resources package  originally recorded as prepaid assets and amortized to office expense 
in addition general expenses that were previously allocated to all departments in fiscal  were being expensed directly to general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses also consisted of increased salaries and benefits of  resulting from fiscal being the first year we recognized stock option compensation expense  net of a decrease in professional services expense of  due to a change in the mix between full time employees and contractors  increased telecommunications expenses of  an increase in bad debt expense of  a decrease in gain on sale of assets of  and increased travel and entertainment of  in addition  other taxes increased  as a result of a reduction in tax liability of  for the three months ended december  related to the release of a tax liability that was recorded as an estimate as part of the glyphics acquisition 
the overall increase in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by decreases in legal fees of  and board and investor relations expenses of  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal during fiscal and  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were million and million  respectively  a decrease of  or 
general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to an expense management initiative led by management  which took effect primarily in the second and third quarters of fiscal the overall decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily comprised of decreases in bad debt expense of  salaries and related benefits of  contract labor of  accounting fees of  consulting fees of  recruiting fees of  legal fees of  and investor relations expense of  tax liabilities also decreased by  of which  related to the release of a tax liability that was recorded as an estimate as part of the glyphics acquisition 
after further review and confirmation from the tax authority  the company determined that the tax liability would not be realized  and therefore the liability was eliminated and a corresponding reduction of the expense was recorded as a one time reduction 
in addition  in fiscal  we recognized a gain on the sale of fixed assets of  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were of total revenue in fiscal and of total revenue in fiscal earnings from operations for fiscal  we reported earnings from operations of million as compared to earnings from operations of  for fiscal  an increase of million or 
we posted income from operations of  for fiscal and a loss from operations of million for fiscal  a positive change of million 
we expect to continue to increase earnings from operations by increasing revenues at a faster rate than our increases in expenses 
interest expense from continuing operations interest expense from continuing operations on outstanding debt instruments for fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was the result of paying off shareholders notes and debt 
non cash interest expense  arising from the beneficial conversion feature of our debt  for fiscal and fiscal was  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
this decrease resulted from conversions in fiscal  which accelerated the amortization of the beneficial conversion feature related to the debt converted 
interest expense from continuing operations paid on outstanding debt instruments for fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively  a decrease of  or primarily due to the reduction in outstanding debt 
non cash interest expense  arising from the beneficial conversion feature of our debt  for fiscal and fiscal was  and  respectively  an increase of  or less than 
we expect interest expense from continuing operations to increase slightly in fiscal as the result of i the increased interest rate accruing on our senior notes due from to per annum which began in january in connection with the agreement of the holders of those senior notes to extend the senior notes maturity from july  to july  and ii the amortization discussed below under the caption loss on extinguishment of debt 
we expect non cash interest expense resulting from the beneficial conversion feature of our debt to remain consistent in fiscal  because the amortization is straight line 
should there be any debt conversions in fiscal  the interest will increase in order to accelerate the beneficial conversion feature related to the proportion of debt converted 
income tax expense from continuing operations the company recorded income tax expense of  this expense resulted from the recognition of the deferred income tax liability related to the tax deductible goodwill recognized on the company s purchase of quisic and learnlinc 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets due to the lack of profitable operating history 
the company recorded a valuation allowance for its deferred tax asset because it concluded it is not likely it would be able to realize the tax assets due to the lack of profitable operating history of its implementation of the web conferencing and audio conferencing business plan 
based on the financial results for the year ending march   the company has begun to exhibit the ability to generate taxable income 
in the event the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income through a tax benefit in the period such a determination was made the company has met the more likely than not threshold for such recognition 
the company recorded no tax expense during fiscal and as a result of the losses it incurred in those years 
loss on extinguishment of debt in december   we negotiated a modification of the terms our senior notes  to extend the maturity date from july  to july  in exchange for the extension  the interest rate increased from per annum to per annum  with the new  increased interest rate beginning to accrue on january   and continuing thereafter at that rate until maturity or the senior note is fully paid 
all other terms and provisions of the senior notes remained unchanged 
in connection with this matter  the placement agent received a commission of  together with a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant has a three year term which expires in december also  in connection with this matter  the note agent received an expense reimbursement of  in accordance with eift  debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments  the debt extension was accounted for as an extinguishment of the existing debt and the creation of the new debt 
as a result  we recorded a one time loss on extinguishment of debt of  resulting from the acceleration of interest expense accounted for as debt discount and deferred offering costs under the original terms of the senior debt 
the direct expenses of  and the estimated fair value of the warrant of  were recorded as a deferred offering cost and both are being amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the senior notes 
results of discontinued operations effective january   we discontinued our dental practice management services 
results of operations from this segment are presented as discontinued operations for fiscal years  and in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we do not expect to recognize further income or incur further expenses related to our discontinued legacy practice management business 
liquidity and capital resources general historically  we have generated cash from capital raising activities and from cash flow from operations 
we have used cash to fund our operations and for research and development activities 
in june  we raised million of gross proceeds in a private placement of million shares of common stock 
notes and to our audited financial statements at and for fiscal years  and contain detailed information regarding our capital raising activities prior to the june private placement 
also  the discussion below under the caption outstanding preferred stock and indebtedness explains some of the impact events surrounding our capital raising activities have had on our financial statements 
at march   we had a working capital surplus of  compared to a working capital deficit of million at march  total current assets were million at march  compared to million at march  the increase in total current assets results principally from generation of cash from proceeds of a private placement in june of million and increased cash flow from operations as well as an increase of approximately  in net accounts receivable resulting from increased levels of sales 
our accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts were million and million at march  and march   respectively 
the increase in receivables is consistent with an increase in revenues year on year 
the aging of receivables has remained consistent at march  when compared to march   with accounts under days comprising and of the total receivable balance  respectively 
also contributing to the increase in total current assets were an increase of approximately  in prepaid expenses and other current assets as the result of the issuance of a warrant on july  for up to  shares of the company s common stock to an agent 
the warrant is subject to vesting provisions based on net collected revenue targets achieved through the agent and certain value added resellers over a five year period  effective june  as of march   none of the revenue targets had been achieved 
as a result  we recorded a prepaid asset and corresponding additional paid in capital of  as the fair value 
we also had an increase in contracts related to annual subscription software agreements related to research and development and accounting activities that we prepaid in addition to an increase in annual sales and marketing agreements we initiated during fiscal total current liabilities were million at march  compared to million at march  contributing to the decrease in current liabilities were a million decrease in accrued liabilities resulting from payments of a royalty earn out of million related to our purchase of certain assets from mentergy  inc  as well as  reductions of  in the current portion of long term debt   in trade accounts payable and  in current portion of capital lease liabilities 
deferred revenue increased from  to million at march  compared to  at march   as the result of increased license sales and renewals based on sustaining our customer base 
contractual obligations the following schedule details all of the company s indebtedness and the required payments related to such obligations at march  in thousands

the lease obligations above include commitments in accordance with amendments to the lease for the phoenix location that was renegotiated and extended subsequent to march  see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
we plan to continue to focus on managing overhead while increasing revenue in an effort to solidify our working capital position 
we believe that we will have sufficient working capital and liquidity to meet our operating needs  fund our planned research and development activities and to satisfy our contractual obligations in fiscal without the need to raise additional capital 
cash flows from continuing operations cash provided by operating activities was  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
cash used by operating activities was million during fiscal in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization of  non cash accretion of debt discount to interest expense of  income from continuing operations of  loss on debt extinguishment of  due to the extension of our senior notes  non cash stock option expense of  an increase in the provision for bad debts of  and an increase of  in deferred revenue 
these items were offset by increases in accounts receivable of  prepaid expenses and other current assets of  and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
depreciation and amortization expense was significantly less in fiscal than fiscal because a portion our assets were fully depreciated in may fiscal was the first year in which we were required to recognize non cash stock option expense 
cash provided by operating activities was  during fiscal cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was primarily attributable to non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization of million  accretion of debt discount to interest expense of  and net debt conversion expense of  these items were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of  decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  and a net loss of million

outstanding indebtedness and preferred stock the company currently has outstanding unsecured subordinated convertible notes due march    issued and outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock and  issued and outstanding shares of series b convertible preferred stock  together with  in principal amount of senior notes 
all of the foregoing securities were issued in connection with the company s capital raising activities 
a detailed discussion of the terms of these securities and the impact of issuance of and certain events surrounding these securities on our financial statements follows 
in march  the company issued  in principal amount of the convertible notes  the proceeds of which were used to extinguish an existing line of credit 
the convertible notes bear interest at the rate of per annum and require quarterly interest payments  with the principal due at maturity on march  the holders of the convertible notes may convert the principal into shares of the company s common stock at the fixed price of per share 
the company may force redemption by conversion of the principal into common stock at the fixed conversion price  if at any time the trading day average closing price of the company s common stock exceeds per share 
the convertible notes are subordinated to any present or future senior indebtedness 
in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes  the company also issued warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock for an exercise price of per share 
those warrants expired on march  without exercise 
there was no financial impact on the company s income statement as a result of the expiration of these warrants 
the fair value of the warrants was estimated using a black scholes pricing model with the following assumptions contractual and expected life of three years  volatility of  dividend yield of  and a risk free rate of 
a discount to the convertible notes of  was recorded using this value  which is being amortized to interest expense over the year term of the convertible notes 
as the carrying value of the convertible notes is less than the conversion value  a beneficial conversion feature of  was calculated and recorded as an additional discount to the convertible notes and is being amortized to interest expense over the ten year term of the convertible notes 
upon conversion  any remaining discount and beneficial conversion feature will be expensed in full at the time of conversion 
during fiscal  holders with a principal balance of  agreed to convert their convertible notes and  of accrued interest into  shares of the company s common stock  the resale of which was registered under the securities act of at a price of  and per share 
since the actual conversion price for the convertible debt was less than the fixed conversion price of  the company recorded conversion expense of  for fiscal during fiscal  the company accelerated the amortization of the deferred offering costs and the discount and beneficial conversion feature associated with the  in convertible notes that were converted in by expensing  and  respectively at the time of conversion 
no conversion of convertible notes or related acceleration of amortization of costs occurred during fiscal on september   the company completed its private placement of series a preferred stock with detachable warrants 
the company sold units at  each and raised a total of  each unit consisted of  shares of series a preferred stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock 
the series a preferred stock has a liquidation preference of per share and is convertible into the company s common stock at a price of per share or shares of common stock for each share of series a preferred stock  subject to adjustment  and the warrants were immediately exercisable at a price of per share with a three year term 
these warrants expired in without financial impact on the company s income statement

since the actual conversion price for the debt was greater than the market value of the common stock at the date of conversion  the company recorded a gain on conversion of  for the period ended december  in connection with this conversion  during fiscal  the company accelerated the amortization of the deferred offering costs and the discount associated with the debt converted by expensing  and  respectively at the time of conversion 
on november   the placement agent warrants originally issued with an exercise price of per common share were exchanged for  common shares at an exercise price of per share  in which the company received  in cash

during fiscal  holders of  shares of series b preferred stock converted those shares into  shares of the company s common stock

off balance sheet transactions there are no off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations or other relationships of the company with unsolicited entities or other persons that have or may have a material effect on financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources of the company 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the more significant areas requiring use of estimates relate to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and notes receivable valuation reserves  realizability of intangible assets  realizability of deferred income tax assets and the evaluation of contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of such estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company considers an accounting policy to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate that requires the company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made 
in addition  different estimates that the company reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period would have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the company believes there are a number of accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance 
the critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  sales reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts  software development costs  intangible assets  income taxes and stock based compensation 
these critical accounting policies that affect the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition our revenues are generally classified into three main categories software license revenues  subscription and audio services revenues and maintenance and professional services revenues 
software license revenues are generated from the sale of our ilinc suite of web conferencing software on a software purchase model basis and from the sale of our off the shelf courseware 
subscription and audio services revenues are generated from the sale of our ilinc suite of web conferencing software on an application service provider asp model basis  the sale of our ilinc suite software on a per minute basis  and includes all revenues from the provision of audio conferencing services  as well as  all service contracts that might include hosting and training services 
maintenance and professional service revenues are generated from the sale of maintenance contracts related to our ilinc suite of web conferencing software on a purchase model basis and from the sale of professional services that are associated with our custom content development services 
sales of software licenses because we offer the ilinc suite software in one of two forms  the first being a purchase model and the second being an asp or per minute model  we have separate revenue recognition policies applicable to each licensing model 
with each sale of our web conferencing products and services  we execute written contracts with our customers that govern the terms and conditions of each software license sale  hosting agreement  maintenance and support agreement  and other services arrangements 
we do not typically execute written agreements for the sale of audio conferencing services 
in connection with the company s sales of software licenses  whether on a purchase model basis or periodic license basis  the company adopted statement of position sop  software revenue recognition as issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
in accordance with sop  the company recognizes revenue from the sale of software licenses if all of the following conditions are met first  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer  second  the product has been delivered to the customer  third  the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable  and  fourth  collection of the fee is probable 
each of these factors  particularly the determination of whether a fee is fixed and determinable and the collectability of the resulting receivable  requires the application of the judgment and the estimates of management 
therefore  significant management judgment is utilized and estimates must be made in connection with the revenue we recognize in any accounting period 
we analyze various factors  including a review of the nature of the license or product sold  the terms of each specific transaction  the vendor specific objective evidence of the elements required by sop  any contingencies that may be present  our historical experience with like transactions or with like products  the creditworthiness of the customer and other current market and economic conditions 
changes in our judgment based upon these factors and others could impact the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize  and ultimately the results of operations and our financial condition 
therefore  the recognition of revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
at the time of the sale of our software licenses on a purchase license basis  we assess whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction before recording immediate revenue recognition  assuming all other elements of revenue recognition are present 
billings to our customers are generally due within to days  with payment terms up to days available to certain credit worthy customers 
we believe that we have sufficient history of collecting all amounts within these normal payment terms and to conclude that the fee is fixed or determinable at the time of the perpetual license sale 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms longer than days not to be fixed or determinable and for arrangements involving the extended payment terms exceeding days  revenue recognition occurs when payments are collected  assuming all other elements of revenue recognition are present 
in addition  in assessing whether collection is probable or not for a given transaction  and therefore whether we should recognize the revenue  we make estimates regarding the creditworthiness of the customer 
initial creditworthiness is assessed through internal credit check processes  such as credit applications or third party reporting agencies 
creditworthiness for transactions to existing customers primarily relies upon a review of their prior payment history 
we do not request collateral or other security from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of payment or other change in circumstance 
during fiscal  ilinc launched its enterprise unlimited perpetual licensing model that enables customers to pay a one time up front fee for unlimited  organization wide web conferencing  with revenue recognized at the time of the sale of the enterprise unlimited perpetual license 
the annual maintenance and support fees and hosting fees associated with an ilinc enterprise unlimited license are based upon a fixed rate per seat license that is active on each annual anniversary of the ilinc enterprise unlimited license agreement and that is approximately equivalent to the to charged for concurrent seat perpetual license contracts 
customers may expand the number of active seats available to them at any time with a corresponding increase in annual maintenance and hosting fees being charged with the additional revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the contract 
sales of concurrent licenses on an asp and per minute basis historically and on a continuing basis  a majority of our license revenue has been generated under the software purchase model basis  with revenue recognized based on a one time sale of a perpetual license 
in addition to that purchase model software sale  we also offer a more flexible concurrent connection seat license and a pay per minute usage based model 
under our asp model  a customer may subscribe to a certain number of concurrent connections or seats for a fixed period  often a year 
under this asp method  we recognize the revenue associated with these monthly  fixed fee subscription arrangements each month on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
other customers choose to avoid annual commitments and instead use our web conferencing and audio conferencing products and services based upon a per minute or usage based pricing model 
per minute customers may also include those customers on an asp model that incur overage fees for usage in excess of the permitted number of seats or minutes in excess of the minimum commitment 
the per minute fees that include overage fees are charged at the end of each month and recorded as revenue at the end of each month as the services are provided 
customers with contractually established minimum per minute fees are assessed the greater of the established minimum or the actual usage at the end of each month 
customers wishing to avoid monthly commitments may use the e commerce portion of our web site that permits the use of our web conferencing services on a pay per use basis  with no monthly minimum  purchasing the services and paying for those services online by credit card 
sales of maintenance  hosting  and other related services the company offers with each sale of its software products a software maintenance  upgrade  and support arrangement 
these contracts may be elements in a multiple element arrangement or may be sold in a stand alone basis 
revenues from maintenance and support services are recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the term that the maintenance service is provided 
maintenance contracts typically provide for month terms with maintenance contracts available up to months 
the company typically charges to of the software purchase price for a month contract with discounts available for longer term agreements 
the annual maintenance and support fees and hosting fees associated with an ilinc enterprise unlimited license are based upon a fixed rate per seat license that is active on each annual anniversary of the ilinc enterprise unlimited license agreement and that is approximately equivalent to the to charged for concurrent seat perpetual license contracts 
the company also typically charges for hosting of purchase model software sales for customers who do not wish to install and host the ilinc suite on their own premises or that of a co location facility 
charges for hosting are likewise spread ratably over the term of the hosting agreement  with the typical hosting agreement having a term of months  with renewal on an annual basis 
revenues from consulting  training  and education services are recognized either as the services are performed  ratably over a subscription period  or upon completing a project milestone if defined in the agreement 
these consulting  training  and education services  are not considered essential to the functionality of our products as these services do not alter the product capabilities  do not require specialized skills  and are often performed by the customer or our var s customers without access to those services 
implementation  consulting  training  translation and other event type services may also be sold in conjunction with the sale of our software products 
those services are generally recognized as the services are performed or earlier when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
although the company may provide implementation  training and consulting services on a time and materials basis  a significant portion of these services have been provided on a fixed fee basis 
should the sale of our software involve an arrangement with multiple elements for example  the sale of a software license along with the sale of maintenance and support to be delivered over the contract period  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
we defer revenue from the arrangement equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the remaining amount at the time of the delivery of the product or when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations are based upon separate sales of renewals of maintenance contracts 
fair value of services  such as training or consulting  is based upon separate sales of these services to other customers 
thus  these types of arrangements require us to make judgments about the fair value of undelivered arrangements 
sales of custom content development services a component of our maintenance and professional services revenue is derived from custom content development services 
the sale of custom content development services often involves the execution of a master service agreement and corresponding work orders describing the deliverable due  the costs involved  the project milestones  and the payments required 
these custom content development services are primarily outsourced to a subcontractor  interactive alchemy 
for contracts and revenues related exclusively to custom content development services  the company recognizes revenue and profit as work progresses on custom content service contracts using the percentage of completion method 
this method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs as each job progresses throughout the relevant contract period 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of a custom content service contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the custom content service contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
customers sometimes request modifications to projects in progress which may result in significant revisions to cost estimates and profit recognition  and the company may not be successful in negotiating additional payments related to the changes in scope of requested services 
should this arise  the provision for any estimated losses on uncompleted custom content service contracts are made in the period in which such losses become evident 
there were no such losses at march  for any custom content development services 
for arrangements requiring customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until the earlier of the end of the acceptance period or until written notice of acceptance is received from the customer 
sales by distributors the company has engaged organizations within the united states of america and in other countries that market and sell its products and services through their sales distribution channels that are value added resellers vars 
the vars primarily sell  on a non exclusive basis  our ilinc suite of web conferencing products and predominately sell purchase model perpetual licenses for installation and hosting by the var s customer 
the company s var contracts have terms of one to two years and are automatically renewed for an additional like term unless either party terminates the agreement for breach or other financial reasons 
each var purchases the product from the company and resells the product to its customers 
under those var agreements  the company records only the amount paid by the var as revenue and recognizes revenue when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the company also engages organizations that act as mere agents or distributors of its products agents  without title passing to the agent and with the agent only receiving a commission on the consummation of the sale to our customer 
the company records revenue on sales by agents on a gross basis before commissions due to the agent and only when all revenue recognition criteria are met as would be with a sale by the company directly to a customer not involving an agent 
sales reserves the sales reserve is an estimate for losses on receivables resulting from customer credits  cancellations and terminations and is recorded  if at all  as a reduction in revenue at the time of the sale 
increases to sales reserve are charged to revenue  reducing the revenue otherwise reportable 
the sales reserve estimate is based on an analysis of the historical rate of credits  cancellations and terminations 
the accuracy of the estimate is dependent on the rate of future credits  cancellations and terminations being consistent with the historical rate 
if the rate of actual credits  cancellations and terminations is different than the historical rate  revenue would be different from what was reported 
as of march   we did not believe that an accrual for sales reserves was necessary  and we will continue to assess the adequacy of the sales reserve account balance on a quarterly basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for losses on accounts receivable due to customer credit risk 
increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to general and administrative expense as bad debt expense 
losses on accounts receivable due to financial distress or failure of the customer are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance estimate is based on an analysis of the historical rate of credit losses 
the accuracy of the estimate is dependent on the future rate of credit losses being consistent with the historical rate 
if the rate of future credit losses is greater than the historical rate  then the allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient to provide for actual credit losses 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is  and  respectively  as of march  and and is based on our historical collection experience 
any adjustments to these accounts are reflected in the income statement for the current period  as an adjustment to revenue in the case of the sales reserve and as a general and administrative expense in the case of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
software development costs the company accounts for software development costs in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  whereby costs for the development of new software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time any additional costs are capitalized 
technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model 
costs of maintenance and customer support are charged to expense when related revenue is recognized or when those costs are incurred  whichever occurs first 
in may of  the company began production of version of its web collaboration software 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company began capitalizing certain direct and indirect software development costs that included expenses related to employee payroll costs  consultant fees  dedicated computer hardware costs and specialized software license costs associated with this project 
as of march   the company capitalized costs totaling  version was completed and released to customers in june the company will begin amortization of these capitalized costs  using straight line amortization over a three year period beginning july intangible assets on april   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and as a result  the company s goodwill is no longer amortized 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
upon initial and subsequent application of sfas no 
 the company determined there was no impairment of goodwill 
the company has established the date of march on which to value its goodwill 
the company has made acquisitions of companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus and has recorded goodwill and other intangible assets associated with its acquisitions 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying acquired operations could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company has determined that impairment of that goodwill and intangible assets was not required 
the company s management believes no such impairment exists at march  debt issuance costs are amortized using the straight line method over the term of the related debt obligations 
other intangibles primarily consist of the learnlinc and glyphics purchase consideration that was allocated to purchased software and customer relationship intangibles 
such other intangibles are amortized over their expected benefit period of to months 
income taxes the company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred taxes are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted marginal tax rates currently in effect when the differences reverse 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets due to the lack of profitable operating history 
the company recorded a valuation allowance for its deferred tax asset because it concluded it is not likely it would be able to realize the tax assets due to the lack of profitable operating history of its implementation of the web conferencing and audio conferencing business plan 
based on the financial results for the year ending march   the company has begun to exhibit the ability to generate taxable income 
in the event the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income through a tax benefit in the period such a determination was made the company has met the more likely than not threshold for such recognition 
stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under this new standard  companies will no longer be able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance with apb instead  companies are required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and to recognize the expense over the service period 
sfas r became effective for the company for periods beginning after march  and allows for several alternative transition methods 
the company adopted sfas r effective april   which requires recognition of compensation expense for all stock option or other equity based awards that vest or become exercisable after the option s effective date 
the company elected the modified prospective application transition method of adoption and  as such  prior period financial statements have not been restated 
under this method  the fair value of all stock options granted or modified after adoption must be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and total compensation cost related to non vested awards not yet recognized  as determined under the original provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  must also be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as vesting occurs 
guarantees and indemnifications the company provides a limited day warranty for certain of its software products 
historically  claims by customers under this limited warranty have been minimal  and as such  no warranty accrual has been provided for in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and rescission of fin the following is a summary of the company s agreements that the company has determined are within the scope of fin no 
under its bylaws  the company has agreed to indemnify its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences arising as a result of the officers or directors serving in such capacity 
the term of the indemnification period is for the officer or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
however  the company has a director and officer liability insurance policy that limits its exposure and enables it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as a result of its insurance policy coverage  the company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal and has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of march  the company enters into indemnification provisions under i its agreements with other companies in its ordinary course of business  typically with business partners  contractors  and customers  landlords and ii its agreements with investors 
under these provisions the company generally indemnifies and holds harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the company s activities or  in some cases  as a result of the indemnified party s activities under the agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
the company has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  the company believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  the company has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of march  recent accounting pronouncements in june  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
eitf provides that the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer on either a gross basis included in revenues and costs or on a net basis excluded from revenues is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
the provisions of eitf became effective as of december  our adoption of etif has not and is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in july   the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we are in the process of determining the effect  but believe the impact of the adoption of fin will not be significant to our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which provides guidance on how to measure assets and liabilities that use fair value 
sfas will apply whenever another us gaap standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances 
this standard also will require additional disclosures in both annual and quarterly reports 
sfas will be effective for fiscal we are currently evaluating the potential impact this standard may have on its financial position and results of operations 
on february   the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

under this standard  we may elect to report financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a contract by contract basis with changes in value reported in earnings 
this election is irrevocable 
sfas no 
provides an opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings that is caused by measuring hedged assets and liabilities that were previously required to use a different accounting method than the related hedging contracts when the complex provisions of sfas no 
hedge accounting are not met 
sfas no 
is effective for years beginning after november  early adoption within days of the beginning of our fiscal year is permissible  provided we have not yet issued interim financial statement for and have adopted sfas no 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this standard 
in september  sec issued sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying current year misstatements 
sab no 
requires analysis of misstatements using both an income statement rollover approach and a balance sheet iron curtain approach in assessing materiality and provides for a one time cumulative effect transition adjustment 
sab no 
is effective for our fiscal year annual financial statements 
we adopted sab effective april  we noted an accumulation of prior period errors related to the accounting for tax deductible goodwill 
we have analyzed these amounts both quantitatively and qualitatively and have concluded that they are not material to the periods affected 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we increased beginning accumulated deficit and net deferred income tax liability by  note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we have not traded or otherwise bought and sold derivatives nor do we expect to in the future 
we also do not invest in market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we provide our products and services to customers in the united states  europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
sales are predominately made in us dollars  however  we have sold products that were payable in euros and canadian dollars 
a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products and services less competitive in foreign markets 
the primary objective of the company s investment activity is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  the company maintains its portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of money market funds 
as of march   the carrying value of our outstanding convertible redeemable subordinated notes and unsecured senior notes was approximately million at fixed interest rates of to 
in certain circumstances  we may redeem this long term debt 
our other components of indebtedness of  bear interest rates of to 
increases in interest rates could increase the interest expense associated with future borrowings  if any 
we do not hedge against interest rate increases
