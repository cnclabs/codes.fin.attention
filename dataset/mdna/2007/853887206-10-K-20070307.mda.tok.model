item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share amounts this management s discussion and analysis provides material historical and prospective disclosures intended to enable investors and other users to assess our financial condition and results of operations 
statements that are not historical are forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under the caption risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k and elsewhere in this report 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview the company we are a leading document services provider that helps our customers manage  control and source their document and print related spending 
we primarily serve the healthcare  financial services  and manufacturing industries 
we are a document services company entrusted by our customers to manage business critical documents with a variety of products and professional services 
as a strategic partner in migrating companies from paper based to digital processes  our strategy is to provide a full spectrum of solutions including printing solutions  label solutions  print on demand services  document and marketing automation  outsourcing and managed services  and professional services 
our enterprise document management approach includes analysis of where  how and even if documents should be printed 
this document study includes everything from forms  stationery and reports to four color marketing collateral and also addresses what is printed internally as well as externally 
by improving the efficiency of these processes and applying appropriate sourcing strategies  customers are able to save on their entire document related supply chain costs 
our solutions give customers the tools to manage the entire lifecycle of their documents from concept to delivery 
we make a measurable difference for our customers by helping them achieve their desired business outcomes by assisting them with reducing costs  transitioning to more efficient processes  effectively managing their risks and meeting their regulatory and industry requirements  and driving their business growth 
our operations include three reportable segments document and label solutions  pod services  and digital solutions 
our business challenges the market for many of our traditional printed products is very price competitive 
in order to maintain or improve our margins in these segments  we must execute our plans to gain market share  improve productivity  and increase the sale of related value added software and services 
paper mill operating rates were reported in the range during  which were above rates and served to support increases in paper prices 
the expectation is that mills will continue to reduce capacity during in an attempt to offset expected weakness in overall paper demand and pricing 
there are currently no price announcements in the market  however  pulp and energy costs  coupled with less supply  may push prices modestly higher in the second half of despite a competitive marketplace  we have traditionally been successful in recovering all or most of the increases in paper costs 
recovery ordinarily occurs over a period of several quarters 
we would expect to increase our selling prices to our customers to recover any paper cost increases that might take place in we fully expect the increasing use of reverse auctions and other bidding tools will gain in popularity and will most likely lower our prices for our printed products 
our pension plan became underfunded in late  primarily as a result of weak stock market returns in and the amortization of these and other actuarial losses has resulted in significant expense in subsequent years equivalent to per share in and per share in we have continued to make voluntary cash contributions to our qualified pension plan  averaging approximately million annually over the last five years  we plan to make voluntary contributions in of approximately million 
our digital solutions segment has produced operating losses in recent periods  reflecting software development and other investments made to bring our digital pen and paper technology and services solution to market 
we have made significant investments in this venture over the last three years and believe there is a very good likelihood that a viable market will emerge for this technology 
we have elected to seek venture capital investment in order to continue the business plan and will likely spin this venture out and become a minority partner 
our focus our objective is to continue to improve the sales trend in our core document business by taking market share in targeted accounts and vertical markets where we have a strong reputation and value proposition 
we will continue to reduce costs and improve productivity in order to stay cost competitive 
we plan to address the large and growing market to provide for digital print on demand output  including color and variable print 
services that provide the customer with added convenience  design capability and control over the process are expected to be a strong differentiator 
we plan to step up the level of investment in our pod services business in order to ensure that we catch the building market momentum in this important growth segment 
this will translate into higher capital expenditures and selling  general and administrative expenses in the coming quarters 
we intend to continue to bring our customers products and services that improve their ability to capture  manage and move information in their business processes 
we also offer a portfolio of standard register managed services that help our customers reduce costs and improve their business processes allowing them to concentrate on their core competencies 
over time  services will become an increasing source of our revenue stream 
our strategy is beginning to resonate with customers and we have successfully completed implementation of these offerings 
we expect to continue to focus on generating positive cash flow and maintaining our current strong financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we applied the accounting policies disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based on information presently available and actual results may differ significantly from those estimates 
we consider the estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they place the most significant demands on management s judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and the impact of different estimates or assumptions is material to our financial condition or results of operations 
specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs 
the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates are discussed throughout this discussion and analysis where such estimates affect reported and expected financial results 
with the exception of contingent liabilities  the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions pertaining to pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans  asset impairments  deferred taxes  and lifo reserves generally do not affect segment results 
share based compensation expense is reflected in se gment results through an allocation of corporate expenses 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plan assumptions we have defined benefit pension plans covering eligible us employees 
we also have a postretirement benefit plan that provides certain healthcare benefits for eligible retired employees 
included in our financial results are significant pension and postretirement obligations and benefit costs and credits which are measured using actuarial valuations 
the use of actuarial models requires us to make certain assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments 
such assumptions include the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the rate of future compensation increases and the healthcare cost trend rate 
in addition  the actuarial calculation includes subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to estimate the projected benefit obligation 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension or postret irement obligations and benefit expense recorded in future periods 
discount rate one of the principal components of calculating the projected benefit obligation  the accumulated benefit obligation and certain components of pension and postretirement healthcare benefit expense is the assumed discount rate 
the discount rate is the assumed rate at which future pension and postretirement healthcare benefits could be effectively settled 
the discount rate established at fiscal year end for the benefit obligations is also used in the calculation of the interest component of benefit expense for the following year 
discount rates are established based on prevailing market rates for high quality  fixed income instruments with maturities equal to the future cash flows to pay the benefit obligations when due 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets one of the principal components of the net periodic pension cost calculation is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the required use of an expected long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns and therefore result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by our employees 
our qualified defined benefit pension plan s assets are invested in a broadly diversified portfolio consisting primarily of publicly traded common stocks and fixed income securities 
we use long term historical actual return experience and estimates of future long ter m investment return with consideration to the expected investment mix of the plan s assets to develop our expected rate of return assumption used in the net periodic pension cost calculation 
differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the pension cost calculation over five years using a five year  market related asset value method of amortization 
the amortization of these differences has  and could continue to have  a significant effect on net periodic pension cost 
our nonqualifed pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans are unfunded plans and have no plan assets 
therefore  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is not a factor in accounting for these benefit plans 
assumptions regarding mortality one of the assumptions made in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation is an estimate of mortality rates for the population of pension participants 
our actuaries use mortality tables  which include death rates for each age  in estimating the amount of pension benefits that will become payable 
the mortality tables include the proportion of the number of deaths in a specified group to the number living at the beginning of the period in which the deaths occur 
we changed to the rp mortality table to determine benefit obligations at december  and to determine pension and postretirement benefit cost for this change increased our pension benefit obligation by approximately million and decreased our postretirement healthcare benefit obligation by approximately million 
our pension expense will increase in by approximately million and our postret irement benefit income will decrease by approximately million as a result of this change 
rate of future compensation increases the rate of anticipated future compensation increases is another significant assumption used in the actuarial model for pension accounting and is determined based upon our long term plans for such increases 
healthcare cost trend rate one of the principal components of calculating the projected benefit obligation  as well as the net periodic benefit cost for our postretirement healthcare plan  is the healthcare cost trend rate 
we review external data and our own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates used for the benefit obligation and expense 
we review the assumptions used to account for pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations and cost each fiscal year end 
weighted average assumptions projected benefit obligation discount rate future compensation increase rate current year subsequent years holding all other assumptions constant  a increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase the pension and postretirement obligation recorded by approximately million and million  respectively 
a increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would increase the postretirement healthcare benefit obligation recorded by approximately million  and a decrease would reduce the obligation by million 
net periodic benefit cost discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets healthcare cost trend rate assumed for current year rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline the ultimate trend rate year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate the change in the discount rate increased pension cost by million and had an immaterial impact on postretirement healthcare benefit cost 
holding all other assumptions constant  a increase or decrease in the discount rate would increase or decrease pension cost by approximately million and would have an immaterial impact on the postretirement benefit cost 
amortization of differences between the expected and actual returns on the plan assets  including those resulting from losses in and  will continue to impact our pension cost 
the long term rate of return on plan assets that we expect to use to determine fiscal net periodic pension cost is  the same as the amortization of past market losses and other probable changes in actuarial assumptions is expected to increase pension cost by approximately million over the amount 
total pension expense is expected to increase over the amount by approximately million  excluding any applicable pension settlement losses 
during the company determined that the prescription benefits offered under medicare part d were more favorable to its retirees than the rates offered under the company s postretirement healthcare benefit plan 
as a result  effective january   the plan was amended to discontinue prescription benefits offered under the plan 
the effect of this change reduced the benefit obligation at january  by million and reduced postretirement benefit cost in by approximately million 
impairment of long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets  which include intangible assets  goodwill  and plant and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following sustained underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results changes in the manner of use of the assets  their physical condition or the strategy for the company s overall business negative industry or economic trends declines in stock price of an investment for a sustained period the company s market capitalization relative to net book value a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit  or a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of  significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset unanticipated competition a loss of key personnel 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are required to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  using a fair value based test that compares the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
fair values are typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate 
planetprint goodwill during the second quarters of and  the company performed the annual impairment test for goodwill which did not result in any impairment 
the tests were performed at the reporting unit level using a fair value based test that compares the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
in performing the tests for impairment  we made assumptions about future sales and profitability that required significant judgment 
in estimating expected future cash flows for the test  we used internal forecasts that were based upon actual results assuming flat to slightly increasing revenue and modest cost and gross margin improvement 
at the time of the impairment test  the carrying value of net assets for planetprint was million 
the most critical estimates used in determining the expected future cash flows were the revenue and cost assumptions and the terminal value assumed 
if our estimate of expected future cash flows had been lower  or if either of these two assumptions changed by  the expected future cash flows would still have exceeded the carrying value of the assets  including goodwill 
deferred taxes we record income taxes under the asset and liability method 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
at december   we have net deferred tax assets of million attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans  tax planning strategies and other expectations about future outcomes 
since the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted  changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results  and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
our ability to realize deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on the future taxable income of the taxable entity to which the deferred tax asset relates 
we evaluate all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
valuation allowances the decision to record a valuation allowance requires varying degrees of judgment based upon the nature of the item giving rise to the deferred tax asset 
we have established valuation allowances for us and canadian capital loss carryforwards that we believe will not be utilized before the expiration period 
should future taxable income be materially different from our estimates  changes in the valuation allowance could occur that would impact our tax expense in the future 
inventories substantially all inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and are stated using the last in  first out lifo dollar value method 
we subcontract  store  and later distribute finished goods to fulfill certain customer orders 
such subcontracted finished goods inventories are recorded at cost on a first in  first out fifo basis and amounts related to such subcontracted finished goods inventories are excluded from our lifo calculation 
at december  and january   the amounts excluded for subcontracted finished goods inventories were million and million  respectively 
we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues 
under the lifo method  the cost assigned to items sold is based on the cost of the most recent items purchased 
as a result  the costs of the first items purchased remain in inventory and are used to value ending inventory 
the excess of our estimated current costs over lifo carrying value  or the lifo reserve  was approximately million and million at december  and january  under the dollar value lifo method  similar items of inventory are aggregated to form inventory pools 
increases and decreases in a pool are identified and measured in terms of the total dollar value not the quantity of physical items of inventory in the pool 
the use of indices is an integral part of the dollar value lifo method 
using the link chain technique  a cumulative index is used to convert deflate year end inventories priced at current cost to base year cost and to convert inflate an increment stated at base year cost back to lifo cost 
under both techniques  indices are developed by pricing all inventory items twice 
in other words  inventory quantities on hand at the end of the current year are priced at current year current costs and at prior year current costs 
this ratio of costs is then used to adjust the cumulative index at the end of the preceding year to a new cumulative index 
the to tal current cost of current year end inventories is next converted to total base year cost by means of the new cumulative index 
the net change in inventory is then determined by comparing the total inventory at base year cost at the beginning and the end of the current year 
lifo values are determined  by layer  by applying the applicable cumulative index to the increments stated at base year cost 
we evaluate the lifo calculation each quarter and record an adjustment each quarter  if necessary  for the expected annual effect of inflation  and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end 
we determine the lifo cost on an interim basis by estimating annual inflation trends  annual purchases and ending inventory levels for the fiscal year 
we apply internally developed indices that we believe more consistently measure inflation or deflation in the components of our inventories and product mix and our merchandise mix 
we believe the internally developed indices more accurately reflect inflation or deflation in our own prices than the us bureau of labor statistics producer price indices or other published indices 
should actual annual inflation rates and inventory balances as of the end of any fiscal year differ materially from our interim estimates  changes could occur that would materially affect our consolida ted statement of income for that year 
at december   a increase in our cumulative index would have increased our lifo expense approximately million  or approximately million after tax 
conversely  a decrease in our cumulative index would have decreased our lifo expense by approximately million  or approximately million after tax 
contingent liabilities accruals for contingent liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
at january   our total liability for unclaimed funds was million  including an estimate of the liability for the results of an ongoing audit related to numerous states for years prior to we believed this was a critical accounting estimate because of the considerable uncertainty surrounding estimation  including the outcome of the ongoing audit 
the calculation was based upon evaluation of information that was available to us at that time  prior experience in settling state audits  an estimate for any interest and penalties  as well as any liability for states not involved in the audit 
actual results could have differed from the expected results used in determining the estimate 
in the second quarter of  we reached a favorable settlement to that audit and reversed million of the reserve to income 
share based compensation expense effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment revised  which requires that compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements based on estimated fair values 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas r 
we recognized a reduction of expense  net of taxes  to record the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  incremental compensation expense recognized under sfas no 
r in is not material 
we previously accounted for share based compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no share based employee compensation cost for stock options was recognized in consolidated net income  as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
in december  the compensation committee of the company s board of directors voted to accelerate the vesting of approximately  unvested options which had option prices at least greater than the market price as of december  the accelerated vesting of these stock options provided reward  recognition and immediate motivation for the company s associates 
by accelerating the vesting on these out of the money options  we reduced the future expense to be recognized under sfas no 
r by approximately  which we believed was in the best interest of the shareholders 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be different in the future 
under the fair value recognition provisions  we recognize stock based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation expense for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
we currently have  shares of performance based restricted stock which vests upon attainment of a performance goal by the company by fiscal year end we currently expect the full amount of the outstanding performance based restricted stock awards to vest in and therefore have not reduced compensation expense for estimated forfeitures 
as of december   we have recognized million of expense and expect to recognize an additional million in if the performance goal is not attained in  these restricted stock awards will be forfeited and canceled and all expense recognized to date will be reversed 
results of operations discontinued operations in june  we sold of the outstanding capital stock of insystems corporation insystems to whitehill technologies  inc 
for million in cash  plus the return of certain cash deposits the transaction resulted in a loss of approximately million  net of taxes  which includes a charge of million for contractual obligations to whitehill technologies  inc  related to the leased facility 
in conjunction with the recording of this contractual obligation  we reversed a restructuring liability of million to discontinued operations 
in december  we sold selected assets and transferred selected liabilities of our former equipment service business to pitney bowes for approximately million in cash and retained million of equipment service business accounts receivable 
the transaction resulted in a gain of million net of taxes 
the insystems and equipment service businesses were sold because they no longer fit with the company s strategic direction 
the sale of insystems  a reportable segment since its acquisition in  and the sale of the equipment service business  a component of the document and label solutions segment  met the criteria to be accounted for as a discontinued operation under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as a result  we have segregated the assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses of these discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income 
cash flows related to discontinued operations are not separately disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
revenue  results of operations  and gain or loss on sale for these discontinued operations appear in the table below 
revenue insystems equipment service total loss gain from discontinued operations  net of tax insystems equipment service total loss gain on sales of discontinued operations  net of tax insystems equipment service total continuing operations the discussion that follows provides information which we believe is relevant to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition  supplemented by a discussion of segment results where appropriate 
the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the discussion includes non gaap financial measures that exclude asset impairments  restructuring charges  pension loss amortization  pension settlement loss  and certain tax adjustments 
we believe that the non gaap financial measures presented will enhance the understanding of our results of operations due to the non operational nature of the identified items and the significant and varying effect they have on our reported results from period to period 
this presentation is consistent with the manner in which our board of directors establishes incentives and internally evaluates performance 
this non gaap information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
references to   and refer to the week periods ended december  and january  and the week period ended january  overview consolidated revenue from continuing operations has grown modestly in each of the last two years  up and in and adjusting for the extra accounting week in  which added an estimated million to s revenue  the increase would have been 
more noteworthy perhaps is evidence of a gradual but accelerating shift in the composition of the company s revenue 
traditional  business forms are less in demand  yielding to competing technologies or shorter run digitally printed documents 
labels have continued to play a larger role and our focus on offering tailored total document solutions to our customers has added an increased focus on commercial print  application software  and services 
consolidated gross margin improved million in on an incremental revenue gain of million  rebounding from the million gross margin decline in as a percent of revenue  the overall gross margin was in  in  and in we evaluate our financial performance primarily on operating income before restructuring  impairment  pension loss amortization  and pension settlement losses 
on this basis  consolidated operating income was million in  compared to million in  and million in the following table reconciles our consolidated financial statements to these amounts 
income loss from continuing operations asset impairments restructuring charges amortization of prior period pension losses pension settlement loss total pre tax operating income  exluding the above revenue  gross margin  and operating income loss by segment we also evaluate each of our segments on the same basis  except lifo inventory adjustments are also excluded 
the actual cost of sales and depreciation are recorded for each segment and a selling  general and administrative expense sg a allocation is made based on an evaluation of each segment s utilization of our selling  support  and engineering resources 
in  we reclassified the document systems business unit that was previously part of document and label solutions to a separate operating segment included in other 
this change is in response to changes in the organizational structure of the company and a reevaluation of the aggregation criteria 
after the sale of insystems  our three reportable segments are document and label solutions  pod services  and digital solutions 
other includes our commercial print  document systems  international  and pathforward operating segments 
as a result of a review of design service revenue and the allocation of corporate selling  general  and administrative expense to our operating units  in  we made modifications that affect revenue between segments and the expense allocation to our segments 
segment profit and loss information for and has been revised from previously reported amounts to reflect the current presentation

see reconciliation to consolidated information on page document label solutions dls overall  dls revenue was million  below in  unit sales declined approximately and net prices averaged about higher than in the price gain was the net of two major factors increases to recover paper cost increases early in the year  and reductions due to reverse auctions and other aggressive pricing actions at a few large accounts 
in  revenue was up 
adjusting for the extra accounting week in  revenue increased approximately over the prior year 
pricing accounted for two thirds of the increase  again related to the paper costs 
the dls segment included million of label revenue in  which was up from the prior year 
adjusting for the extra accounting week in  label revenue is estimated to have increased approximately in versus we see opportunities for growth in pressure sensitive labels and related services  particularly in the manufacturing sector  and have recently streamlined our us label production and added capacity in mexico 
the remainder of the dls segment revenue includes custom printed documents  supplies  and distribution and other services 
revenue for these products and services was million in  down from adjusting for the extra accounting week in  revenue is estimated to have increased approximately in versus industry economics for much of traditional print is marked by declining demand due to technology substitutes  excess production capacity  and aggressive price competition 
notwithstanding these challenges  we believe that there will continue to be opportunities for good margin  cash flow  and return on investment in this product group  which will require market share penetration in targeted vertical markets where the company is well positioned  judicious capital investment in niche areas  and continuing improvements in cost and productivity 
it is noteworthy that these traditional print products and services are well established in a broad cross section of customers and provide a platform to launch our other products and services 
dls gross margin was of revenue in  down from and in the preceding two years 
although higher paper costs were substantially recovered in  the dollar gross margin decreased million from the prior year the net result of the decline in unit sales and the weaker pricing noted above at a few large accounts  offset in part by continued manufacturing cost reductions 
the million decrease in the gross margin similarly reflected declines in sales units and average pricing aside from that related to paper costs that exceeded manufacturing cost reductions 
operating income in was million  down in comparison to the million result reported for this is attributed primarily to the unit sales decrease and price concessions at a few large accounts 
the result remained higher than that for  primarily due to lower sg a expense versus as discussed below  we announced a restructuring plan in january  that included the closing of our middlebury  vermont printing plant 
the production capacity of the plant will be transferred to other plants over the next few quarters 
once transfers are complete  annualized savings are estimated to be million 
pod services pod services reported revenue of million in an increase versus the prior year 
unit growth accounted for about three fourths of this increase with the balance coming from higher selling prices  primarily related to the recovery of increased paper costs 
in  revenue decreased slightly from the prior year 
adjusting for the extra accounting week in  revenue is estimated to have increased approximately  primarily due to a modest increase in units which overcame some pricing weakness 
we believe there are good opportunities for growth in revenue and margins in this segment  and are stepping up its level of investment in digital printing equipment  personnel  and software 
much of the application software is proprietary  designed to improve both productivity and the customer experience 
digital print carries inherent advantages for certain print applications  in particular where there is risk of obsolescence with longer production runs  where each page benefits from carrying variable information  or where fast turnaround time is critical 
we provide digital printing services at locations throughout the united states 
gross margin improved significantly in up or million over the prior year 
the substantial increase in gross margin is attributed primarily to three major factors unit growth in digital print  gains made in selling design  programming  and other services  and improvements in manufacturing productivity 
the decrease in gross margin in relation to is attributed primarily to higher discounting and increased manufacturing costs 
higher sales volume and productivity boosted the operating results to a profit of million from a prior year loss of million  demonstrating this unit s significant operating leverage over its fixed cost base 
some additional margin improvement is possible with continuing growth in unit volumes  but we expect to invest additional capital and personnel in that will dampen near term gains in the operating margin percentage 
the decline in operating profit reflected the weaker gross margin discussed above  offset in part by lesser expense allocation 
digital solutions revenue was million in  about the same as in  and slightly higher than this start up venture is based on the application of digital writing technology that converts conventional handwriting on paper to standard digital format for automatic entry into software applications 
we have made significant investments in this venture over the last three years and believe there is a very good likelihood that a viable market will emerge for this technology 
we have elected to seek venture capital investment in order to continue the business plan and will likely spin this venture out and become a minority partner 
other operating segments other includes our commercial print  document systems  pathforward  and international operating segments 
commercial print revenue was million in  up over  and over beginning in  certain products previously included in dls revenue are now included in commercial print revenue 
if we had adjusted prior year amounts for this change  commercial print revenue would have increased over and over we apply our product expertise and sophisticated software tools to assist customers in managing their commercial print programs 
commercial print is sourced from third party printers 
the business model allows us to buy from the supplier and resell to the customer  or charge a fee for the management services 
we believe that our asset light  services based commercial print model will be well received by the market 
it is an integral part of our effort to provide our customers with a full range of products and services to meet their document needs 
the other major source of revenue in this category is document systems  which sells application software and services that facilitate the secure  on demand printing of business documents 
revenue in this operating segment was million in  versus million and million in and the document systems product portfolio is shifting from one primarily based on reselling document printing and handling equipment to one increasingly characterized by application software and services 
we believe our software is particularly well positioned to be an integral part of hospitals migration from paper based recordkeeping system to electronic medical record systems 
paper costs white bond paper costs rose twice during with year end pricing up approximately from the start of the year for rolls used by dls  and up about for cut sheet used primarily in pod services 
during  paper prices decreased slightly for rolls and ticked up slightly for cut sheet 
paper mill operating rates were reported in the range during  which were above rates and served to support the paper price hikes 
at this writing  the expectation is that mills will continue to reduce capacity during in an attempt to offset expected weakness in overall paper demand and pricing 
there are currently no price announcements in the market  however  pulp and energy costs  coupled with less supply  may push prices modestly higher in the second half of despite a competitive marketplace  the company has traditionally been successful in recovering all or most of the increases in paper costs 
recovery ordinarily occurs over a period of several quarters 
we would expect to increase our target selling prices and negotiate with our customers to recover any paper cost increases that might take place in impact of one large account the use of reverse auctions and aggressive bidding impacted revenue in price and unit reductions during at one large account in particular had a significant unfavorable effect  reducing annualized revenue and gross margin by approximately million and million  respectively 
about of this annualized impact was felt in with the balance spilling into the majority of the change impacts dls  but pod services and commercial print were also affected 
revenue notwithstanding the above account s impact and the general marketplace challenges  the company s growth initiatives are expected to produce overall revenue growth in the low to mid single digit range in selling  general  administrative expense our qualified pension plan became underfunded in as a result of declining interest rates and the weak stock market in and this significantly increased the amortization in subsequent years of these past pension asset and liability losses 
pension loss amortization has been significant million  million  and million  in   and  reducing earnings per share by   and  in the respective years 
the million increase in pension loss amortization is attributable to several factors discussed more fully under our critical accounting estimates 
approximately million from the reduction in the liability discount rate from to 
approximately million from a reduction in the estimated remaining working life of participants from years to years 
approximately million from the phased in recognition of actuarial losses over a five year period 
this produces a pattern of increasing amortization over the first five years following an actuarial loss 
we also incurred a million pension settlement loss in as a result of the relatively high lump sum retirement payouts made during the year from the nonqualifed retirement plan 
as a result of the pension obligation settlement  we recorded a non cash charge to record a pro rata portion of unrecognized net losses from prior periods 
considering our past actuarial gains and losses  including the losses in and  and given our current actuarial assumptions  we expect our pension amortization to peak in at approximately million and begin to decrease thereafter 
in total  consolidated sg a expenses increased million in excluding the pension items noted above  sg a expenses increased million 
the primary contributors to this increase were sales compensation  fringe costs  and increased information technology spending 
as previously mentioned  in the second quarter of  we reached a favorable settlement to an audit for unclaimed funds and reversed million of the reserve to sg a expense 
on the same basis  sg a expenses decreased million in from  primarily from a decrease in those same items 
the effect of adoption of sfas no 
r did not have a material effect on sg a expense 
as of december   there was a total of of share based compensation related to service based restricted stock that will be amortized to expense over a weighted average remaining service period of two years and a total of  of share based compensation related to performance based restricted stock that will be amortized to expense in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization continued to trend lower in million compared with million and million in the two preceding years 
the decrease reflects a strategic shift away from an asset intensive business model to one based increasingly on services 
annual capital spending in recent years has remained in the low to mid million range  compared to the mid million range in years prior to in addition  plant consolidations undertaken in recent years have had the effect of reducing excess capacity and equipment depreciation 
we plan to step up our capital spending in  particularly for digital print capacity and workflow software in our pod services business 
capital expenditures in are estimated in the million range and depreciation and amortization should be slightly below that reported in interest expense interest expense was million in  compared with million and million in and the reductions have been driven by lower average debt balances in each year as a result of our cash flow generation  somewhat offset by increased interest rates 
income taxes the effective tax rates were   and  for   and the table below details the major items that impacted the rates in each of the years 
pre tax income loss on continuing operations income tax expense benefit major reconciling items state rate changes charitable contributions expiration capital loss valuation allowance equity compensation permanent other items income tax expense benefit  adjusted for reconciling items in  we reduced our deferred tax asset by million for the value of charitable contributions that will not be realized as a tax deduction due to their expiration 
in addition  a tax valuation allowance of million was established in connection with a capital loss that will likely not be offset by future capital gains 
finally  the deferred tax asset was reduced by million to recognize the lower deduction available to the company as a result of the decrease in the value of the company s stock since certain restricted shares that vested in were granted 
excluding these and other items  the effective tax rate was 
in june  the state of ohio enacted new tax legislation that had the effect of eliminating million of the company s tax loss carry forwards carried in deferred tax 
the effect of this change in tax rates on future periods is not material 
income loss from continuing operations as indicated in the following table  operating income before restructuring expense  impairment expense  pension loss amortization  and pension settlement losses was down slightly in million vs 
million in the prior year 
the gains achieved from the higher gross margin and lower depreciation was eclipsed by increased sg a spending 
on the same basis  was million above the result  driven primarily by lower sg a spending and lower depreciation 
the following table reconciles these amounts to income loss from continuing operations and net income on a gaap basis

restructuring and asset impairment at the end of  all of our current restructuring actions were completed 
pre tax components of restructuring charges are as follows restructuring actions severance and employer related costs associated costs total restructuring actions severance and employer related costs total restructuring actions severance and employer related costs contract exit and termination costs associated costs total restructuring actions contract exit and termination costs associated costs total restructuring actions contract exit and termination costs total total restructuring charges restructuring within the dls segment  we closed our terre haute  indiana  label production plant 
the plant s productive capacity was transferred to three other plants in the united states to improve overall efficiency and lower operating costs 
restructuring costs incurred included severance and employer related costs and other associated costs directly related to the restructuring  primarily equipment removal and relocation 
pre tax components of restructuring expense are as follows total costs total expected to be restructuring incurred expense severance and employer related costs associated costs total a summary of the restructuring accrual activity is as follows charged to incurred balance accrual in severance and employer related costs total restructuring within the pod services segment  we closed one printing center  moving production to other facilities and outsourcing envelope production 
we also closed a warehouse in the dls segment 
costs incurred were primarily severance and employer related costs 
pre tax components of restructuring charges are as follows total costs total cumulative expected to date to be restructuring restructuring incurred expense expense severance and employer related costs other exit costs total by segment document and label solutions pod services total a summary of the restructuring accrual activity is as follows charged to incurred balance incurred balance accrual in in severance and employer related costs total restructuring in  we initiated several restructuring actions as part of a drive to reduce costs 
we integrated our sales specialist organization with our regional sales organization to improve coordination  resource deployment  and productivity  adjusted our client services model to improve efficiency  and went to a shared service model in various administrative areas to reduce costs 
we also outsourced part of our information technology operations  including hardware management  help desk support  and telecommunications 
as a result of all these actions  we eliminated a significant number of positions  including four executive officer positions 
costs incurred included severance and employer related costs  including outplacement and healthcare allowances  lease termination costs for one sales office  including contractual obligations for taxes  utilities  and maintenance costs  and associated travel and moving costs related to the restructuring actions 
approximately million and million of expense was reversed in and  respectively  as a result of lower than expected severance and healthcare benefits for certain associates 
the majority of the million reversal in was related to the reversal of an accrual established for severance related to the outsourcing of information technology operations in we had agreed to pay severance to associates whose positions were subsequently eliminated and the number of positions eliminated was less than expected 
pre tax components of restructuring actions are as follows total expense total cumulative expected to date to be restructuring restructuring incurred expense expense severance and employer related costs contract termination costs associated costs total by segment document and label solutions pod services other total a summary of the restructuring accrual activity is as follows charged to incurred reversed balance charged to incurred reversed balance incurred balance accrual in in accrual in in in severance and employer related costs contract termination costs total and restructuring restructuring expense recorded in   and for these actions is primarily related to vacated facilities  as the amount accrued is net of any expected sublease income and the company was unable to sublease the remaining facilities 
no additional expense is remaining related to these facilities 
a summary of the restructuring accrual activity is as follows charged to incurred reversed balance incurred reversed balance incurred reversed balance incurred balance accrual in in in in in in in severance and employer related costs contract termination costs total asset impairment and net assets held for sale in conjunction with the closing of the terre haute plant  in we recorded million of asset impairments  primarily related to equipment 
the carrying value of the terre haute building and equipment was adjusted to its fair value less costs to sell  considering recent sales of similar properties and real estate valuations 
other equipment was determined to have no fair value and was disposed of 
as of december   the terre haute building was classified as held for sale and subsequently sold in january subsequent event in  the company is taking steps to align its supply chain with market opportunities and customer needs 
we plan to organize and consolidate our manufacturing and distribution capabilities to become more efficient in meeting customer needs 
on january   we adopted a restructuring plan to accomplish these objectives 
the actions associated with the plan are expected to be completed in in connection with this plan  on january   we announced that we will close our facility in middlebury  vermont  and transfer equipment and production operations to three other plants 
the middlebury plant  which employs about people  will continue to perform limited production through may we expect to record approximately million of restructuring costs in the dls segment in related to the closing of the middlebury plant 
restructuring costs will include million for employee related costs and million of other associated exit costs  primarily equipment removal and relocation 
at december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that a plant would be closed in the dls segment which caused us to perform an impairment test on the long lived assets 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million  primarily related to equipment 
environmental matters we have been named as one of a number of potentially responsible parties at several waste disposal sites  none of which has ever been company owned 
our policy is to accrue for investigation and remediation at sites where costs are probable and estimable 
at this writing  there are no identified environmental liabilities that are expected to have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition  or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources our discussion of liquidity and capital resources will include an analysis of our cash flows and capital structure  which include both continuing and discontinued operations  plus a summary of our significant contractual obligations 
this discussion also presents financial measures that are considered non gaap 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance  financial position  or cash flows where amounts are either excluded or included not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the presentation of non gaap information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in particular  we will segregate and highlight cash flows related to restructuring and contributions to our qualified pension plan  both of which are carefully monitored by management and have a significant and variable impact on cash flow 
in addition  because our outstanding debt is borrowed under a revolving credit agreement which currently permits us to borrow and repay at will up to a balance of million  we take th e measure of cash flow performance prior to debt borrowing or repayment  in effect  we evaluate cash flow as the change in net debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents 
the major elements of the statements of cash flows are summarized below cash inflow outflow net income plus non cash items change in accounts receivable change in inventories change in accounts payable accrued liabilities restructuring payments contributions to qualified pension plan other pension postretirement payments income taxes change in other assets liabilities net cash provided by operating activities acquisitions capital expenditures proceeds from sale of plant and equipment proceeds from sale of discontinued operations proceeds from additions to investments net cash used for investing activities debt borrowings payments dividends paid proceeds from issuance of common stock purchase of treasury stock debt issuance costs net cash used for financing activities exchange rate differences net change in cash memo add back debt borrowed paid cash flow before change in debt the company generated positive cash flow  before debt borrowing and repayments  of million and million in and  respectively 
in contrast  witnessed a cash outflow before borrowing of million 
capital expenditures and dividends were approximately the same in each of the three years 
the major difference in was that pension funding was twice the average of the prior two years  and accounts receivable were higher 
operating activities cash provided from operations was million in  compared with million and million for and  respectively 
major contributing factors identified in the table above are discussed below 
net income plus non cash items for was lower than in  but well above reflecting the year to year changes in operating profitability discussed earlier under results of operations 
the million increase in accounts receivable was primarily a function of expected december payments from five accounts that were received just after the year end cut off  plus an increase in december s revenue over the prior december 
restructuring payments have declined in each successive year 
the restructuring announced in january   will result in approximately million in cash outflows in contributions to the company s qualified pension plan were million in  up significantly versus the million and million in the preceding two years 
we plan to make voluntary contributions of million per year for the next several years in order to move the plan toward fully funded status 
investing activities capital spending has remained in a narrow range in each of the years 
we expect capital expenditures to be in the million range in  primarily focused on pod services equipment and software 
financing activities dividend payments were consistent in each year 
the company has paid a quarterly dividend since going public in  the quarterly dividend has remained at per share since the first quarter capital structure our capital structure appears in the table below capital structure total debt less cash and short term investments net debt equity total net debt total capital the million cash outflow described earlier for is reflected in the increase in net debt shown in the table above 
shareholders equity decreased million during this change primarily reflects the million net loss  million in dividend payments  and the change in accounting that establishes postretirement benefit liabilities on the basis of projected rather than accumulated obligations that reduced shareholders equity million 
the company currently has a million senior secured revolving credit agreement credit facility with seven banks that permits borrowing and repayment as needed throughout the year 
the credit facility  which expires in may   is secured by accounts receivable  inventories  and certain other assets 
there is a fixed charge coverage covenant test that becomes applicable if the sum of available unborrowed credit plus certain cash balances falls below million 
at year end  outstanding borrowings under the credit facility were million and unborrowed credit was million  net of letters of credit 
interest on the revolver is at the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable spread based on the sum of available unborrowed credit plus certain cash balances 
the weighted average interest rate  including the spread  was at december  in addition  the company pays a fee on the unused portion of the credit facility  currently the fee is basis points 
we believe that the combination of internally generated funds  available cash reserves  and our existing credit facility are sufficient to fund our operations  including capital expenditures  dividends  and investments in growth initiatives over the next year 
in our judgment  our strong balance sheet could support additional debt financing 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  some of the amounts we included in this table are based on estimates and assumptions about our obligations  and the amounts we actually pay in the future may vary from the amounts reflected below 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase commitments pension plans postretirement benefit obligation total the debt payment information represents amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit 
the pension plan obligations included in the table above represent benefit payments for to under the nonqualifed defined benefit plans that are unfunded 
the postretirement benefit obligation included in the table above represents healthcare benefit payments expected to be paid for future claims under the plan for to we are obligated under operating leases for real estate  sales offices  transportation equipment  and computer and other equipment 
in accordance with gaap  the obligations under these operating leases are not recorded on our balance sheet 
purchase commitments for capital improvements aggregated million at december  we have commitments with equipment suppliers to spend a total of million over multiple years 
we also have multiple years remaining on commitments with software companies for total annual license maintenance fees of million 
in addition  we have purchase commitments for telecommunications services from suppliers that provide for minimum annual commitments of million in we outsource certain information technology services from suppliers under multi year agreements that provide for early termination penalties 
at december   the early termination penalties total approximately million 
the remaining terms of the agreements range from one to four years 
as these remaining terms diminish  the amount of the termination penalties decline 
we have no purchase agreements with suppliers extending beyond normal quantity requirements 
our near term cash requirements are primarily related to funding our operations and capital expenditures 
future cash requirements of our recently announced restructuring programs are approximately million in we do not expect to have a minimum pension funding requirement in  although we plan to make at least a million voluntary contribution to our defined benefit pension plan 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter inventory pricing 
sfas no 
requires idle facility costs  abnormal freight  handling costs  and amounts of wasted materials spoilage be treated as current period costs 
under this concept  if the costs associated with the actual level of spoilage or production defects are greater than the costs associated with the range of normal spoilage or defects  the difference would be charged to current period expense  not included in inventory costs 
sfas no 
also requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
sfas no 
requires  unless impracticable  retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle where transition is not specified by a new accounting pronouncement 
sfas no 
also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
effective december   we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
sfas no 
requires a company with a defined benefit plan and other postretirement plans to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation in its statement of financial position 
for a pension plan  the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation  for other postretirement benefit plans  the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
the new standard also requires the benefit obligations be measured as of the same date of the consolidated financial statements  which the company already complies with  and requires additional disclosures 
the effect of adopting sfas no 
on our consolidated financial position at december   is further described in notes and the adoption of this standard did not have an effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in as of december   we adopted securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab requires the quantification of misstatements based on their impact to both the balance sheet and the income statement to determine materiality 
the guidance provides for a one time cumulative effect adjustment to correct for misstatements for errors that were not deemed material under a prior approach but are material under the sab approach 
the adoption of sab did not have an effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin establishes that the financial statement effects of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return are to be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examination 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and is required to be adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal the cumulative effects  if any  of applying fin will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoptio n 
we are currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on its consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
based upon our analysis completed to date  we expect a reduction in retained earnings between million and million 
this estimate is subject to revision as we complete our analysis 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which applies under most other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas no 
provides a common definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a transaction between market participants 
the new standard also provides guidance on the methods used to measure fair value and requires expanded disclosures related to fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we will adopt this statement in fiscal year and are currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates on our borrowings under our credit facility 
at december  we had million borrowed against the credit facility 
payment of interest on libor contracts is at an annual rate equal to the libor rate plus an applicable margin based on the sum of available unborrowed credit plus certain cash balances 
payment of interest on base rate loans is based on the prime rate 
the weighted average interest rate  including the spread  was at december  a hypothetical basis point movement in the prevailing interest rates on the million of borrowings under the credit facility would result in a million annualized effect on our interest expense 
foreign currency prior to the sale of insystems  we were exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and utilized derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to such fluctuations 
our risk management objective was to minimize the effects of volatility on our cash flows by identifying the assets  liabilities or forecasted transactions exposed to these risks and hedging them with forward contracts or by embedding terms into certain contracts that affect the ultimate amount of cash flows under the contract 
since there was a high correlation between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures  the gains and losses on these exposures were generally offset by reciprocal changes in value of the hedging instruments when used 
we used derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading or speculative purposes 
commodity prices paper is the principal raw material in the production of business forms 
because we have historically been successful in adjusting our sales prices in response to changes in paper costs  we do not believe a change in paper costs would have a material effect on our financial statements  however  an increase of in paper costs  if not recovered by us  would increase cost of sales by approximately million
