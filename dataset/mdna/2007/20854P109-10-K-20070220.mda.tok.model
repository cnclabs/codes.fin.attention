item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general net income for the period declined in comparison to the period primarily due to the period gain on the sale of of cnx gas 
in august  cnx gas  a subsidiary of consol energy  sold million shares of common stock 
cnx gas received proceeds of million  which it used to pay a special dividend to consol energy 
the pre tax gain recognized on this transaction was million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  no deferred tax has been provided on this transaction as current tax law provides a means by which the excess of the reported amount of this investment over its tax basis can be recovered tax free 
also  management has no current intention of entering into a transaction that would cause cnx gas to leave the consolidated tax group 
net income was also impacted by the acceleration of previously unrecognized actuarial losses related to our salary pension plan 
our defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution for the benefits earned through december  in lieu of annual payments when they retire from consol energy 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  requires that when the lump sum distributions made for a plan year  which for consol energy is october to september  exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year  an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year be recognized 
the total pre tax accelerated actuarial amortization was million and was included in costs of goods sold and other charges and selling  general and administrative costs 
these decreases in net income were offset  in part  by million of property and business interruption insurance proceeds recognized in other income related to the buchanan mine fire and skip hoist incident that occurred in net income was also impacted by increased average sales prices for both coal and gas 
coal unit costs increased in the period to period comparison  impairing net income 
increased cost of goods sold and other charges were also attributable to higher supply costs  contract mining fees  labor costs  subsidence costs  and higher insurance premiums 
higher gas unit costs were primarily attributable to higher firm transportation costs and higher power costs 
total coal sales for the year ended december  were million tons  of which million tons were produced by consol energy operations  consolidated variable interest entities  or sold from inventory of company produced coal 
this compares with total coal sales of million tons for the year ended december   of which million tons were produced by consol energy operations  consolidated variable interest entities  our equity affiliates or sold from inventory of company produced coal 
sales of company produced coal decreased in the period due to lower coal production causing fewer tons to be available for sale 
company produced coal production was million tons in the period compared to million tons in the period 
the period production was lower primarily due to the idling of shoemaker mine early in the year and the long term idling of the vp mine in virginia in the spring of in addition  geological conditions at several mines resulted in falls on major beltlines during the high humidity season as well as sandstone and rock intrusions in the areas being mined 
produced coalbed methane gas sales volumes  including a percentage of the sales of equity affiliates equal to our interest in these affiliates  increased to billion cubic feet in the period compared with billion cubic feet in the period 
sales volumes in the period increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program 
our average sales price for coalbed methane gas  including sales of equity affiliates  increased to per thousand cubic feet in the period compared with per thousand cubic feet in the period 
the increase in average sales price is a result of cnx gas  an owned subsidiary  exposing a larger portion of sales volumes to prevailing market prices in the current period compared to the prior period  where a larger portion of production was locked in at lower prices than the current period market prices 
mine accidents involving multiple fatalities occurred earlier this year in west virginia at mines operated by other coal companies 
these accidents attracted widespread public attention and have resulted in both federal 
table of contents government and some state government changes to statutory and regulatory control of mine safety  particularly for underground mines 
because nearly all of our mines are underground  these legislative and regulatory changes could affect our performance 
the actions taken thus far by federal and state governments include requiring the caching of additional supplies of self contained self rescuer scsr devices underground  the purchase and installation during the next several years of electronic communication and personal tracking devices underground  the installation  in some states of rescue chambers  structures designed to provide refuge for groups of miners for long periods of time during a mine emergency when evacuation from the mine is not possible  and additional training and testing requirements that are expected to create a need to hire additional employees 
in reviewing actions taken to date  we estimate that implementation of the new requirements could cost million to million from until the end of the actual costs will depend primarily on the number of additional scsr oxygen units purchased  the design requirements as well as the extent of deployment of rescue chambers  final interpretation of other regulatory requirements  and final approval of mine by mine implementation plans 
a large part of the estimated additional costs are related to the purchase of additional scsr oxygen units 
we did incur costs related to these regulatory requirements during the reporting period 
we also are reviewing our coal sales agreements to determine the degree to which costs related to these regulatory requirements may be passed through to customers 
while the amount will vary from contract  we believe that some portion of the cost of implementation can be passed to the customer in most of our existing sales agreements 
at december   consol energy and its subsidiaries had  employees  of whom were represented by the united mine workers 
a new five year labor agreement was reached in december and commences january  the new agreement expires december  and provides for a across the board wage increase over its duration and a  bonus to be paid immediately to the union s active miners 
wages will go up per hour in  per hour in and 
per hour for through other terms of the agreement require an average additional contribution of per hour to be made into the employee benefit funds over the contract term 
the hourly contribution for each year is as follows  for  for  for  for and for full health care benefits for active land retired members and their dependents will continue with no increase in co payments 
newly employed inexperienced employees represented by the umwa  hired after january  will not be eligible to receive retiree benefits 
in lieu of these benefits  these employees will receive a defined contribution benefit of per each hour worked 
the agreement replaced the bituminous coal wage agreement of on september   standard poor s raised our corporate credit rating to bb from bb 
the rating bb is the th lowest out of rating categories 
standard poor s also raised our senior secured notes to bb from bb 
the rating bb is the th lowest out of rating categories 
standard poor s defines an obligation rated bb as less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues 
however  the rating indicates that an obligor faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business  financial or economic conditions  which could lead to the obligor s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
on september   moody s raised our senior secured notes to ba from ba this is the th lowest out of rating categories 
obligations which are rated ba are considered to have speculative elements  their future cannot be considered as well assured 
often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate  and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future 
uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class 
the modifier indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category 

table of contents on may   consol energy s board of directors declared a two for one stock split of the common stock payable on or about may  to shareholders of record on may  the stock split was effected in the form of a stock dividend 
this stock split resulted in the issuance of approximately million additional shares of common stock 
the stock split also resulted in additional shares being available for awards under the consol energy inc equity incentive plan

variance percentage change produced tons sold in millions average sales price per ton increased average sales price primarily reflects stronger prices negotiated in and early resulting from an overall improvement in prices in the eastern coal market for domestic and foreign power generators and steel producers 
sales of company produced coal decreased in the period due to lower company production causing fewer tons to be available for sale 
company produced coal production was million tons in the period compared to million tons in the period 
the decrease in company purchased coal sales revenue was due to lower sales tons in the period compared to the period  offset  in part  by increased average sales price per ton of purchased coal 
variance percentage change purchased tons sold in millions average sales price per ton 
table of contents higher average sales prices were primarily due to sales of purchased coal tons being sold in higher priced export and metallurgical markets 
the increase in gas sales revenue was due to a higher average sales price per thousand cubic feet sold and increased volumes in the period compared to the period 
variance percentage change produced gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet including effects of derivative transactions the increase in average sales price is primarily the result of selling the majority of our current year production at market rates that were higher than the prices we sold our gas under hedging contracts in the prior year 
cnx gas enters into physical fixed price gas supply transactions with various counterparties for terms varying in length 
cnx gas also enters into financial gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges 
these financial gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
these physical and financial hedges represented approximately of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per mcf 
in the prior year  these hedges represented approximately of our produced gas sales volumes at an average price of per mcf 
sales volumes increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program and the period sales volumes being negatively impacted by the shutdown of buchanan mine due to the mine fire 
variance percentage change gas royalty interest sales volumes in billion cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet included in royalty interest gas sales are the revenues related to the portion of production associated with royalty interest owners

eitf requires the combining of matching buy sell transactions  done in contemplation of one another  that were committed to on or after january  the net result for transactions that meet the above criteria are reflected in transportation expense in the current year 
additionally  there are low volumes of gas we purchase from third party producers at market prices less our gathering charge  which we then resell 
the million increase in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was primarily due to increased sales volumes and higher average sales prices 

table of contents the million increase in other sales was primarily attributable to revenues from river barge towing 
consol energy has an initiative to increase towing revenues from outside parties now that we are no longer restricted under the jones act bowater exemption 
prior to february  foreign ownership of consol energy exceeded  prohibiting us from providing river barge towing to third parties 
in january  consol energy completed the acquisition of mon river towing and jar barge line  llc  which contributed to the increase in revenues 
freight revenue is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation ie  rail  barge  truck  etc 
used for the customers to which consol energy contractually provides transportation services 
freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred 
in july  consol energy announced that it created cnx gas corporation  cnx gas as a wholly owned subsidiary of consol energy  to conduct its gas exploration and production activities

the million was recognized as other income  coal segment recognized million and gas segment recognized million 
we had received and recognized as other income million of insurance proceeds in the period 
we have received a total of million from the insurance companies since the incident occurred 
no additional reimbursement from the insurance carriers related to this claim will be recovered 
buchanan mine also experienced a problem with the mine s skip hoist mechanism on september  which caused the mine to be idled 
repairs to the skip hoist shaft and structures were completed and the mine resumed production on december  consol energy filed an insurance claim for reimbursement of various costs and business interruption related to the skip incident at buchanan mine 
during the year ended december   consol energy recognized proceeds from the insurance companies of million 
the million was recognized as other income  coal segment recognized million and gas segment recognized million 
no additional reimbursement from the insurance carriers related to this claim will be recovered 
royalty income has increased due primarily to increased gas prices and additional production on existing royalty contracts 
royalty income received from third parties is calculated as a percentage of the third party sales price 

table of contents interest income increased due to our improved cash position throughout compared to the improved cash position was primarily due to the august sale of interest in cnx gas 
the private sale of this stock resulted in million of proceeds 
service income represents various miscellaneous revenues from coal fines recovery projects  processing fees for third party coal and other miscellaneous activities 
the increase in revenues is attributable to new agreements with third parties which allow them to recover coal fines from preparation slurry ponds for a fee 
the decrease in gain on sale of assets in the period reflects various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
the equity in income of affiliates decreased in the period to period comparison due primarily to consol energy s portion of a period gain on sale of land by an affiliate 
other income from the harmar environmental trust the trust settlement was attributable to the civil division of the court of common pleas of allegheny county s decision to terminate a trust among consol energy and other parties 
the trust was established in to provide funding for water treatment related to the now closed harmar mine 
other parties funded the trust 
consol energy was responsible to complete water treatment activities  but all costs associated with these activities were funded by the trust agreement 
any excess funding upon completion of water treatment or a specified date in the future was to be distributed to parties that originally funded the trust 
in the decision  all previously funded  but unused  amounts remaining in the trust were distributed 
consol energy s portion of the distributed funds was million 
consol energy is responsible for the ongoing water treatment at this facility 
consol energy recorded the funds and the present value of the water treatment liability resulting in million of income in the period

costs dollar variance percentage change cost of goods sold and other charges produced coal purchased coal produced gas gas royalty interest purchased gas industrial supplies closed and idle mines other total cost of goods sold increased cost of goods sold and other charges for company produced coal were due mainly to a increase in cost per ton of produced coal sold and a decrease in sales volumes 
variance percentage change produced tons sold in millions average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton 
table of contents costs of goods sold and other charges for produced tons sold increased due mainly to an acceleration of previously unrecognized actuarial losses related to our salary pension plan

statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  requires that when the lump sum distributions made for a plan year  which for consol energy is october to september  exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year  an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year be recognized 
the total accelerated actuarial amortization was million  of which impacted costs of goods sold and other charges for produced coal 
increased cost of goods sold and other charges were also attributable to higher supply costs  contract mining fees  labor costs  subsidence costs  and higher insurance premiums 
higher supply costs were attributable to additional maintenance projects and increased cost for electrical products  petroleum products and chemicals  such as diesel fuel and magnetite used in the mining and coal preparation process 
supply costs have also increased due to additional costs being incurred related to the adoption of new safety regulations  as previously discussed 
increased contract mining fees were attributable to increased fees negotiated with the contractors used primarily in our central appalachian operations 
increased labor costs were attributable to increased employee counts and increased wages at certain mining operations 
employee counts have been increased in certain locations to maintain development rates ahead of the longwall mining units 
new employees have also been added as trainees who will replace skilled employees expected to retire between now and the end of the decade 
increased employee counts were also necessary to maintain underground belt haulage systems and complete additional roof and rib support 
additional roof and rib support requirements have been necessary due to changes in underground geology and mining conditions 
labor rates were increased in order to stay competitive in certain labor markets 
higher subsidence costs reflect higher costs related to the pennsylvania department environmental protection regulation titled surface water protection underground bituminous coal mining operation 
the application of this regulation requires additional costs when mining may affect perennial and intermittent streams 
subsidence costs also increased due to the location of mining activities affecting more surface structures in the period than in the period 
higher insurance premiums are attributable to higher costs of property damage and business interruption coverage in the period compared to the period 
these increases in costs were offset  in part  by lower other post employment benefit costs  workers compensation costs and combined fund costs 
other post employment benefit costs were lower in the period compared to the period due to consol energy s plan amendment removing the election of the federal subsidy provision of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
instead  we will coordinate benefits with available medicare coverage considered the primary payer 
medicare is considered the primary payer under our plan 
this plan amendment resulted in a reduction of the accumulated projected benefit obligation and will be amortized to earnings 
workers compensation expenses have been reduced due to lower state administrative fees charged by the state of west virginia due to changes in that state s workers compensation program 
unit costs were also improved due to lower combined fund costs as a result of lower monthly premiums as well as lower sales volumes in the period to period comparison 
purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges decreased in the period compared to the period 
variance percentage change purchased tons sold in millions average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton the higher average cost of purchased coal is primarily due to overall increases in prices for domestic coals 

table of contents produced gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to increased sales volumes and higher unit costs 
variance percentage change produced gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet average cost per thousand cubic feet the increase in average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold was primarily attributable to firm transportation 
firm transportation costs increased approximately per thousand cubic feet in the period to period comparison 
approximately per thousand cubic feet of the firm transportation increase is the result of the application of eitf  accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty as of january  eitf requires the combining of matching buy sell transactions  done in contemplation of one another  committed to on or after january  the net result for transactions that meet the above criteria are reflected in transportation expense in the current year 
previously  these transactions were accounted for as purchased gas revenue and purchased gas expense 
approximately per thousand cubic feet of the increase in firm transportation was due to additional fees to purchase firm transportation capacity on the tco interstate pipeline in order to avoid potential curtailments on portions of shipment capacity allocated to cnx gas 
the potential curtailments are due to increased demand for pipeline access in the period 
unit costs also increased due to higher power costs 
power costs per unit were per thousand cubic feet higher due to both increased megawatt hour rates charged by our power provider and the use of more electric compressors during the current year that were previously powered by gas for most of the prior year 
salary and wages have also increased approximately per thousand cubic feet due to additional staffing added to achieve desired drilling and production results 
unit costs have increased due to an additional per thousand cubic feet related to leasing and brokering of land 
produced gas cost of goods sold per unit also increased by per thousand cubic feet due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
these increases in unit costs were offset  in part  by lower well maintenance costs per unit 
maintenance costs per unit decreased per thousand cubic feet in the period to period comparison 
this improvement was due to maintenance projects being accelerated in prior periods 
the improvement was also due to efficiencies in the water collection infrastructure being realized subsequent to the improvements that were made in the prior year 
well maintenance costs per unit also decreased due to additional production in the period to period comparison 
variance percentage change gas royalty interest sales volumes in billion cubic feet average cost per thousand cubic feet included in royalty interest gas costs are the expenses related to the portion of production associated with royalty interest owners

table of contents january   purchased gas sales and volumes have decreased 
the net result for transactions that meet the above criteria are reflected in transportation expense in the current period 
the decrease in costs per unit is a function of the average sales price  before the effects of financial swap transactions  being higher in the prior year than in the current year 
additionally  there were small volumes of gas we purchase from third party producers at market prices less our gathering charge  which we then resell 
industrial supplies cost of goods sold increased million primarily due to higher sales volumes and higher unit costs 
closed and idle mine cost of goods sold increased million in the period compared to the period 
these expenses increased million due to shoemaker mine  vp mine and various other locations being idle for the majority of the period 
these locations were in production for the full period 
the increase was also attributable to higher expenses related to mine closing  perpetual care water treatment and reclamation liability adjustments that were the result of updated engineering surveys 
survey adjustments resulted in million of additional expense in the period for closed and idled locations compared to the results of the survey adjustment in the period 
closed and idle mine cost of good sold and other charges also increased million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material

consol energy temporarily sealed the mine in order to extinguish the fire that developed after the ignition 
various materials  including nitrogen foam and water were pumped into the mine in order to accelerate the process of creating an inert environment within the mine to extinguish the fire 
coal production resumed on june  costs of goods sold incurred for the buchanan mine fire  net of expected insurance recovery  for the year ended december  were million 
the incident was covered under consol energy s property and business interruption insurance policy as previously discussed 
on september   consol energy s buchanan mine also had an accident with its skip hoist  the device that lifts coal from underground to the surface  forcing the mine to suspend coal production 
the braking mechanism on the hoist failed to hold a loaded skip at the surface before it could dump its load 
the loaded skip fell approximately  feet back through the shaft to the bottom 
simultaneously  the empty skip was propelled upward to the surface as the loaded skip fell  causing the empty skip to strike the top of the hoist mechanism 
table of contents before also falling back to the shaft bottom 
expenses related to clean up of the damaged hoist for the year ended december   were approximately million 
this accident was covered under our property and business interruption insurance policy 
in the period  agreements were made to buy out sales contracts with several customers in order to release tons committed under lower priced contracts for sale to other customers at higher pricing 
no such agreements were made in the period 
litigation settlements and contingencies in the period were attributable to a settlement agreement with certain lessors in western kentucky 
the settlement agreement included the transfer of certain properties and permits  as well as a cash payment to the lessors  with the lessors assuming all reclamation liability for the mine property which is being transferred 
various other contingencies were incurred in both periods  none of which were individually material 
incentive compensation expense decreased due to a lower amount projected to be paid to employees for the period compared to the period 
the lower amount expected to be paid to employees is due to consol energy falling short of the predetermined earnings level under the plan 
the incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when consol energy reaches predetermined earnings targets and the employees reach predetermined performance targets 
bank fees decreased primarily due to no borrowings on our credit facility being made throughout the period 
accounts receivable securitization fees decreased in the period to period comparison 
no amounts have been drawn under this program in the period 
lower coal property holding costs were attributable to decreased expenses related to leasehold surrenders in the current period 
consol energy has an initiative to increase towing revenues for outside parties now that we are no longer restricted under the jones act bowater exemption 
prior to february  foreign ownership of consol energy exceeded  prohibiting us from providing river barge towing to third parties 
this initiative to increase revenues has also increased costs 
in january  consol energy completed the acquisition of mon river towing and jar barge lines  llc  which also contributed to the increase in costs 
effective january   consol energy adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
stock based compensation expense now includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january  the grant date fair value is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term 
prior to implementing sfas r  consol energy followed previously issued accounting guidance which did not require compensation expense to be recognized for stock option awards 
also  in april  consol energy began to issue restricted stock units as part of its equity incentive plan 
compensation cost for the restricted stock units is based upon the closing share price at the date of grant and is recognized over the vesting period of the units 
the increase in stock based compensation expense in the period is also due to additional compensation costs for restricted stock unit grants that occurred in the period 
miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges decreased due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material

assets placed in service after the period include various airshafts  longwall assets  haulage assets and various other projects completed at our mines 
the increase in gas production related depreciation  depletion and amortization was primarily due to the net effect of additional volumes in the current year and a slightly lower unit of production rate in compared to rates are generally calculated using the net book value of assets at january  divided by either proved or proved developed reserves 
gathering depreciation  depletion and amortization is recorded on the straight line method and increased due to additional assets being placed in service in  including the effects of the jewell ridge lateral pipeline 
the jewell ridge lateral pipeline was completed in october cnx gas entered into a year firm transportation agreement with etng  a subsidiary of duke energy  at pre determined fixed rates 
the present value of the payments under this firm transportation agreement is approximately million 
in addition to providing us with transportation flexibility  the jewell ridge lateral will provide access for our production to growing southeastern and east coal markets

in august  cnx gas  a subsidiary of consol energy  sold million shares in a private transaction 
cnx gas received proceeds of million  which it used to pay a special dividend to consol energy 
the proceeds received less the financial basis in the assets and liabilities given up by consol energy were recognized as a gain on sale of a subsidiary s stock in the year ended december  the pre tax gain recognized on this transaction was million

also  management has no current intention of entering into a transaction that would cause cnx gas to leave the consolidated tax group 
earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting were also improved due to increased average sales prices for both coal and gas and increased volume of produced coal sold 
these increases were offset  in part  by costs related to the buchanan mine fire and by higher cost per units sold for both coal and gas 
higher coal unit costs were primarily due to increased supply costs  higher labor costs  higher contractor mining fees and higher other post employment benefits 
higher gas unit costs were primarily due to increased royalty expense  imbalance charges and firm transportation expenses 
net income in the period included a cumulative effect of change in 
table of contents accounting related to workers compensation 
effective january   consol energy changed our method of accounting for workers compensation 
prior to the change  consol energy recorded our workers compensation liability on an undiscounted basis 
under the new method  consol energy records our liability on a discounted basis 
revenue revenue and other income increased due to the following items dollar variance percentage change sales produced coal outside and related party purchased coal produced gas gas royalty interest purchased gas industrial supplies other total sales freight revenue gain on sale of of cnx gas other income total revenue and other income the increase in company produced coal sales revenue  including related party  during the period was due mainly to the increase in average sales price per ton and increased sales volumes 
variance percentage change produced tons sold in millions average sales price per ton the increase in average sales price primarily reflects stronger prices negotiated in and early resulting from an overall improvement in prices in the eastern coal market for domestic and foreign power generators and steel producers 
the increase was also attributable to pricing premiums due to improved quality on coal shipments 
the increase in tons sold was due primarily to increased production at mcelroy  loveridge  bailey  the reactivation of emery mine in august and the opening of the miller creek complex in october these production increases were offset  in part  by a decrease in tons sold due to lower production at buchanan and various contractor locations 
the mcelroy production increase is related to running two longwall mining units in the period compared to running one longwall mining unit in the period 
the loveridge production increase is due to the mine operating for the full twelve months of the period compared to only a portion of the period due to the fire at this location in bailey production increases were due to increased productivity in the period to period comparison 
buchanan production decreased in the period due to a fire that developed in the mine after a large rock fall behind the longwall mining section on february  the mine was temporarily sealed in order to extinguish the fire 
buchanan resumed production on june  on september   buchanan experienced an accident with the skip hoist which brings the coal from underground to the surface 
the mine was idled until repairs to the skip hoist were completed 
the mine resumed production on december  
table of contents company purchased coal sales revenue remained consistent in the period to period comparison due to an increase in average sales price per ton of purchased coal  offset by reduced sales volumes 
variance percentage change purchased tons sold in millions average sales price per ton the increased average sales price is primarily due to sales of purchased coal tons being sold in higher priced export and metallurgical markets 
increased revenue from higher average sales prices were offset by lower sales volumes of purchased coal in the period compared to the period 
the increase in produced gas sales revenue was due to a higher average sales price per thousand cubic feet sold in the period compared to the period 
variance percentage change produced gas sales volumes in billion gross cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet including effects of derivative transactions we believe the gas market price increases were largely driven by continued concerns over levels of north american gas production  as well as increased oil prices and favorable economic conditions in the united states that encourage demand for natural gas 
the adverse affect of the hurricane season also shut in significant portions of gulf coast gas  increasing the tight supply  and leading to even higher prices in consol energy enters into various physical gas swap transactions with both gas marketers and other counterparties for terms varying in length 
consol energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges 
these gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
these physical and financial hedges represented approximately of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
the increase in sales volumes were a result of additional volumes coming on line from our ongoing drilling program  and by successfully initiating a frac well enhancement and stimulation program on wells unaffected by the mine fire 
this increase was offset by the loss of approximately billion cubic feet of gas related to the buchanan mine incident and billion cubic feet due to maintenance related capacity constraints on consol energy s transportation capacity on the columbia interstate pipeline 
as a result of increased demand for pipeline use on the columbia interstate pipeline  and the potential for curtailment on portions of the shipment capacity allocated to consol energy  we purchased firm transportation capacity on the pipeline during this arrangement offset a portion of the expected impact from periodic curtailments 
in april  we were given notice by columbia regarding reductions in allowable gas flow due to routine maintenance and construction activities 
interruptible gas was completely shut in and our contracted firm transportation flows were reduced by which resulted in reduced revenues of million along with other smaller curtailments throughout the year that were also eventually lifted 
variance percentage change gas royalty interest sales volumes in billion cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet included in royalty interest gas sales are the revenues related to the portion of production associated with royalty interest owners 
the increase in sales price is a function of the average gas price before the effects of financial swap transactions being higher in the current year than in the prior year

in accordance with emerging issues task force  we have increased our revenues and our costs 
sales of purchased gas volumes have increased primarily due to consol energy utilizing higher levels of firm transportation throughout the period that required us to purchase from and sell to other counterparties 
consol energy began to enter into this type of transaction in may of the million increase in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was primarily due to increased sales volumes 
the million increase in other sales was attributable to revenues from river barge towing 
under the jones act bowater exemption  because consol energy was more than owned by a foreign company  we were prohibited from providing river barge towing to third parties 
consol energy began third party river barge towing shortly after rwe ag divested their ownership interest in the period as we were no longer restricted by the jones act 
freight revenue is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation ie  rail  barge  truck  etc 
used for the customers to which consol energy contractually provides transportation services 
freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred 
on june   the board of directors of consol energy authorized the incorporation of cnx gas corporation cnx gas 
on june  cnx gas was incorporated and issued shares of its par value common stock to consolidation coal company  a wholly owned subsidiary of consol energy 
cnx gas was incorporated to conduct consol energy s gas exploration and production activities 
in august  consol energy contributed or leased substantially all of the assets of its gas business  including all of consol energy s rights to coalbed methane associated with billion tons of coal reserves owned or controlled by consol energy as well as all of consol energy s rights to conventional gas 
in exchange for consol energy s contribution of assets  consol energy received approximately million shares of cnx gas common stock 
cnx gas entered into various agreements with consol energy that define various operating and service relationships between the two companies 
in august  cnx gas entered into an agreement to sell approximately million shares in a private transaction and granted a day option to purchase an additional million shares 
in august  cnx gas closed on the sale of all million shares 
the shares were sold to qualified institutional  foreign and accredited investors in a private transaction exempt from registration under rule a  regulation s and regulation d 
in august  a registration statement on form s was filed with the sec with respect to those shares 
the registration statement was declared effective on january  the proceeds approximately million including proceeds from the sale of the additional million shares were used to pay a special dividend to consol energy

buchanan mine experienced a fire that developed in the mine after a large rock fall behind our longwall mining section on february  the mine was temporarily sealed in order to extinguish the fire 
coal production resumed on june  consol energy filed an insurance claim for reimbursement of various costs and business interruption related to the fire at buchanan mine 
during the three months ended december   consol energy received an advance on the filed claim from the insurance companies 
the portion of the advance related to fire abatement and various related costs relieved the previously established receivable 
the portion related to business interruption was recognized as other income in the period received 
the decrease in gain on sale of assets in the period reflects consol energy s sale of stock in our wholly owned subsidiary cnx australia pty limited to certain affiliates of amci  inc for million  the assumption of approximately million of debt  and associated interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges in the period 
the sale resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
the additional gain on sale of assets in the period is primarily related to the sale of several previously closed operations 
the period gain on sale of assets is primarily related to the sale of several previously closed operations 
interest income increased in the period to period comparison due to our improved cash position 
cash and cash equivalent balances at december  were million compared to million at december  the improved cash position was primarily due to the august sale of interest in cnx gas stock 
the private sale of this stock resulted in million of proceeds 
other income from the harmar environmental trust the trust settlement was attributable to the civil division of the court of common pleas of allegheny county s decision to terminate a trust among consol energy and other parties 
the trust was established in to provide funding for water treatment related to the now closed harmar mine 
other parties funded the trust 
consol energy was responsible to complete water treatment activities  but all costs associated with these activities were funded by the trust agreement 
any excess funding upon completion of water treatment or a specified date in the future was to be distributed to parties that originally funded the trust 
in the decision  all previously funded  but unused  amounts remaining in the trust were distributed 
consol energy s portion of the distributed funds was million 
consol energy is responsible for the ongoing water treatment at this facility 
consol energy recorded the funds and the present value of the water treatment liability resulting in million of income in the period 
the equity income of affiliates in the period is attributable to consol energy s portion of a gain on sale of land by an affiliate 
the equity losses of affiliates in the period is due mainly to the equity losses related to glennies creek mine operating results prior to the sale that occurred in february

costs dollar variance percentage change cost of good sold and other charges produced coal purchased coal produced gas gas royalty interest purchased gas industrial supplies closed and idle mines other total cost of goods sold increased cost of goods sold and other charges for company produced coal was due mainly to an increase in cost per ton of produced coal sold and a increase in sales volumes 
variance percentage change produced tons sold in millions average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton average cost of goods sold and other charges for produced coal increased due mainly to increased unit costs 
this increase is attributable to higher supply costs  higher labor costs  higher contract mining fee costs and higher other post employment benefits per unit sold 
higher supply costs were attributable to increased maintenance costs and increased costs for steel  petroleum products and chemicals  such as magnetite  used in the mining and coal preparation process 
higher supply costs were also related to certain locations being in difficult mining conditions which increase costs on a per unit of output basis 
increased labor costs were attributable to increased employee counts and increased wages at certain mining operations 
mancounts have been increased in certain locations to maintain development rates ahead of the longwall mining units 
labor rates were increased in order to stay competitive in certain labor markets 
increased contract mining fees were attributable to increased fees negotiated with the contractors used primarily in our central appalachian operations 
increased other post employment benefits were primarily due to the impact of cost increases for medical and drug benefits 
increased produced coal costs of goods sold was also due to higher sales volumes in the period compared to the period 
these increases in costs were offset  in part  by reduced combined fund premiums related to a premium differential that was paid in the period 
due to the recent insured losses at our mines  property and business interruption insurance coverage may be difficult to renew at the current pricing levels and terms 
purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges increased in the period to period comparison 
variance percentage change purchased tons sold in millions average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton the higher average cost of purchased coal is primarily due to overall increases in prices for domestic coals  offset by reduced volumes of purchased coal sold 

table of contents produced gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased due primarily to increased unit costs 
variance percentage change produced gas sales volumes in billion gross cubic feet average cost per thousand cubic feet the increase in average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold was primarily attributable to increased royalty expense  offset  in part by changes in imbalance amounts 
the average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold increased due to a increase per thousand cubic feet of gas sold related to the purchase of firm transportation capacity on the columbia interstate pipeline because of potential curtailments on portions of shipment capacity allocated to consol energy as a result of increased demand for pipeline access in the period 
cost per unit increased per thousand cubic feet of gas sold due to higher well maintenance fees 
these fees have increased due to more wells being serviced in the increase in average unit costs was also due to an increase of approximately per thousand cubic feet in the period to period comparison due to changes in the gas imbalance amounts 
because contracted quantities of gas delivered to the pipeline rarely equal physical deliveries to customers  consol energy is responsible for monitoring this imbalance and requesting adjustments to contracted volumes as circumstances warrant 
the increase in imbalance cost per unit sold was offset by corresponding increases in gas sales revenue 
in addition  unit costs increased per thousand cubic feet due to additional power expense as a result of converting several compressors from gas powered to electric powered in the period 
an increase of per thousand cubic feet was attributable to various costs which were incurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
variance percentage change gas royalty interest sales volumes in billion cubic feet average cost per thousand cubic feet included in royalty interest gas costs are the expenses related to the portion of production associated with royalty interest owners 
the increase in sales price is a function of the average gas price  before the effects of financial swap transactions  being higher in the current year than in the prior year

purchased gas information is as follows variance percentage change purchased gas sales volumes in billion gross cubic feet average cost per thousand cubic feet in connection with the purchase of firm transportation capacity on the columbia pipeline  we purchased from and sold to other gas suppliers  which increased our revenues and our costs 
consol energy believes this type of transaction may continue as a result of increased capacity demands on the columbia pipeline 
the period included a smaller volume of firm transportation activity as we did not begin to purchase this capacity until may of industrial supplies cost of goods sold have increased million primarily due to higher sales volumes 
closed and idle mine cost of goods sold was million lower in the period compared to the period primarily due to lower workers compensation expense 
workers compensation expense related to closed and idled locations has decreased million primarily due to the actuarial effects of several law changes in the state of west virginia related to workers compensation 
lower expense was also due to emery being active for 
table of contents all of the period compared to being idled for most of the period 
other reductions in closed and idle mine cost of goods sold were due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
these improvements were offset  in part  by higher expenses related to mine closing  perpetual care water treatment and reclamation liability adjustments that were a result of updated engineering surveys 
survey adjustments resulted in million of additional expense in the period for closed and idled locations compared to the results of the survey adjustments in the period 
miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to the following items dollar variance percentage change incentive compensation buchanan mine fire buchanan skip hoist accident sales contract buy outs bank fees litigation settlements and contingencies coal property holding costs stock based compensation expense accounts receivable securitization fees other post employee benefit curtailment gain buckeye landfill superfund site liability transfer miscellaneous transactions total miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges incentive compensation expense increased due to an increase in the projected amount expected to be paid out to employees for the period compared to the period 
the incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when consol energy reaches predetermined earnings targets and the employees reach predetermined performance targets 
consol energy s buchanan mine  located near keen mountain  virginia  experienced a large rock fall behind our longwall mining section on february  while caving behind the longwall is a normal part of the mining process  the size of this cave in created a large air pressure wave that disrupted ventilation and also caused an ignition of methane gas in the area 
consol energy temporarily sealed the mine in order to extinguish the fire that developed after the ignition 
various materials  including nitrogen foam and water were pumped into the mine in order to accelerate the process of creating an inert environment within the mine to extinguish the fire 
coal production resumed on june  costs of goods sold incurred  net of expected insurance recovery  for the year ended december  were million 
the buchanan mine was idled on september  following a problem with the mine s skip hoist mechanism 
repairs to the skip hoist shaft and structures were completed and the mine resumed production on december  expenses of approximately million related to the damaged area were incurred during this time frame 
also  approximately million were capitalized related to the installation and replacement of equipment and facilities damaged in the accident 
we filed property damage and business interruption claims related to this incident 
as of december   no insurance receivables have been recognized for these claims

bank fees remained consistent in the period to period comparison 

table of contents litigation settlements and contingencies increased in the period compared to the period 
the increase is attributable to a proposed settlement agreement with certain lessors in western kentucky which would require the transfer of certain properties and permits  as well as a cash payment to the lessors  with the lessors assuming all reclamation liability for the mine property which is being transferred 
various other contingencies were incurred in both periods  none of which were individually material 
coal property holding costs increased in the period primarily due to leasehold surrenders that occurred in in april  consol energy began to issue restricted stock units as part of its equity incentive plan 
compensation cost for the restricted stock units is based upon the closing share price at the date of grant and is recognized over the vesting period of the units 
the increase in stock based compensation expense in the period is due to compensation cost for the grants being recognized for the full period as well as additional compensation costs for restricted stock unit grants that occurred in the period 
accounts receivable securitization fees remained consistent in the period to period comparison 
due to the restructuring that occurred in december  a curtailment gain related to the other post employment benefit plan of approximately million was recognized in the period 
due to consol energy s measurement date being september  the gain was not able to be recognized in the financial statements until the quarter ended march  in april  consol energy entered into an environmental liability transfer and indemnity agreement that transferred our liability related to the buckeye landfill superfund site to another party 
in  consol energy was named a potentially responsible party related to the buckeye landfill superfund site and accordingly recognized an estimated liability for remediation of this site 
the transfer and indemnity transaction resulted in the reversal of the remaining liability and the recognition of approximately million of income

table of contents depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased due to the following items dollar variance percentage change coal gas production gathering total gas other total depreciation  depletion and amortization the decrease in coal depreciation  depletion and amortization was primarily attributable to the acceleration of approximately million of depreciation for equipment and facilities at rend lake and other idle mines in the period 
consol energy s management reviewed the assets at these idled locations in conjunction with changes in mine plans for these locations 
no plan of use for these items was determined 
these pieces of equipment and facilities were considered abandoned and estimated useful lives were adjusted accordingly 
rend lake and the other idled locations have existing coal reserves that may be accessed through new facilities or from other active locations 
this decrease was offset  in part  by additional equipment being placed in service at active locations  such as mcelroy mine  bailey mine and enlow mine  after the period 
increases were also attributable to expansion projects  such as mcelroy and bailey refuse area and plant expansion  that were completed and in service in the period 
the increase in gas production depreciation  depletion and amortization was primarily due to higher unit of production rates in the period compared to the period

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective january   consol energy changed our method of accounting for workers compensation 
prior to the change  consol energy recorded our workers compensation liability on an undiscounted basis 
under the new method  consol energy recorded our liability on a discounted actuarial basis  using various 
table of contents assumptions  including discount rate and future cost trends 
we believe this actuarial approach is more explicit in its methodology  which should lead to better estimates of the liability and related periodic costs 
the change is also preferable because it aligns the accounting with our other long term employee benefit obligations  which are recorded on a discounted basis 
additionally  it provides a better comparison with our industry peers  the majority of which record the workers compensation liability on a discounted basis 
as a result of the change  consol energy reduced our workers compensation liability by million and reduced the related deferred tax asset by million 
the cumulative effect adjustment recognized upon adoption was a gain of million  net of a tax cost of approximately million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period 
note of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters 
management believes that the estimates utilized are reasonable 
the following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
other post employment benefits consol energy has historically provided retiree health benefits to employees that retire with at least ten years of service and have attained age effective august   the eligibility requirement for salaried employees was changed to either twenty years of service and age  or fifteen years of service and age additionally  any salaried or non represented hourly employees that are hired or rehired effective august  or later will not become eligible for retiree health benefits 
in lieu of traditional retiree health coverage  if certain eligibility requirements are met  these employees may be eligible to receive a retiree medical spending allowance of  per year of service at retirement 
eligibility requirements for represented hourly employees at december  have not changed from consol energy s historical requirements 
newly employed inexperienced employees represented by the umwa  hired after january  will not be eligible to receive retiree benefits 
in lieu of these benefits  these employees will receive a defined contribution benefit of per each hour worked 
at december   the retiree health plan provided benefits to approximately  of our former employees and their eligible dependents 
the medical plan which covers eligible salaried employees and retirees also includes a cost sharing structure where essentially all participants contribute of plan costs 
annual cost increases for the salary plan in excess of are paid entirely by the salaried participants 
after our review  various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  expected trend in health care costs  average remaining service period  average remaining life expectancy and per capita costs  are used by our independent actuary to estimate the cost and benefit obligations for our retiree health plans 
effective december   a persistency assumption was introduced into the salaried retiree medical plan liability valuation 
this assumption estimates the overall participation level in the plan in each future year 
due to the salaried plan s cost sharing and trend capping design features  it is assumed that the overall level of plan participation will gradually drop to of the current levels by assumptions used in have not differed materially from the prior year actual experience 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date currently september 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the other post employment benefit liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  consol energy looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
for the year ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was and  respectively 
a increase in the discount rate would have decreased net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately million 
a decrease in the discount rate would have 
table of contents increased net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately million 
deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and medical cost inflation differing from expectations in prior years 
changes to interest rates for the rates of returns on instruments that could be used to settle the actuarially determined plan obligations introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future service of active salary employees to their assumed retirement age 
the average remaining service period for our salaried plans is approximately years for the year ended december  accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected remaining life of our retired united mine workers of america umwa population 
the average remaining service period of this population is not used for amortization purposes because the majority of the umwa population of our plan is retired 
the average remaining life expectancy of our retired umwa population used to calculate the following year s expense is approximately years for the year ended december  per capita costs on a per annum basis for other postretirement benefits were assumed to be  at december  this was approximately a increase over the per capita cost on a per annum basis at december  after adjusting for demographic shifts 
the increase was due to healthcare cost trends and demographic shifts in participants 
if the actual increase in per capita cost of medical services or other post retirement benefits are significantly greater or less than the projected trend rates  the per capita cost assumption would need to be adjusted annually  which could have a significant effect on the costs and liabilities recognized in the financial statements 
significant increases in health and prescription drug costs for represented hourly retirees could have a material adverse effect on consol energy s operating cash flow 
the effect on consol energy s cash flow from operations for salaried and non represented hourly employees has been limited to approximately of the previous year s medical cost for salaried employees due to the cost sharing provision in the benefit plan 
on september  statement of financial accounting standard no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas was issued 
sfas requires  among other things  the recognition of the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan and other postretirement benefit plan on the balance sheet 
each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each underfunded plan is recognized as a liability 
the initial impact of the standard  as well as subsequent changes  in the funded status of the plans is recognized as a component of accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are no longer recognized upon adoption of the new standard 
additionally  sfas requires an employer to measure the funded status of its plans as of the date of its year end statement of financial position 
this provision becomes effective for consol energy for its december  year end 
currently  consol energy uses a september measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the estimated liability recognized in the december  financial statements after the impact of sfas was billion 
the recognition of sfas resulted in an increase of million to the other post employment liability  an increase in our deferred tax asset of approximately million and a decrease to other comprehensive income of million 
for the year ended december  we paid approximately million for other post employment benefits  all of which were paid from operating cash flow 
our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at december  consol energy does not expect to contribute to the other post employment plan in we intend to pay benefit claims as they are due 
consol energy recognized the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act medicare part d of the act in the year ended december  in accordance with fasb staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of in december  consol energy amended its election of the federal subsidy provision of the act 
instead  we will coordinate benefits with available medicare coverage considered the primary payer so that consol energy s plan pays secondary to medicare 
the plan amendment resulted in a net reduction of million in the accumulated projected benefit obligation apbo and is reflected as a plan amendment and as an actuarial gain loss 
in  there was an additional 
table of contents plan amendment related to medicare part d which specified that consol energy would pay the related premiums for certain participants 
this amendment increased the apbo by million 
these adjustments will be amortized to earnings over approximately years 
salaried pensions consol energy has non contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all employees not covered by multi employer plans 
the benefits for these plans are based primarily on years of service and employee s pay near retirement 
effective january   employees hired between august  and december  that were not previously eligible to participate in the plans will begin accruing service 
the consol energy salaried plan allows for lump sum distributions earned up until december  at the employees election 
as of january   lump sum benefits have been frozen and the lump sum option has been eliminated for benefits accrued prospectively 
effective january   employees hired by cnx gas  an owned subsidiary  will not be eligible to participate in cnx gas non contributory defined benefit retirement plan 
in lieu of participation in the non contributory defined benefit plan  these employees will begin receiving an additional company contribution into their defined contribution plan 
cnx gas employees who were hired prior to december  or who were employees of consol energy prior to this date were given a one time opportunity to elect to remain in the defined benefit plan or opt to freeze their service accruals and participate in the additional company contribution into their defined contribution plan 
all employees hired on or after january  but on or before december  will have their current non contributory defined benefit frozen and will begin receiving the additional company contribution into their defined contribution plan  effective january  cnx gas intends to freeze all defined benefit accruals after ten years for cnx gas employees that elected to remain in the defined benefit plan 
our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated retirement obligation based on assumptions including rates of compensation  mortality rates  retirement age and interest rates 
these assumptions have not differed materially from the prior year actual experience 
for the years ended december  and  compensation increases are assumed to range from to depending on age and job classification 
retirement rate assumptions were unchanged for the year ended december  retirement rate assumptions begin at for employees at age and increase to for employees at age the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date currently september 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the retirement plans could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  consol energy looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
for the years ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was and  respectively 
a increase in the discount rate would have decreased the net periodic pension cost by million 
a decrease in the discount rate would have increased the net periodic pension cost by million 
deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and earnings on assets differing from expectations in prior years 
the average remaining service period is approximately years for the year ended december  changes to any of these assumptions introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
the estimated liability at december  after the implementation of sfas was million 
the recognition of sfas resulted in an increase of million in our salary retirement plan liability  an increase in our deferred tax assets of million and a decrease to other comprehensive income of million 
consol energy expects to contribute approximately million to the pension plan in the market related asset value is derived by taking the cost value of assets as of september  and multiplying it by the average month ratio of the market value of assets to the cost value of assets 
consol energy s pension plan weighted average asset allocations at september  consisted of equity securities and debt securities 

table of contents the consol energy salaried plan allows for lump sum distributions earned up until december  at the employees election 
as of january   lump sum benefits have been frozen and prospectively the lump sum option has been eliminated 
according to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  if the lump sum distributions made for the plan year  which is october to september  exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year  settlement accounting is required 
lump sum payments exceeded this threshold during consol energy recognized expense of million in the current year s results of operations 
the adjustment equaled the previously unrecognized actuarial loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year 
consol regularly monitors this situation 
if this settlement accounting is triggered again in the future  the adjustment could materially impact operating results 
workers compensation and coal workers pneumoconiosis workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain employment related physical injuries or some type of occupational diseases are compensated for their disabilities  medical costs  and on some occasions  for the costs of their rehabilitation 
workers compensation will also compensate the survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths 
the workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee that is injured in the course of employment 
consol energy records an actuarially calculated liability  which is determined using various assumptions  including discount rate and future cost trends 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date currently september 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the workers compensation liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  consol energy looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
for the year ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was and  respectively 
a increase or decrease in the discount rate would not have materially decreased or increased the workers compensation expense 
the estimated liability after the impact of sfas recognized in the financial statements at december   was approximately million 
the recognition of sfas resulted in a decrease of million in our workers compensation liability  a decrease in our deferred tax asset of million and an increase in other comprehensive income of million 
consol energy s policy has been to provide for workers compensation benefits from operating cash flow 
no funding has been provided to cover these benefits 
for the year ended december   we made payments for workers compensation benefits of approximately million  all of which was paid from operating cash flow 
consol energy is responsible under the federal coal mine health and safety act of  as amended  for medical and disability benefits to employees and their dependents resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease 
consol energy is also responsible under various state statutes for pneumoconiosis benefits 
after our review  our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis obligation based on assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs  mortality  death benefits  dependents and discount rates 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date currently september 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the coal workers pneumoconiosis liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  consol energy looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
for the year ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was and  respectively 
in january  the united states department of labor amended the regulations implementing the federal black lung laws to give greater weight to the opinion of a claimant s treating physician  expand the definition of black lung disease and limit the amount of medical evidence that can be submitted by claimants and respondents 
the amendments also alter administrative procedures for the adjudication of claims  which according to the department of labor  results in streamlined procedures that are less formal  less adversarial and easier for participants to understand 
the estimated liability recognized in the financial 
table of contents statements at december  after the implementation of sfas was approximately million 
the recognition of sfas resulted in a decrease of million in our coal workers pneumoconiosis liability  a decrease of approximately million in our deferred tax asset and an increase to other comprehensive income of million 
for the year ended december   we paid coal workers pneumoconiosis benefits of approximately million 
our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at december  reclamation and mine closure obligations the surface mining control and reclamation act establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
consol energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine and gas well closure  including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary 
estimates of our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities  which are based upon permit requirements and consol energy engineering expertise related to these requirements  including the current portion  were approximately million at december  this liability is reviewed annually by consol energy management and engineers 
the estimated liability can significantly change if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and gas wells and the reclamation of land upon exhaustion of coal and gas reserves 
changes in the variables used to calculate the liabilities can have a significant effect on the mine closing  reclamation and gas well closing liabilities 
the amounts of assets and liabilities recorded are dependent upon a number of variables  including the estimated future retirement costs  estimated proven reserves  assumptions involving profit margins  inflation rates  and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
sfas no 
requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time 
the depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis  whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets  typically as production declines 
deferred taxes consol energy accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
all available evidence both positive and negative  must be considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
at december   consol energy has deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately million 
the deferred tax assets are evaluated periodically to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary 
during consol energy concluded that a valuation allowance was no longer warranted against a portion of its state net operating loss carry forwards in certain tax jurisdictions 
in consol energy will implement certain prudent and feasible tax strategies to insure the realization of pennsylvania loss carry forward tax benefits 
the value of consol energy s net operating loss carry forwards increased significantly in as a result of a change in the pennsylvania statute which increased the annual limitation on the deduction for net operating losses to be applied against future taxable income from million to the greater of million or of taxable income for tax years beginning after consol energy s valuation allowance attributable to its operating loss carry forwards in west virginia was also released during consol energy reported a 
table of contents cumulative tax loss for west virginia tax purposes for the three year period that includes december  through december  due to non recurring tax return adjustments in and relating to adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  non taxable opeb subsidy accruals  and the refund of reclamation proceeds 
absent the non recurring tax adjustments consol energy would have reported cumulative taxable income on its west virginia tax returns for the three year period 
based on the analysis of prior years tax filings and projections of west virginia taxable income for and future years  management believes that the benefits of the state operating loss carry forwards will be realized 
as a result of the reduction of the valuation allowance relating to pennsylvania and west virginia operating loss carry forwards  consol energy reported a state income tax benefit in of  on an after federal tax adjusted basis 
for  consol energy continues to report a deferred tax asset of approximately million relating to the remainder of consol energy s state net operating loss carry forwards with a full valuation allowance 
a review of the positive and negative evidence regarding these benefits  primarily the history of book and tax losses on a separate company basis  concluded that a valuation allowance was warranted 
a valuation allowance of million has also been recorded against the deferred state tax asset attributable to future deductible differences for certain subsidiaries with histories of book and tax losses 
these net operating losses expire at various times from to management will continue to assess the realization of deferred tax assets based upon updated income forecast data and the feasibility of future tax planning strategies  and may record adjustments to valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in future periods as appropriate that could materially impact net income 
stock options prior to january   consol energy accounted for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as amended 
generally no stock based employee compensation cost for stock options is reflected in net income  as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant 
on january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payments sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas no 
eliminates the option of using the intrinsic value method of accounting previously available under apb no 
 and requires companies to recognize in the financial statements the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
consol energy recorded million of expense  net of tax  as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
we anticipate the future impact of sfas r to approximate current year expense 
the black scholes option pricing model is used to determine fair value of stock options at the grant date 
various inputs are utilized in the black scholes pricing model  such as stock price on measurement date  exercise price defined in the award  expected dividend yield based on historical trend of dividend payouts  risk free interest rate based on a zero coupon treasury bond rate  expected term based on historical grant and exercise behavior  and expected volatility based on historic and implied stock price volatility of consol energy stock and public peer group stock 
these factors can significantly impact the value of stock options expense recognized over the requisite service period of option holders 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for more information 

table of contents contingencies consol energy is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the outcome of these proceedings 
successful efforts accounting we are required to select among alternative acceptable accounting policies 
there are two generally acceptable methods for accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
the full cost method allows the capitalization of all costs associated with exploring for  acquiring and developing oil and natural gas reserves 
the successful efforts method allows only for the capitalization of costs directly associated with exploring for  acquiring and developing proven natural gas properties 
costs related to exploration that are not successful are expensed when it is determined that commercially productive gas reserves were not found 
we have elected to use the successful efforts method to account for our gas producing activities 
coal and gas reserve values there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff 
our gas reserves have been reviewed by independent experts 
approximately of our reported reserves have been reviewed and confirmed by an independent third party consultant 
some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal and gas attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
see risk factors in item a of this report for a discussion of the uncertainties in estimating our reserves 
liquidity and capital resources consol energy generally has satisfied our working capital requirements and funded our capital expenditures and debt service obligations from cash generated from operations and proceeds from borrowings 
we utilize a million revolving credit facility which expires in the facility is collateralized by liens on substantially all of the assets of consol energy and our wholly owned subsidiaries 
collateral is shared equally and ratably with the holders of consol energy s bonds that mature in and consol energy s subsidiary s medium term notes maturing in fees and interest rate spreads are based on a ratio of financial covenant debt to twelve month trailing earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
covenants in the facility limit our ability to dispose of assets  make investments  
table of contents purchase or redeem consol energy common stock and merge with another corporation 
the facility includes a leverage ratio covenant of not more than to  measured quarterly 
this ratio was to at december  the facility also includes an interest coverage ratio covenant of no less than to  measured quarterly 
this ratio was to at december  at december   this facility had approximately million letters of credit issued and had no outstanding borrowings  leaving approximately million of unused capacity 
we have been notified that approximately million of financial security  currently provided through issuance of letters of credit  will be no longer required by the fund 
the reduction of security is due to the legislative change that the surface mining control and reclamation act amendments of provides 
the new legislation requires certain annual transfers to be made from the abandoned mine land aml program to the combined fund  fund and the fund 
the current law was amended so that after a phase in period  the new legislation removes the annual cap on the amount of interest to be transferred and requires annual transfers of aml fund interest to the combined benefit fund  fund and fund to pay the health care benefits of retirees whose employers have gone out of business 
previous to the legislative change  benefits of retirees whose employers have gone out of business have been paid by the surviving companies participating in the funds 
because this funding requirement will be eliminated after the phase in period  security required by the funds has been reduced 
on october   cnx gas  an controlled and consolidated subsidiary of consol energy  entered into a credit agreement with a group of commercial lenders 
the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility providing an initial aggregate outstanding principal amount of up to million  including borrowings and letters of credit 
cnx gas also has the ability to request an increase in aggregate outstanding principal amount of up to million  including borrowings and letters of credit 
this facility includes a leverage ratio covenant of not more than to  measured quarterly 
this ratio was to at december  the facility also includes an interest coverage ratio covenant of no less than to  measured quarterly 
this ratio was met at december  at december   this facility had approximately million letters of credit issued and had no outstanding borrowings  leaving approximately million of unused capacity 
as a result of entering into the new credit agreement  cnx gas and their subsidiaries executed a supplemental indenture and as of october  are also guarantors of consol energy s bonds 
consol energy and certain of our us subsidiaries also participate in a receivables securitization facility for the sale on a continuous basis of eligible trade accounts receivable that will provide  on a revolving basis  up to million of short term funding 
consol energy formed cnx funding corporation  a wholly owned  special purpose  bankruptcy remote subsidiary  for the sole purpose of buying and selling eligible trade receivables generated by certain subsidiaries of consol energy 
under the receivables facility  consol energy and certain subsidiaries  irrevocably and without recourse  sell all of their eligible trade accounts receivable to cnx funding corporation 
cnx funding corporation then sells  on a revolving basis  an undivided percentage interest in the pool of eligible trade accounts receivable to financial institutions and their affiliates  while maintaining a subordinated interest in a portion of the trade receivables 
consol energy has agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions for a fee based upon market rates for similar services 
the cost of funds is consistent with commercial paper rates plus a charge for administrative services paid to the financial institution 
the receivables facility expires in april  although consol energy intends to renew the facility 
no accounts receivable were removed from the consolidated balance sheet related to this facility during the year ended december  as all eligible accounts receivables have been retained 
consol energy believes that cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures other than major acquisitions  scheduled debt payments  anticipated dividend payments and to provide required letters of credit 
nevertheless  the ability of consol energy to satisfy our working capital requirements  debt service obligations  to fund 
table of contents planned capital expenditures or pay dividends will depend upon future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal and gas industries and other financial and business factors  some of which are beyond consol energy s control 
in order to manage the market risk exposure of volatile natural gas prices in the future  consol energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with both gas marketers and end users for terms varying in length 
consol energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges  which exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
the fair value of these contracts was a gain of million net of million of deferred tax at december  the ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of these contracts was insignificant to earnings in the years ended december  and consol energy frequently evaluates potential acquisitions 
consol energy has funded acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations and a variety of other sources  depending on the size of the transaction  including debt financing 
there can be no assurance that additional capital resources  including debt financing  will be available to consol energy on terms which consol energy finds acceptable  or at all 
cash flows in millions change cash flows from operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in financing activities cash flows from operating activities have increased primarily due to the following items operating cash flows improved million due to increases in earnings excluding the gain on sale of of cnx gas  as previously discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
operating cash flows were lower in the period due to million repaid under the accounts receivable securitization program during the year ended december  the accounts receivable securitization program had no activity during the year ended december  operating cash flows were higher by approximately million due to coal inventories 
coal inventories decreased million tons in the year ended december  compared to an increase of million tons in the year ended december  operating cash flows also fluctuated due to various changes in operating assets  operating liabilities  other assets and other liabilities which occurred throughout both periods 
net cash used in investing activities changed primarily due to the following items during  proceeds of million were received from the sale of of cnx gas  a subsidiary of consol energy  when million shares were sold in a private transaction 
cnx gas received proceeds of million  which it used to pay a special dividend to consol energy 
capital expenditures were million in the period compared to million in the period 
capital expenditures were higher in primarily due to work being completed on the slope  overland belt and new preparation plant at our robinson run mine  our enhanced gas well drilling program and various other projects being completed 
in january  consol energy  completed the acquisition of mon river towing and jar barge lines  llc  from the guttman group for a cash payment of approximately million  as discussed previously 
in november  consol energy  invested million for a interest in a specialty contracting company 

table of contents proceeds from the sale of assets were million in the period compared to million in the period 
proceeds in the period are primarily related to the sale and subsequent lease back of longwall mining equipment 
the lease has been reported as a capital lease  and accordingly a liability for the present value of the lease payments has been recognized 
proceeds in the period are related to the sale and subsequent lease back of the corporate office building 
both periods also include proceeds related to the sale of various properties held by consol energy 
net cash used in financing activities changed primarily due to the following items in the period  approximately million of consol energy stock was repurchased under the share repurchase program that was approved in december as of december   we have repurchased  shares at an average price of under this program 
million of stock was issued in the year ended december  compared to million issued in the year ended december  stock issuances in both periods were a result of stock option exercises

b long term liabilities include other post employment benefits  work related injuries and illnesses  defined benefit pension plans  mine reclamation and closure  and other long term liability costs 
as discussed in critical accounting policies and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  our determination of these long term liabilities is calculated annually and is based on several assumptions  including then prevailing conditions  which may change from the amounts included in the table  and may change significantly  if our assumptions change to reflect changing conditions 

table of contents capital expenditures were approximately million  excluding million expended to acquire mon river towing and jar barge lines  llc  in the year december  compared to million in the year ended december  we currently anticipate capital expenditures for the year ending december  to be approximately million  of which approximately million is to maintain current coal production levels 
there is also million included in the total related to the gas well drilling program 
we may choose to defer certain capital projects in light of operating results  market conditions or the availability of financing 
capital expenditures for pollution abatement and reclamation are projected to be million for the year ending december  our capital expenditures have been and will be primarily used for replacement of mining and gas equipment  the expansion of mining and gas capacity and projects to improve the efficiency of the mining and gas operations 
the projected capital expenditures for are not committed and are expected to be funded with cash generated by operations and existing borrowing capacity 
in addition  cash requirements to fund employee related  mine closure and other long term liabilities included above  along with obligations related to long term debt  capital and operating leases  are expected to be funded with cash generated by operations and existing borrowing capacity

stockholders equity and dividends consol energy had stockholders equity of  million at december  and  million at december  the increase is primarily attributable to million of net income 
the increase in stockholders equity was offset  in part  by the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  sfas in december this statement required the recognition of the underfund overfunded status of our long term

the recognition of sfas resulted in a reduction of stockholders equity  net of tax  of million 
stockholders equity was also impacted by the repurchases of shares under the consol energy share repurchase program and the payment of dividends during the year 
these decreases in stockholders equity were offset  in part  by changes in cash flow hedges  the two benefits associated with stock based compensation awards and net income of million for the year ended december  consol energy began a share repurchase program of up to million of the company s common stock during a month period beginning january  and ending december  as of december   we have repurchased  shares at an average price of under this program

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas aims to improve the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements by creating a single definition of fair value 
the statement emphasizes that fair value is not entity specific  but instead is a market based measurement of an asset or liability 
sfas upholds the requirements of previously issued pronouncements concerning fair value measurements and expands the required disclosures 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   however earlier application is permitted provided the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year 
we do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on consol energy 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas  which requires the recognition of the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans and related disclosures 
sfas was issued to address concerns that prior standards on employers accounting for defined benefit postretirement plans failed to communicate the funded status of those plans in a complete and understandable way and to require an employer to recognize completely in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income the financial impact of certain events affecting the plan s funded status when those events occurred 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after december  retrospective application of this statement is not permitted 
the financial impact of this statement decreased accumulated other comprehensive income by million  increased long term liabilities by million  and increased long term assets by million as of december  additionally  sfas requires an employer to measure the funded status of each of its plans as of the date of its year end statement of financial position 
this provision becomes effective for consol energy for its december  year end
