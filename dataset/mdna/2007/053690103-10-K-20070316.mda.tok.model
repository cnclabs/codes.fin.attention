item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview for a description of our assignment of rights to genzyme corporation  resulting in the generation of million of revenue 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
avigen s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed herein and in item a risk factors 
overview avigen is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing small molecule therapeutics and biologics to treat serious neurological and neuromuscular disorders 
our current lead product candidates primarily address spasticity and neuromuscular spasm and neuropathic pain 
our goal is to retain rights to commercialize our products in north america and therefore we expect  when appropriate  to build a sales and marketing infrastructure 
we intend to seek to out license rights to develop and market our products outside the united states 
we also intend to continue to look for opportunities to expand our pipeline of compounds through a combination of internal research  acquisitions  and in licensing as appropriate 
in january  we acquired exclusive license rights to develop and commercialize proprietary formulations of the compound tolperisone  which we have named av  for the north american market 
these rights include relevant patent filings  as well as clinical data held by sdi diagnostics international ltd  a division of sanochemia pharmazeutika ag  or sanochemia  relating to av under the terms of the agreement  we made an upfront payment of million and are required to make additional payments to sanochemia based on the parties achievement of clinical and regulatory product development milestones  and following regulatory approval  the sales of av in may  we completed a private placement of common stock with institutional investors for gross proceeds of million 
under the terms of the transaction avigen sold approximately million shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share 
the transaction did not include any warrants or other enhancements 
during the second half of  we initiated multiple clinical trials in the us and australia for compounds within our development portfolio 
this led to an increase in operating expenses during the period 
our product development plans include our intention to initiate additional clinical trials to establish efficacy as well as document additional pharmacological data that will be used to improve our design of larger future trials  as well as  if approved  to provide additional information that physicians and patients could utilize to optimize their treatment and care 
prior to  avigen focused exclusively on building a product development portfolio of dna based drug delivery technologies based primarily on adeno associated virus  or aav  vectors we developed 
our efforts included significant investment in early stage research in the field of gene therapy  which led to our filing of three separate inds and our initiation of three corresponding phase i or phase i ii clinical trials 
in  we began to pursue the development of non gene therapy products to diversify our portfolio  which is now our focus 
in december  we entered into an agreement with genzyme corporation  whereby we assigned to genzyme our rights to certain aav related intellectual property  our gene therapy clinical trial programs for parkinson s disease and hemophilia  aav related contracts  and the use of previously manufactured clinical grade vector materials 
under the terms of the agreement  we received a million payment and could receive additional development milestones  sublicensing fees and royalty payments based on the successful development of products by genzyme utilizing technologies previously developed by us 
in addition  if genzyme fails to diligently pursue the commercialization or marketing of products using the assigned technology  as specified in the agreement  certain of the rights we assigned could revert back to avigen at a future date 
from through  we were party to a collaboration agreement with bayer corporation to develop a gene therapy product for hemophilia 
in  bayer paid us million to support our development of the product candidate 
that payment was originally recorded as deferred revenue and was scheduled to be recognized ratably as revenue over the estimated five year development period associated with the product 
in may  we suspended the related clinical trial and other development activities  and accelerated the recognition of the remaining portion of deferred revenue 
we have terminated the collaboration agreement with bayer and do not expect to receive any additional payments from bayer associated with similar gene therapy activities 
we are a development stage company and have primarily supported the financial needs of our research and development activities since our inception through public offerings and private placements of our equity securities 
we have not received any revenue from the sale of our products in development  and we do not anticipate generating revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future 
as a result  we expect that we will need to obtain additional funding to support the anticipated future needs of our research and development activities  including the costs to complete clinical trials 
we expect our source of revenue  if any  for the next several years to consist of payments under collaborative arrangements with third parties  government grants  and non gene therapy related license fees 
we have incurred losses since our inception and expect to incur substantial losses over the next several years due to lack of any substantial revenue and the continuation of our ongoing and planned research and development efforts  including preclinical studies and clinical trials 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop  commercialize  manufacture  or market our product candidates or ever achieve or sustain product revenue for profitability 
at december  we had an accumulated deficit of million and cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities  and restricted investments of approximately million 
we believe that our capital resources at december   will be adequate to fund our operating needs for approximately the next two to three years 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition  valuation of investments in financial instruments  impairment of property and equipment  and recognition of research and development expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described under note in the notes to our financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the four basic criteria for revenue recognition as described in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize non refundable license or assignment fees  including development milestone payments associated with license or assignment agreements  for which we have no further significant performance obligations and no continuing involvement requirements related to product development  on the earlier of the dates on when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
for example  in  we received a million payment under the terms of our agreement with genzyme 
we recognized the payment as revenue  since we concluded that as of december   we did not have any significant future performance obligations under the agreement 
we recognize revenue associated with up front license  technology access and research and development funding payments under collaborative agreements ratably over the relevant periods specified in the agreements  generally the development phase 
this development phase can be defined as a specified period of time  however  in certain cases  the collaborative agreement specifies a development phase that culminates with milestone objectives but does not have a fixed date and requires us to estimate the time period over which to recognize this revenue 
our estimated time periods are based on management s estimate of the time required to achieve a particular development milestone considering the projected level of effort and current stage of development 
if our estimate of the development phase time period changes  the amount of revenue we recognize related to up front payments for a given period will accelerate or decrease accordingly 
for example  in march  we received a million payment from bayer under the terms of a collaboration agreement for a gene therapy product candidate for hemophilia 
the revenue associated with the payment was being recognized ratably over the development phase  which was initially estimated to be five years 
in may  we suspended subject enrollment in the phase i clinical trial for this product candidate and  as a result  ended the development phase for this product candidate and recognized as revenue million  constituting the portion of the million payment not previously recognized as revenue 
valuation of investments in financial instruments we carry investments in financial instruments at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
our investment portfolio does not include equity securities or derivative financial instruments that could subject us to material market risk  however  we do invest in corporate obligations that subject us to varying levels of credit risk 
management assesses whether declines in the fair value of investment securities are other than temporary 
if a decline in fair value of a financial instrument is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is included in earnings 
in determining whether a decline is other than temporary  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the market value of the security has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intention and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  which could be until maturity 
the determination of whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary requires significant judgment  and could have a material impact on our balance sheet and results of operations 
we have not had any write downs for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our financial instruments since our inception 
in addition  when management commits to holding individual securities until maturity in order to avoid the recognition of an other than temporary impairment  those securities would no longer be classified as available for sale 
in addition  management would evaluate these securities to determine whether the security  based on the remaining duration until its scheduled maturity  should be identified as a current or long term asset 
as of december   management had not designated any individual securities as held to maturity for the purposes of avoiding an other than temporary impairment 
impairment of property and equipment and asset retirement obligation we have invested significant amounts on construction for improvements to leased facilities we use for our research and development activities  with the largest portion of our spending made to modify manufacturing facilities that are intended to comply with requirements of government mandated manufacturing rules for pharmaceutical production 
management assesses whether the carrying value of long lived assets is impaired whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may not be fully recoverable 
we recognize an impairment loss when the total of the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying value or appraised value  as appropriate 
if we judge the value of our long lived assets to be impaired  we write down the cost basis of the property and equipment to fair value and include the amount of the write down in net loss from operations 
in determining whether the value of our property and equipment is impaired  management considers failure of manufacturing facilities and equipment to comply with government mandated policies and procedures  failure of the product candidates for which the manufacturing facilities have been constructed to receive regulatory approval  and the extent that facilities could be idled or abandoned due to a decrease in the scope of our research and development activities for an other than temporary period  resulting in excess capacity 
the determination of whether the value of our property and equipment is impaired requires significant judgment  and could have a material impact on our balance sheet and results of operations 
in  we determined that the scope of our research and development activities had changed such that we would not effectively utilize certain portions of our leased facilities that had been designed to support our gene therapy programs 
after considering alternative uses for these spaces  we decided it was not cost effective to re engineer the rooms representing approximately  square feet of manufacturing  laboratory  and office space under lease through may and approximately  square feet of similar space we have under lease through november we determined that we would maximize our potential cost savings by subleasing the properties 
based on market conditions for rental property at the time of the evaluation  and our subsequent completion of sublease agreements for approximately  square feet  we do not expect to fully recover the value invested in leasehold improvements and equipment 
therefore  we reduced our net carrying value for these assets to their current fair value at the time of the evaluation  resulting in impairment losses for the year ended december  of approximately million 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the impairment tests  we applied a hypothetical increase to the expected future cash flows underlying the fair value calculation 
this hypothetical increase still resulted in fair values that were less than the carrying values of the leasehold improvements and would have resulted in an impairment loss of million 
these impairment losses did not impact our cash flows and primarily represents an acceleration of depreciation charges that would have been recognized over the remaining three and five year lease periods 
under the terms of our building lease that expires in may  we may be required  at our landlord s sole discretion  to remove  reconfigure or otherwise alter some improvements we have made to the facility 
we determine the fair value of asset retirement obligations based on our assessment of a range of possible settlement dates and amounts 
considerable management judgment is required in estimating these obligations 
important assumptions include estimates of retirement costs  the timing of the future retirement activities  and the likelihood of retirement provisions being enforced 
changes in these assumptions based on future information could result in adjustments to estimated liabilities 
this obligation existed in prior years  but was not considered material to our financial statements 
as a result of a change in estimate in december  we remeasured the fair value of this contingent asset retirement obligation and recognized a liability for  in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations in measuring the obligation  we applied a hypothetical increase to the expected future costs underlying the fair value calculation 
this hypothetical increase would have caused a comparable increase in the retirement charge 
the recognition of this liability would have resulted in an adjustment to the carrying value of the underlying long lived assets 
however  in june  these leasehold improvements were determined to be impaired and written off with a charge to our net loss 
see note in the notes to our financial statements 
since there is no carrying value of the underlying assets at december   the recognition of our asset retirement obligation resulted in an additional charge in to impairment loss related to long lived assets 
upon settlement of the obligation  we will recognize any difference between the cost to retire the asset and the liability recorded as an increase or decrease to operating expenses in our statement of operations in the year of settlement 
recognition of research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including related salaries and benefits  facilities and other overhead costs  clinical trial and related drug product costs  contract services and other outside service expenses 
we charge research and development expenses to operating expense in the period incurred 
these expenses consist of costs incurred for our independent  as well as our collaborative  research and development activities 
pursuant to management s assessment of the services that have been performed on clinical trials and other contracts  we recognize expenses as the services are provided 
several of our contracts extend across multiple reporting periods 
management assessments include  but are not limited to  an evaluation by the project manager of the work that has been completed during the period  measurement of progress prepared internally  estimates of incurred costs by the third party service providers  and management s judgment 
the determination of the percentage of work completed that determines the amount of research and development expense that should be recognized in a given period requires significant judgment  and could have a material impact on our balance sheet and results of operations 
these estimated expenses may or may not match the actual fees billed by the service providers as determined by actual work completed 
we monitor service provider activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record significant research and development expenses in future reporting periods 
share based compensation expense effective january   we adopted fasb statement r  fas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method  and recognize share based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of share based awards in the results of our operations 
for awards that were granted but not yet vested prior to january   we calculate the share based compensation expense using the same estimate of grant date fair value previously disclosed under fas in a pro forma manner 
fair value methods require management to make several assumptions  the most significant of which are the selection of a fair value model  stock price volatility and the expected average life of an option 
we have available data of all grant by grant historical activity for stock options we have granted that we use in developing some of our assumptions 
we use the black scholes method to value stock options 
we estimate the expected average life of options granted based on historic behavior of our option holders and we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the assumptions we use in calculating the fair value of our share based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
in addition  fas r requires we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and only recognize expense for the portion of awards that are expected to vest 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate is based on historical experience of our share based awards that are granted  exercised and cancelled 
if factors change and we use different assumptions for calculating fair value of our share based awards  or if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in future periods 
results of operations revenue year ended december  in thousands  except percentages revenue   percentage decrease increase over prior period revenue in represented the  payments from our participation with the university of colorado on a grant that was funded by the national institutes of health 
revenue in primarily reflected the million payment received in connection with our december agreement with genzyme corporation 
revenues in primarily included the acceleration of deferred revenue associated with the termination of our gene therapy collaboration with bayer corporation for hemophilia 
total revenue also included research license fees of   and  during  and  respectively  and royalty revenue of   and  during  and  respectively 
these revenues were associated with research license agreements and a single royalty license related to our gene therapy technologies 
as a result of the assignment of our gene therapy assets to genzyme  we are no longer a direct party to most of the license or collaboration agreements that gave rise to the revenues prior to as a result  we do not expect any significant revenues for the foreseeable future and that such revenues  if any  will consist solely of payments that may be received in connection with other non gene therapy related activities 
research and development expenses as a result of organizational changes made in  our current operations allow us to better use external resources to optimize the pace and cost of development of our product candidates 
these changes included a reduction of our headcount and the sublease of a portion of our operating facilities in the second half of as a result  our current business model reduces our exposure to fixed costs for manufacturing staff and facilities and gives us more control over the strategic timing and application of our resources 
our research and development expenses can be divided into two primary functions  costs to support research and preclinical development and costs to support preparation for and implementation of human clinical trials 
research and preclinical development costs include activities associated with general research and exploration  animal studies  production of drug substances for use by external collaborators in general research and exploration  development of processes to translate research achievements into commercial scale capabilities  and in house and independent third party validation testing of potential acquisition or in license drug candidates 
clinical development costs include activities associated with preparing for regulatory approvals  maintaining regulated and controlled processes  manufacturing drug substances for use in human clinical trials  and supporting subject enrollment and subject administration within clinical trials 
at december   the staff count associated with our current research and development activities  which focus on our portfolio of small molecule candidates for the treatment of serious neurological and neuromuscular disorders  was  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
the costs associated with these two primary functions of our research and development activities approximate the following in thousands  except percentages percentage percentage year ended decrease year ended december  increase december  over over research and preclinical development    clinical development    total research and development expenses    because a significant percentage of our research and development resources are dedicated to activities that focus on broad methods and mechanisms that may be used in multiple product applications  including production and administration techniques  the majority of our costs are not directly attributed to individual development programs 
decisions regarding our project management and resource allocation are primarily based on interpretations of scientific data  rather than cost allocations 
our estimates of costs between research and preclinical development and clinical development are primarily based on staffing roles within our research and development departments 
as such  costs allocated to specific projects may not necessarily reflect the actual costs of those efforts and  therefore  we do not generally evaluate actual costs incurred information on a project by project basis 
in addition  we are unable to estimate the future costs to completion for any specific projects 
as of december   we revised the estimated depreciable life on certain leasehold improvements with a remaining carrying value of million 
as a result of this change  we expect to depreciate the remaining carrying value of these assets over the estimated remaining term on our underlying building operating lease  which expires in may we expect this change in estimate to increase our research and preclinical development depreciation expense by million and million in and  respectively 
research and preclinical development percentage decrease year ended percentage year ended december  increase december  decrease in thousands  except percentages over over personnel related    share based compensation na na external research and development    depreciation    other expenses including facilities overhead    total research and preclinical development expenses    comparison of years ended december  and the increases in our total research and preclinical development expenses for the year ended december   compared to  of million  were primarily due to changes in costs for the following million higher expenditures for external research and development services from third party service providers  primarily related to an increase in external preclinical animal studies and scientific consulting work to support the progress of our lead product candidates  av and av  as both programs transition into a clinical development phase  and the recognition of approximately  in non cash expense for share based compensation in compliance with fas r adopted january   partially offset by  million lower personnel related expenses  reflecting a significantly lower average staff level in as a result of a staff reduction initiated in august  partially offset by higher average salaries in  and million lower depreciation expenses  primarily as a result of the impairment charges for leasehold improvements and equipment that we recognized in comparison of years ended december  and the decreases in our total research and preclinical development expenses for the year ended december   compared to  of million  were primarily due to changes in costs for the following million lower personnel related expenses  reflecting a significantly lower average staff level in as a result of staff reductions initiated in july and august  partially offset by higher average salaries and higher severance expense in million lower expenditures for external research and development services from third party collaborators associated with our preclinical animal studies  primarily as a result of our completion of significant preclinical work with parkinson s disease in as it transitioned into a clinical development phase  million lower depreciation expenses  primarily as a result of the impairment charges for leasehold improvements and equipment that we recognized in  and million lower other expenses including facilities overhead  primarily reflecting a decrease in the amounts of materials consumed in compared to the previous year to produce aav vectors and support our other on going research activities in response to changes in our strategic direction which reduced our focus on aav based projects  and the general impact of our lower staff levels due to the staff reductions noted above 
clinical development percentage decrease year ended percentage year ended december  increase december  decrease in thousands  except percentages over over personnel related    share based compensation na na external research and development   depreciation  other expenses including facilities overhead  total clinical development expenses    comparison of years ended december  and the increase in our total clinical development expenses for the year ended december   compared to  of  were primarily due to changes in costs for the following million higher expenditures for external clinical development services from third party suppliers  associated with the preparation and initiation of clinical trials for av and av in compared to the level of services incurred in connection with our gene therapy trials in  and the recognition of approximately  in non cash expense for share based compensation in compliance with fas r adopted january   partially offset by  million lower other expenses including facilities overhead  primarily reflecting a decrease in the amount of square footage of the facilities used to support our clinical development and manufacturing activities which have primarily been subleased  and no depreciation expenses in  compared to depreciation expenses of  in  primarily as a result of the impairment charges for leasehold improvements and equipment that were associated with our manufacturing facilities that we recognized in comparison of years ended december  and the decreases in our total clinical development expenses for the year ended december   compared to  of million  were primarily due to changes in costs for the following million lower personnel related expenses  reflecting a significantly lower average staff level in as a result of staff reductions in july and august and lower severance related costs in  partially offset by higher average salaries in  million lower expenditures for external clinical development services from third party suppliers  associated with recruiting and treating subjects in our clinical trials  primarily as a result of the irregular pace of recruitment we experienced in our gene therapy trial for parkinson s disease  million lower depreciation expenses  primarily as a result of the impairment charges for leasehold improvements and equipment that we recognized in  and million lower other expenses  primarily due to a decrease in the amounts of materials consumed in compared to the prior year in connection with the production of clinical grade aav vectors to support the needs of our clinical trials  and a decrease in other costs associated with our transition out of gene therapy related activities 
total research and development expenses for were within management s expectations 
if we are successful in our efforts to develop our product candidates  including the costs of supporting multiple clinical trials in and thereafter  we expect our total research and development spending in future periods to rise 
general and administrative expenses percentage percentage increase increase year ended decrease year ended december  decrease december  in thousands  except percentages over over personnel related    share based compensation na na severance  legal and professional fees    facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses    total general and administrative expenses   comparison of the years ended december  and the increase of  in our general and administrative expenses in  compared to  was primarily due to changes in costs for the following the recognition of approximately  in non cash expense for share based compensation in compliance with fas r adopted january   and million higher severance expenses largely associated with the resignation of our former cfo in january  partially offset by  million lower legal and professional fees  primarily associated with patent filings and business contracts  and million lower personnel related expenses  reflecting a lower average staff level in  partially offset by higher average salaries during the year 
comparison of the years ended december  and the decrease of  in our general and administrative expenses in  compared to  was primarily due to changes in costs for the following million lower severance expenses largely due to the resignation of our former ceo in march  and million lower facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  almost entirely offset by  million higher legal and professional fees  primarily related to an increase in costs associated with being a public company and increased use of third party business consultants  and million higher personnel related expenses  reflecting higher average salaries and bonuses in  partially offset by a slightly lower staff level during the year 
we expect our current level of general and administrative expenses to continue in however  if we are successful in our efforts to develop our product candidates  we expect general and administrative spending levels may increase to connection with the changing needs of the company 
impairment loss related to long lived assets year ended december  in thousands impairment loss related to long lived assets  in connection with the organizational and structural changes initiated in  we determined that our future operations would not require the full capacity of our leased facilities  and we began to pursue potential cost savings through a sublease 
we determined that we would not recover fully the costs of our investment in leasehold improvements to the building and recorded an impairment charge of million in  to reduce the carrying value of certain leasehold improvements and equipment to zero 
this amount did not impact our cash flows in in  we recognized a contingent asset retirement obligation associated with certain leasehold improvements which we determined to be impaired in since the carrying value for these assets had been reduced to zero  the recognition of the liability resulted in an additional impairment loss related to long lived assets in this loss was not disclosed in our press release dated february   because at the time of our press release we were not aware we needed to make this adjustment 
we did not recognize any impairments to our long lived assets in in license fees year ended december  in thousands in license fees  in january  we entered into a license agreement and paid sanochemia a fee of million as consideration for an exclusive license to develop and commercialize proprietary formulations of the compound tolperisone  which we have named av  for the north american market 
we did not enter into any in license agreements in or interest expense year ended december  in thousands  except percentages interest expense percentage increase over prior period the increase in our interest expense between and reflects a rise in the average annual rate of interest charged during this period on our line of credit  which bears interest at a floating rate based on the london inter bank offered rate  and is reset in three or six month increments 
the outstanding balance of our loan payable had been million during   and interest income year ended december  in thousands  except percentages interest income    percentage increase decrease over prior period almost all of our interest income is generated from our investments in high grade marketable securities of government and corporate debt 
the increase in interest income between and was primarily due to the higher average outstanding balance of our total portfolio during the year  reflecting the million received from genzyme corporation in december and the million net proceeds from the private placement completed in may  as well as the increase in average yield earned on the portfolio 
the decline in interest income between and was primarily due to the lower average outstanding balance of the portfolio during  due to the use of such resources to fund our on going operations during the year  partially offset by a higher average yield 
sublease income year ended december  in thousands sublease income as of december  we subleased approximately  square feet of our aggregate facilities in two buildings to two separate corporate tenants not affiliated with avigen 
we will recognize remaining contractual  sublease income of million ratably over the remaining terms of the leases  which expire in may and november recently issued accounting standards see note  summary of significant accounting policies new accounting pronouncements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their effect  if any  on avigen  which discussion is incorporated by reference here 
deferred income tax assets in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes  which is described in the notes to our financial statements  we have calculated a deferred tax asset based on the potential future tax benefit we may be able to realize in future periods as a result of the significant tax losses experienced since our inception 
however  the value of such deferred tax asset must be calculated using the tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which such income occurs 
since we have no history of earnings  and cannot reliably predict when we might create taxable income  if at all  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our calculated deferred tax asset 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  cash expenditures have significantly exceeded our revenue 
we have funded our operations primarily through public offerings and private placements of our equity securities 
between may  the date of our initial public offering  and december  we raised million from private placements and public offerings of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock 
in may  we completed a private placement of common stock with institutional investors  raising approximately million in net proceeds 
the transaction represented the sale of approximately million shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share 
there were no warrants or other enhancements included in the transaction 
in addition to funding our operations through sales of our common stock  in march  we received million in research support from bayer corporation in connection with our collaboration on a gene therapy product for hemophilia  and in december  we received a million payment from genzyme corporation in connection with the assignment of rights to most of our previously developed aav based intellectual property  certain clinical trials and other gene therapy assets 
we have also attempted to contain costs and reduce cash flow by renting facilities  subleasing facilities no longer critical to our future operations  contracting with third parties to conduct research and development and using consultants  where appropriate 
we expect to incur additional future expenses  resulting in significant additional cash expenditures  as we continue our research and development activities  including our efforts to develop  manufacture  and commercialize our current drug candidates  expand our product portfolio with additional development candidates through internal research  acquisition or in licensing  and undertake additional preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates 
we also expect to incur substantial additional expenses relating to the filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities and restricted investments  of approximately million  compared to approximately million at december  and million at december  at december   and  million  million and million  respectively  of our investment portfolio were pledged to secure certain current and long term liabilities 
at december   and  the portion of our investment portfolio pledged as collateral  which we refer to as restricted investments  includes million for our line of credit and approximately  for letters of credit which serve as security deposits on one of our building leases 
the classification of million of these restricted investments as current assets at december  results from the classifications of the related loan payable  which is due in june of  as a current liability 
since the remaining liabilities represent deposits that are associated with our building leases which are not scheduled to expire in less than twelve months  the remaining restricted investments are classified as long term 
the reduction of million in total restricted investments between and was directly associated with our final payoff of previously collateralized equipment operating leases in december   which removed the need for the pledged investments 
our restricted investments would not be considered a current source of additional liquidity 
operating activities 
net cash used for operating activities was million for compared to million for the amount includes the payment of million during the year to sanochemia in connection with our in license agreement for av the amount includes the receipt of million in connection with our transaction with genzyme 
the remainder of the cash we used in operating activities for both years was primarily used to support our internal research and development activities  as well as preclinical studies and clinical trials performed by third parties  and general and administrative expenses 
net cash used for operating activities in was million compared to million for in addition to the impact of the genzyme payment in  the remaining decrease in cash used for operating activities in when compared to was due to lower expenditures during the year to support our research and development activities  including preclinical studies and clinical trials performed by third parties  and a reduction in the resources used to evaluate potential in license product opportunities 
the level of cash used in operating activities during and were in line with management s expectations 
investing and financing activities 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  which consisted primarily of purchases of available for sale securities  net of sales and maturities  compared to net cash provided by investing activities in of million  which consisted primarily of sales and maturities of available for sale securities  net of purchases  and the reduction in restricted investments 
net cash provided by financing activities in and was million and  respectively  and consisted of million of net proceeds from the private placement of out common stock to institutional investors in may  as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options during both years 
net cash provided by investing and financing activities in was million and  respectively 
the cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of sales and maturities of available for sale securities  net of purchases  offset to a small degree by purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants during the year 
the timing of and amounts realized from the exercise of previously issued stock options and warrants are determined by the decisions of the respective option and warrant holders  and are not controlled by us 
therefore  funds received from exercises of stock options and warrants in past periods should not be considered an indication of additional funds to be received in future periods 
during  we completed sublease agreements for approximately  square feet of our leased facilities  or percent  in order to reduce our future lease obligations 
we believe that the sum of scheduled sublease income and related reimbursement of operating costs associated with the portion of our facilities that are subleased will approximate million over the remaining lease terms  which are described below 
the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with debt obligations  lease obligations net of sublease income  and contractual commitments to fund third party research in thousands payments due by period less than contractual commitment total year years years operating leases     sublease income  net operating leases     revolving line of credit   research funding for third parties   total     our revolving line of credit is scheduled to expire on june   at which point a balloon payment of outstanding principal is due 
the debt instrument bears interest at a floating rate based on the london inter bank offered rate  which is reset in three or six month increments based on the date of each original drawdown  until expiration 
as of december  and  the average annual rate of interest charged on the borrowing was approximately and  respectively 
also under the terms of this agreement  we pledged a portion of our portfolio of available for sale securities as collateral and have identified the amount of the pledged securities as restricted investments on our balance sheets 
the amount of the pledged securities is equal to the amount of utilized borrowing capacity on the line of credit 
at december   we had borrowed million from the line of credit and had reserved the remaining million in borrowing capacity to secure a letter of credit in connection with the property lease entered into in november as a result  at december   we have no more borrowing capacity under this facility 
our current office and facility includes approximately  square feet of space 
of this  approximately  square feet of space is leased through may and approximately  square feet of space is leased through november as of december  we subleased approximately  square feet of our aggregate facilities in both buildings to two separate corporate tenants not affiliated with avigen 
we will recognize the remaining contractual  sublease income of million ratably over the remaining terms of the leases  which expire in may and november payments scheduled under these lease commitments and sublease agreements are included in the table above under operating leases and sublease income 
under the terms of our building lease that expires in may  we may be required  at our landlord s sole discretion  to remove  reconfigure or otherwise alter some improvements we have made to the facility 
if the landlord requires us to do so  this would impact our cash flows in future periods 
as discussed above in critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates impairment of property and equipment and asset retirement obligation  we remeasured the fair value of this contingent asset retirement obligation as of december  and recognized a liability of we enter into commitments to fund collaborative research and clinical work performed by third parties 
while these contracts are cancelable by either party  we expect the research studies and clinical work to be completed as defined in the terms of the agreements  and all amounts paid when due 
payments scheduled to be made under these contracts are included in the table above under research funding for third parties 
we believe we will continue to require substantial additional funding in order to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize our product candidates 
we believe that by keeping our staff level low and continuing to consolidate our operations and sublease additional portions of our current facilities  and with the proceeds provided by the private placement in may  our financial resources at december  will be adequate to fund our projected operating needs for approximately two to three years 
however  this forward looking statement is based upon our current plans and assumptions regarding our future operating and capital requirements  which may change 
our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patents claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs involved in obtaining licenses to patented technologies from third parties that may be needed to commercialize our product candidates  competing technological developments  the cost of manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and sales  the costs of sales  marketing and commercialization activities  how successful  if at all  we are at acquiring or in licensing additional compounds  and the nature of the consideration we pay for acquired or in licensed compounds  and other factors which may not be within our control 
we will need to obtain additional funding before we will be able to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates 
we cannot assure our investors that we will be able to enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms or at all 
without additional funding  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
we do not hold derivative financial investments  derivative commodity investments or other financial investments or engage in foreign currency hedging or other transactions that expose us to other market risks 
none of our investments are held for trading purposes 
our investment objectives are focused on preservation of principal and liquidity 
by policy  we manage our exposure to market risks by limiting investments to high quality issuers and highly liquid instruments with effective maturities of less than five years and an average aggregate portfolio duration of between one and three years 
our entire portfolio is classified as available for sale and  as of december  and  consisted of fixed rate securities 
we have evaluated the risk associated with our portfolios of investments in marketable securities and have deemed this market risk to be immaterial 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from their december  levels  we estimate that the fair value of our securities portfolio would decline by approximately  our estimated exposure at december  is higher than the estimated  exposure at december  due to the slight increase in the average maturity duration of the overall portfolio 
the modeling technique used measures duration risk sensitivity to estimate the potential change in fair value arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market rates and quantifies the ending fair market value including principal and accrued interest 
our long term debt includes a million revolving line of credit due june   of which we have drawn down million in cash that will need to be repaid 
interest charged on the borrowing is based on libor and is reset in three and six month increments based on the date of each original drawdown 
as of december   the average annual rate of interest charged on the borrowing was approximately compared to as of december
