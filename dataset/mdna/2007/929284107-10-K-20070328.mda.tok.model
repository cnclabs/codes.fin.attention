overview we are a radio frequency rf semiconductor company providing rf product solutions worldwide to communications equipment companies 
we design  develop and manufacture innovative  high performance products for both current and next generation wireless and cable networks  and rf identification rfid systems 
our rf product solutions are comprised of advanced  highly functional rf semiconductors  components and integrated assemblies which address the radio frequency challenges of these various systems 
we currently generate the majority of our revenue from our products utilized in wireless networks 
revenue from our products used in rf identification systems represents a less significant portion of our current revenue however we believe they represent one of our future growth opportunities 
the rf challenge is to create product designs that function within the unique parameters of different wireless system architectures 
our solution is comprised of design expertise  advanced device technology and manufacturability 
our communications products are used by telecommunication equipment manufacturers supporting and facilitating mobile communications  enhanced voice services  data and image transport 
our objective is to be the leading supplier of innovative rf semiconductors products 
during the fourth quarter of  we announced our decision to cease internal wafer manufacturing in early and to adopt the fabless semiconductor business model 
the fabless semiconductor model is more cost effective than having our own facility due to our limited volumes and the cost of developing and supporting our process technologies 
there is a viable commercial wafer foundry market which we plan to access for the production of our wafers and we may enter into limited process development activities with some of these vendors to further optimize the processes and our products 
in and we augmented our technology base and design capabilities with two acquisitions 
on january  we completed our acquisition of telenexus  inc telenexus 
we believe the addition of telenexus rfid products and technology will allow us to continue to enhance our rfid reader offerings to further capitalize on the market opportunity 
on june   we completed our acquisition of the wireless infrastructure business and associated assets from eic corporation  a california corporation and eic enterprises limited together eic 
we believe that the addition of eic s technical expertise further enhances wj s strategy of offering customers what we believe to be industry leading products for the wireless infrastructure market 
wj communications  inc formerly watkins johnson company  we  us  our or the company was formed after a recapitalization merger with fox paine on january  we were originally incorporated in california and reincorporated in delaware in august our principal executive offices are located at river oaks parkway  san jose  california  and our telephone number at that location is our internet address is www

our annual reports on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k  amendments to those reports and other securities and exchange commission  or sec  filings are available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with  or furnished to  the sec 
the information contained on our website is not intended to be part of this report 
our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global market and traded under the symbol wjci 
sales we sell our products to a broad group of communications original equipment manufacturers oems and their suppliers and subcontractors 
our major customers provide forecasted demand on at least a monthly basis  which assists us in managing our inventory requirements 
these forecasts  however  are subject to changes  including changes as a result of market conditions  and could fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
a majority of our sales in were to customers outside of the united states 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of our sales in  and  respectively 
most of our foreign sales were to customers located in china 
we depend on a small number of customers for a majority of our sales 
sales to our customers  which individually account for more than of our total annual sales were  in aggregate   and of our sales in december   and  respectively 
we have diversified our customer base over the last few years and intend to further diversify our customer base and product offering in the future 
however  we anticipate that we will continue to sell a majority of our products to a relatively small group of customers 
in addition  most of our sales result from purchase orders or contracts that can be cancelled on short term notice 
delays in manufacturing or supply procurement or other factors  including general market slow downs  have caused and could potentially continue to cause cancellation  reduction or delay in orders by or in shipments to a significant customer 
if the markets for our products decline  fail to grow  or grow more slowly than we anticipate  the use of our products may be reduced with a significant negative impact on our sales  earnings  inventory valuations and cash flow 
generally  the selling prices of our products tend to decrease over time as a result of increased volumes or general competitive pressures and in general we expect that prices will continue to decline as a result of volume increases or these competitive pressures 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct and indirect costs to produce our products and any write downs for excess or obsolete product that we do not believe we will be able to sell 
we recognize cost of goods sold upon recognition of revenue 
we recognize losses on contracts  including purchase order commitments  when identified 
we have not recognized such losses during  or research and development research and development expense represents wages  supplies and allocated overhead costs to design  develop and improve products and processes 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
we generate revenues from development contracts with customers that have enabled us to accelerate our own product development efforts 
such development revenues have only partially funded our product development activities  and we generally retain ownership of the products developed under these arrangements 
as a result  we classify all development costs related to these contracts as research and development expenses 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expense consists primarily of wages  travel and facility costs incurred by and other expenses allocated to our selling and administrative departments 
selling and administrative expense also includes manufacturer representatives and distributor sales commissions  trade show and advertising expenses and fees and expenses of legal  accounting  and other professional consultants 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a continuous basis  we evaluate all our significant estimates including those related to doubtful accounts receivable  inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring including accruals for abandoned lease properties  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for a detailed discussion of all our significant accounting policies 
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant estimations and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  also the brand awareness and the market position of the acquired products and assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
this sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
effective for our second quarter ended july   we changed the application of our revenue recognition policy regarding our distributors 
we had previously recognized revenue upon shipment to our distributors less estimated reserves for distributor right of return  authorized price reductions for specific end customer sales opportunities and price protection based on known events and historical trends 
effective for our second quarter ended july   we recognize revenue from our distribution channels when our distributors have sold the product to the end customer 
historically  we have received stock rotation requests from our distributors that were within the amounts estimated and contractually allowed with only one exception of an insignificant amount 
however  the request for stock rotation during our second quarter ended july  was higher than the amount contractually allowed 
our management  with the concurrence of our audit committee  believed the increasing percentage of our new product introductions makes it likely that stock rotation reserves will continue to be difficult to estimate based on historical patterns and contractual provisions 
based on this change in facts and circumstances and our management s future expectations  we believed that we could no longer reasonably estimate the amount of future returns from our distributors as of july  accordingly  beginning in our second quarter of  recognition of revenue and associated cost of sales on shipments to distributors is deferred until the resale to the end customer 
this change in application resulted in a million revenue deferral in our second quarter of although revenue is deferred until resale  title of products sold to distributors transfers upon shipment 
accordingly  shipments to distributors are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as accounts receivable and a reduction of inventories at the time of shipment 
deferred revenue and the corresponding cost of sales on shipments to distributors are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet on a net basis as deferred margin on distributor inventory 
for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
through the quarter ended april   revenues from our distributors were recognized upon shipment based on the following factors our sales price was fixed or determinable by contract at the time of shipment  payment terms were fixed at shipment and were consistent with terms granted to other customers  the distributor had full risk of physical loss  the distributor had separate economic substance  we had no obligation with respect to the resale of the distributor s inventory  and we believed we could reasonably estimate the potential returns from our distributor based on their history and our visibility in the distributor s success with its products and into the market place in general 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists  we accrued a reserve based on our reasonable estimate of future returns based on historical trends and contractual limitations 
as of april   our distributor stock rotation reserve was  beginning in september  we entered into a program where the distributor would receive a credit if it sold specific product at a reduced price to specific end customers pre authorized by us 
we maintain a log of all such pre authorized price reductions which we accrue as a reduction to revenue in the period that the pre authorization occurs per issue of eitf accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
through the quarter ended april   the ship debit allowance was offset solely by an offset to revenue 
since we began recognizing revenue from our distribution channels only when our distributors have sold the product to the end customer  the ship debit allowance will offset revenue only when the products with pre authorized price reductions have shipped to the end customer otherwise it will offset deferred margin on distributor inventory 
as of december  and our ship debit allowance was  and  respectively 
if we reduce the prices of our products as negotiated with the distributor  the distributor may receive a credit for the difference between the price paid by the distributor and the reduced price on applicable unsold products remaining in the distributor s inventory on the effective date of the price reduction assuming that inventory is less than months old as determined by the original invoice date 
when we recognized revenue upon shipment to our distributors  we reserved for distributor price protection per issue of eitf based on specific identification of our initiated price reductions and the associated reported distributor inventory 
there were no such price reductions in the years ended december   or we may enter into contracts to perform research and development for others meeting the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
research and development arrangements 
revenue under these development agreements is recognized when applicable contractual non refundable milestones have been met  including deliverables  and in any case  does not exceed the amount that would be recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based on the actual physical completion of work performed and the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs to complete the contract in accordance with accounting research bulletin long term construction type contracts using the relevant guidance in the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
for contracts including significant software development efforts  the provisions of sop software revenue recognition are also followed 
given the duration and nature of these development contracts  we believe that recognizing revenue under the percentage completion method best represents the legal and economic results of contract performance on a timely basis 
losses on contracts are recognized when determined 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the conditions become known 
these development contracts with customers have enabled us to accelerate our own product development efforts 
such development revenues have only partially funded our product development activities  and we generally retain ownership of the products developed under these arrangements 
as a result  we classify all development costs related to these contracts as research and development expenses 
the achievement of contractual milestones is evidenced by written documentation provided by the customer in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions of each contract 
in any period  progress on the contract is based on input measures direct labor dollars  direct material costs and direct outside processing costs in the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
estimated costs to complete are provided by engineering personnel directly involved in the development program and are reviewed by management and finance personnel for reasonableness given the known facts and circumstances 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 
if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made  then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed 
such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 
if we bill the customer prior to performing services under the development agreement  the amounts are recorded as deferred revenue 
our balance of deferred revenue was  and nil at december  and december   respectively 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of  and account for stock based compensation in accordance with  sfas r effective january  we elected the modified prospective method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted by reviewing annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting periods and the expected life assumptions of semiconductor peer companies 
our estimate of pre vesting option forfeitures is based on historical pre vest termination rates and those of semiconductor peer companies and we record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we considered along with our own actual experience the forfeiture rates of semiconductor peer companies due to our lack of extensive history 
our volatility assumption is forecasted based on our historical volatility over the expected term 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating loss  net loss and net loss per share 
in addition  we have issued options  restricted stock and performance accelerated restricted stock units whose vesting is based on the achievement of specified performance targets 
stock based compensation expense for these awards is recognized when achievement of the performance targets is probable  except for the performance accelerated restricted stock units where stock based compensation expense is recognized both on a graded vesting basis and when achievement of the performance targets is probable 
as a result of the unpredictability of the vesting of the performance based options  restricted stock and performance accelerated restricted stock units  our stock based compensation expense is subject to fluctuation 
the guidance in sfas r and sab is relatively new 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see notes and to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sfas r disclosures 
write down of excess and obsolete inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory for the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage  forecasted production generally based on a rolling twelve month demand forecast  current economic trends and historical write offs when evaluating the valuation of our inventory 
due to rapidly changing customer forecasts and orders  additional write downs of excess or obsolete inventory  while not currently expected  could be required in the future 
alternatively  the sale of previously written down inventory could result from unforeseen increases in customer demand 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill we periodically evaluate our intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets include goodwill and purchased technology 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if these criteria indicate that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value  and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
if an impairment charge is recognized  the amortization related to intangible assets would decrease during the remainder of the fiscal year 
income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  the company has established certain reserves for various federal  state and international income tax exposures 
the reserves represent our best estimate of the probable amount for our liability of income taxes  interest and penalties 
the actual liability could differ significantly from the amount of the reserve  which could have a material effect on our results of operations 
the tax benefit for the year ended december  of million resulted from a revision of our estimated tax liability based on the statute of limitations expiration of certain estimated state tax exposures during as of december  the balance of the contingent income tax liability is in addition  as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax provision benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current income tax provision benefit together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
restructuring during fiscal and  we recorded significant restructuring charges representing the direct costs of exiting certain product lines or businesses and the costs of downsizing our business 
such charges were established in accordance with the then applicable accounting standards emerging issues task force issue eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
these charges include abandoned leased properties comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and asset impairment charges on tenant improvements deemed no longer realizable 
in determining these estimates  we make certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sublease the space and reflect offsetting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate of current market conditions 
should there be a further significant change in market conditions  the ultimate losses on these could be higher and such amount could be material 
except for changes in the sublease estimates we have made from time to time  actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the restructuring charges 
on october   the company s board of directors committed the company to a restructuring plan to close and exit the company s milpitas fabrication facility fab during the first quarter of the milpitas fab produces some of the company s gallium arsenide semiconductor products and has substantial excess capacity 
the company s lease of the fab expired on november  and in accordance with the terms of the lease the company is continuing the lease on a month to month basis until the closure is complete 
the restructuring benefit and reversals are established in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the company formed a strategic foundry relationship with global communication semiconductors  inc gcs to second source the manufacturing of its gaas and ingap hbt wafers and gcs will become the sole source for these products after closing of the milpitas fab 
the company plans to produce additional wafer inventory from its milpitas fab to be used as a buffer in the event of delayed qualifications from customers or ramp up issues with gcs 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant technological changes  which would render equipment and manufacturing processes obsolete 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of these assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of our long lived assets could occur 
current operations the following table sets forth certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 
as a result of our new products  changing market conditions and other factors  the historical percentages and comparisons set forth below may not reflect our expected future operations

the increase in sales in is due to the substantial increase in demand for our products in the wireless infrastructure market particularly related to the growth of g systems 
this increased demand was particularly strong in asia where sales increased and europe where sales increased 
part of the sales growth in asia and europe is attributable to our direct shipments to our distributor s newly established overseas stocking hubs rather than shipping through the distributor s stocking hub in the united states which gives us greater visibility to end customer demand 
over the comparable twelve month periods  we have experienced an approximate decrease in the mix weighted average selling price of our semiconductor products 
units shipped in increased to million units from million units in sales in the comparable period in were also impacted by the change in application of our revenue recognition policy regarding sales to our distributors resulting in a million revenue deferral in our second quarter of for further discussion  see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
semiconductor and rfid sales during were million  representing of total sales which was a million or increase in comparison to the comparable s sales of million of total sales 
the increase in our semiconductor and rfid sales during primarily related to our increasing sales in asia particularly china  which increased and korea  which increased  our expanded product offering due to our acquisition of the wireless infrastructure business from eic corporation representing million of our semiconductor and rfid sales in compared to million in after the acquisition in june and an increase in our expanded rfid product offering due to our acquisition of telenexus representing million of our sales in during  we have experienced an approximate decrease in the average selling price of our semiconductor products due to competitive pressure 
the increase in our sales was partially offset by a change in the application of our revenue recognition policy from revenue recognition upon shipment to our distributors to revenue recognition when our distributors have sold the product to the end customer as discussed above under critical accounting policies and estimates 
the increase in our semiconductor and radio frequency identification rfid sales in mitigated the declines in our wireless integrated assembly and fiber optic sales reflecting our strategic decision to focus our competitive advantage and dedicate our resources to the radio frequency rf semiconductor market based on the same trends  we currently believe that our revenue will be in the range of million to million for cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold for was million  an increase of million or as compared with cost of goods sold of million in our cost of goods sold for increased by million or as compared with cost of goods sold of million in as a percentage of sales  our cost of goods sold decreased to in from in which increased from in the decrease in our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales reflects a favorable change in our product sales mix to higher margin semiconductor products 
this decrease was partially offset by inventory write downs to reduce excess inventories to their estimated net realizable value amounting to million for the majority of the excess inventory write down related to a faster than anticipated industry transition to lead free parts 
we also revised our depreciation estimates for certain equipment in the wafer fabrication facility resulting in increased depreciation of  in the fourth quarter over what the depreciation amount would have been 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our restructuring plan to close and exit our milpitas fabrication facility in the first quarter of the increase in our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales and in absolute dollars reflected an increase percentage of newer products in our product mix  which had not yet achieved the volumes  or yields of our more mature products with our transition to a fabless semiconductor manufacturing model and as our cost saving initiatives are realized  we expect cost of goods sold will decrease as a percentage of sales on a full year basis  continuing the trend we demonstrated through research and development our research and development expense was million  an increase of  or as compared with our research and development expense of million for our research and development for increased by  or as compared with research and development expense of million in the increase in research and development expense in is primarily related to stock compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas r  additional effort on engineering development agreements  increased spending on design consulting services and engineering wafer processing at outside foundries and which was partially offset by a decrease in overall overhead 
the increase in expense in is primarily related to the increased engineering staff and new product development efforts related to the products we acquired from telenexus and increased spending on design consulting services which was largely offset by a decrease in overall overhead 
the increase in research and development expense as a percentage of sales from to reflects the factors noted above as well as the decrease in sales 
we generate revenues from development contracts with customers that have enabled us to accelerate our own product development efforts 
such development revenues have only partially funded our product development activities  and we generally retain ownership of the products developed under these arrangements 
as a result  we classify all development costs related to these contracts as research and development expenses 
we recorded revenue of  and  under such development agreements in and  respectively 
product research and development is essential to our future success and we expect to continue making investments in new product development and engineering talent 
in we will continue to focus our research efforts and resources on semiconductor development targeting multiple growth markets such as rf amplifiers  mixer and converters for wireless infrastructure  base station power amplifiers  wimax and rfid 
we will also explore process capabilities of third party foundries and develop products under new process technologies such as sige bicmos 
we expect expenditures for new product development to increase although we expect a decrease in overall r d expense during as a result of significantly reducing process development costs as we move towards a fabless semiconductor manufacturing model 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expense for was million or of sales  an increase of million or as compared with selling and administrative expense of million or of sales in during selling and administrative expense increased by million or as compared with selling and administrative expense of million or of sales in the increase in expense during resulted from  increase in stock compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas r   intangible asset write off related to our decision to cease the use of the telenexus trademark and trade names intangible asset in favor of using the wj communications brand to market our rfid products   increase in salaries and wages due to increases in staffing   increase in bonus  a  increase in professional service fees   increase in travel expenses due to increased focus on our customers   increase in recruiting fees related to staffing  and partially offset by  decrease in severance payments to realign our workforce to our current objectives 
the increase in expense during related to a million charge for a former ceo separation agreement  a  increase related to the acquired administrative operations of telenexus   of professional fees related to a potential strategic business combination which we decided not to consummate  a  increase in legal fees resulting from additional corporate governance requirements  a  charge related to severance and a  increase in external sales representatives commission due to the increase in semiconductor sales over the prior year s period 
these increased costs were partially offset by a  decrease in bonus expense and a  decrease in insurance premiums 
acquired in process research and development expenses during  million of the purchase price for the acquisition of telenexus  inc was allocated to acquired in process research and development expense iprd 
projects that qualify as in process research and development represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no future alternative use 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is minimal remaining risk relating to the development which these projects did not possess at the time of the acquisition 
the value assigned to iprd charge comprised the following projects multi protocol readers million  smart readers  and class readers million 
the value of these projects was determined by estimating the discounted net cash flows from the sale of the products resulting from the completion of the projects  reduced by the portion of the revenue attributable to developed technology and the percentage of completion of the project 
as of december   these projects have been substantially completed within our estimated cost 
during  million of the purchase price for the acquisition of the wireless infrastructure business and associated assets from eic was allocated to acquired in process research and development expense iprd 
projects that qualify as in process research and development represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no future alternative use 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development 
restructuring charges on october   the company committed to a restructuring plan to close and exit the company s milpitas fabrication facility fab during the first quarter of the milpitas fab produces a substantial portion of the company s gallium arsenide semiconductor products and has substantial excess capacity 
the company s lease of the fab expired on november  and in accordance with the terms of the lease the company is continuing the lease on a month to month basis until the closure is complete 
the company formed a strategic foundry relationship with global communication semiconductors  inc gcs to second source the manufacturing of its gaas and ingap hbt wafers and gcs will become the sole source for these products after closing of the milpitas fab 
the company plans to produce additional wafer inventory from its milpitas fab to be used as a buffer in the event of delayed qualifications from customers or ramp up issues with gcs 
during the fourth quarter of   was recognized related to employee severance under the fourth quarter restructuring plan  which was offset by reversals of restructuring accurals of approximately  during  we reversed the lease loss associated with our internal wafer fabrication facility fab and remaining severance accrual under the third quarter and fourth quarter restructuring plans due to our assessment and subsequent decision to not close our fab as we believed at that time that integrating the newly acquired fab from eic with our pre existing fab will offer the company certain benefits over outsourcing the pre existing fab 
this reversal was partially offset by a net increase in the lease loss accrual for our other leased facilities based on reductions in sublease occupancy rates and a net increase in facility operating costs 
interest income interest income represents interest earned on cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments 
in our interest income was million  an increase of  or as compared with interest income of million in this increase resulted from an increase in interest rates offsetting a decrease in average funds available for investment 
our interest income for of million increased  or as compared with interest income of  in this increase also resulted from an increase in interest rates offsetting a decrease in average funds available for investment

based on our current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments together with available borrowings under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  we will utilize our cash  cash flows and borrowings to the extent available and  if desirable or necessary  we may seek to raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity 
there can be no assurances  however  that future borrowings and capital resources will be available on favorable terms or at all 
our cash flows are highly dependent on demand for our products  timing of orders and shipments with key customers and our ability to manage our working capital  especially inventory and accounts receivable  as well as controlling our production and operating costs in line with our revenue 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total we lease our two facilities  including our executive offices in san jose  california  under lease agreements that expire at various dates through total future lease obligations as of december   were million  of which million was recorded as a liability for certain facilities that were included in our restructuring accrual current and long term 
the milpitas facility lease expired on november   and we are continuing to make lease payments under the holdover provisions of the lease until we close the facility in purchase obligations are primarily orders for raw material  processed silicon wafers and assembly and test services 
while the purchase orders are generally cancelable without penalty  certain vendor agreements provide for percentage based cancellation fees or minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product or service 
we expect to receive and pay for these materials and services within the next six months 
the only component of other long term liabilities that requires us to make cash payments is a restructuring accrual of million relating to the future operating lease payments on certain facilities that were included in our restructuring plans see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
we will make these payments through we included these amounts in the operating lease total in the table above 
excluding payments under the operating lease component included in the restructuring accrual  the other components of other long term liabilities do not contractually require us to make cash payments and primarily consist of estimated operating costs on restructured facilities  deferred rent and estimated environmental costs the table above does not include possible contractual obligations related to our acquisition in june of the wireless infrastructure business and associated assets from eic which could have required the company to pay further consideration of up to million if specific revenue and gross margin targets were achieved by march  and the company has determined that the revenue and gross margin targets were not met for both of the periods and this was communicated to eic 
eic subsequently notified the company that it disagrees with the company s conclusions 
while the company believes eic s assertions were without merit and has notified eic of such  there are no assurances as to the eventual outcome of this matter 
for purposes of the table above  obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we have additional purchase orders not included in the table above that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations

change in filer status commencing with this annual report on form k we are no longer deemed to be an accelerated filer because our public float was below the required threshold as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter 
as a result of becoming a non accelerated filer  we are permitted to elect to suspend sarbanes oxley section obligations to provide a management s report on internal control over financial reporting and related auditor attestation report 
if we are still a non accelerated filer in we would be permitted to suspend the auditor attestation report for fiscal year we have elected to suspend our reporting obligations under section which election was approved by the audit committee 
during the period we are permitted to suspend our reporting obligations under section  we estimate that such election will save approximately  annually in external costs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
cash  cash equivalents and investments cash and cash equivalents consist of municipal bond funds and commercial paper acquired with remaining maturity periods of days or less and are stated at cost plus accrued interest which approximates market value 
short term investments consist primarily of high grade debt securities a rating or better with maturity greater than days from the date of acquisition and are classified as available for sale 
short term investments classified as available for sale are reported at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax  until realized 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will rise or fall in value if market interest rates change 
they are also subject to short term market risk 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio and constitutes a forward looking statement 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates
