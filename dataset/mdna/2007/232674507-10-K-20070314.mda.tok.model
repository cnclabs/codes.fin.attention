item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are committed to being the innovator and leader in providing products for the treatment of patients with functional somatic syndromes and other central nervous system disorders 
specifically  our strategy involves acquiring or in licensing central nervous system  or cns  active compounds and developing them for novel and typically underserved indications 
the term functional somatic 
table of contents syndromes refers to several related syndromes characterized more by symptoms  suffering and disability than by disease specific abnormalities that are found upon physical examination and include many overlapping pain and psychiatric conditions 
we pursue opportunities to acquire or in license cns active compounds in the areas in which the brain and body overlap  where cns mechanisms have a strong influence on somatic or bodily symptoms  and our ongoing development program is representative of this strategy 
our goal is to be one of the leading companies to commercialize a product approved in the united states for the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome  or fms  the focus of our initial efforts in the area of functional somatic syndromes 
in january  we entered into a collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  inc  a leading marketer of cns drugs with a strong franchise in the primary care and psychiatric markets  for the development and marketing of milnacipran 
in july  we completed the first phase iii trial for milnacipran  which was commenced in october we announced the top line results from this first phase iii trial in september although the results did not achieve statistical significance at the p level  we believe the preliminary results support continuation of the development program and the planned development program for milnacipran is continuing 
this development program includes a second phase iii study  which was commenced in october  and an additional third phase iii study  that was initiated in the first quarter of the second phase iii trial is a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled pivotal phase iii study with enrollment of approximately  fms patients 
recruitment into this trial is complete and we expect to announce initial results from the second phase iii trial in the second quarter of as agreed upon with the fda  for both the second phase iii study and the third phase iii study  our data will be analyzed based on three month patient data 
we are continuing to work with the fda on the statistical analysis plan for the second and third phase iii trials  which may result in modifications to the overall fms program 
additional information on our second and third phase iii studies can be found on the website located at www 
clinicaltrials 
gov 
additionally  in april  pierre fabre  in collaboration with cypress and forest  commenced in europe a phase iii trial for milnacipran for the treatment of fms 
we obtained an exclusive license for milnacipran from pierre fabre medicament in milnacipran has been marketed outside of the united states since as an antidepressant and has been used by over  patients worldwide 
we have paid pierre fabre a total of million  including upfront payments of million in connection with the execution of the original license agreement in and a million milestone payment in september  and issued pierre fabre  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock in connection with an amendment to the agreement with pierre fabre 
we are obligated to pay pierre fabre of any upfront and milestone payments received from forest laboratories as a sublicense fee 
as such  a million payment has been made to date 
after a total of million has been paid  any additional sublicense fees are credited against any subsequent milestone and royalty payments owed by us to pierre fabre 
if not used  these credits are carried forward to subsequent years 
additional payments to pierre fabre of up to a total of million will be due to pierre fabre based on meeting certain clinical and regulatory milestones 
under our agreement with forest laboratories  we sublicensed our rights to milnacipran to forest laboratories for the united states  with an option to extend the territory to include canada 
additionally  forest laboratories assumed responsibility for funding all continuing development of milnacipran  including the funding of clinical trials and regulatory approval  as well as a specified number of our employees 
however  we agreed upon an alternative cost sharing arrangement with forest laboratories for the second phase iii trial only 
in connection with this arrangement  the amount of funding that we receive from forest laboratories for certain of our employees has been eliminated as of the fourth quarter in for the second phase iii trial only  and we will pay for a majority of the external costs of the second phase iii trial only  with forest reimbursing us under specific scenarios where the second phase iii trial is used as one of the two required pivotal trials in the nda submission to the fda 
forest laboratories is funding the third phase iii clinical trial  including a specified number of our employees that are assisting with the conduct of that 
table of contents clinical trial 
forest laboratories will also be responsible for sales and marketing activities related to any product developed under the agreement  while we have the option to co promote up to of the total physician details using our own sales force and would be reimbursed by forest in an amount equal to forest s cost of providing the equivalent detailing calls 
in june  we announced the initiation of our second development program  wherein we evaluated potential pharmaceutical treatments for obstructive sleep apnea  or osa in collaboration with organon 
in june  we announced that the results of the completed phase iia trials conducted by us and organon did not support continuing a development program evaluating combinations of mirtazapine with another approved drug as potential pharmaceutical treatments for osa 
we are continuing to explore with organon new potential opportunities to continue the collaboration 
we are continuing to evaluate other various potential strategic transactions  including the potential acquisitions of products  technologies and companies  and other alternatives 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million and an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our future success depends on our ability to develop and market new products for the treatment of functional somatic syndromes  such as fms  and other central nervous system disorders 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues we recognized revenues under our collaborative agreement of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues under our collaborative agreement is primarily due to a decrease in sponsored development reimbursements during for costs incurred in connection with the first phase iii trial  which was completed during the second half of  and the extension trial to our first phase iii trial  which achieved full enrollment during the second quarter of this decrease in revenues under our collaborative agreement was partially offset by funding received from forest laboratories during for certain of our employees assisting with the conduct of the third phase iii clinical trial  which was initiated during the first quarter of the revenues recorded during and consist solely of amounts earned pursuant to our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  entered into in january  for the development and marketing of milnacipran 
such revenues include the recognition of the upfront payment of million from forest laboratories on a straight line basis over a period of years  sponsored development reimbursements and funding received from forest laboratories during for certain of our employees devoted to the development of milnacipran 
we currently are not generating any revenues from product sales and we do not expect to generate revenues from product sales for at least the next several years  if at all 
unless and until we generate revenues from product sales  we expect our revenues to consist of the continued recognition on a straight line basis of the upfront payment of million  sponsored development reimbursements and funding for certain of our employees devoted to the development of milnacipran 
we may also recognize future milestone payments under our agreement with forest laboratories  which are contingent upon the achievement of agreed upon objectives and which are not guaranteed payments 
in connection with our arrangement with forest laboratories regarding cost sharing arrangements for the second phase iii trial only  the amount of funding that we received from forest laboratories for certain of our employees was eliminated as of the fourth quarter in and resumed with the initiation of the third phase iii trial in the 
table of contents first quarter of additionally  the amount of sponsored development reimbursements from forest laboratories changes periodically based on the level of development activity 
our collaboration agreement is subject to early termination by forest laboratories upon specified events  including breach of the agreement 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year december  the decrease in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to a decrease in costs incurred during due to the completion of our first phase iii trial during the second half of and full enrollment of the extension trial to our first phase iii trial during the second quarter of and a decrease in costs incurred during in connection with our osa program  which was discontinued during the second quarter of also contributing to the decrease were license fees of million including a warrant valued at million to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of issued to organon in connection with the licensing agreement incurred during related to our prior osa program 
the decrease in research and development expenses during was partially offset by an increase in costs incurred during in connection with the second phase iii trial  which was increased in size in january  the initiation of our third phase iii trial during the first quarter of and the recognition of stock based compensation expense for employee stock options in connection with the adoption of fas r on january  during the year ended december   we incurred total costs of million in connection with our phase iii programs compared to a total of million during the year ended december  the costs for the first phase iii clinical trial  the extension trial and the third phase iii clinical trial are being reimbursed by forest laboratories as noted above 
effective january   pursuant to our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  forest laboratories assumed responsibility for funding all continuing development of milnacipran  including the funding of clinical trials and regulatory approvals 
this funding received from forest laboratories for sponsored development reimbursements is included as a component of our revenue under collaborative agreement on the statement of operations 
we agreed upon an alternative cost sharing arrangement with forest laboratories for the second phase iii trial only 
in connection with this arrangement  we will pay for a majority of the external costs of the second phase iii trial only  with forest reimbursing us under specific scenarios where the second phase iii trial is used as one of the two required pivotal trials in the nda submission to the fda 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the recognition of stock based compensation expense of million for employee stock options in connection with the adoption of fas r on january  this increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a success based fee paid to advisors during the second quarter of in connection with the closing of our licensing agreement with organon 
in addition  as discussed below in compensation benefit variable stock options  we recognized a compensation benefit for variable stock options of million related to general and administrative expenses for the year ended december

research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to costs incurred during in connection with the extension trial to our first phase iii trial  which commenced during the third quarter of and had a full year of activity during  and our second phase iii trial for milnacipran  which commenced during the fourth quarter of and had a full year of activity during  payment of license fees of million and a non cash charge of million incurred due to the issuance of a warrant to organon in connection with the licensing agreement related to our osa program and costs incurred in connection with various 
table of contents proof of concept studies for our sleep apnea program 
this increase in research and development expenses during was partially offset by several non recurring expenses incurred in  including a million sublicense fee paid to pierre fabre recorded during the first quarter of in connection with our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories and a payment for the exercise of our option in january to acquire an exclusive license to technology developed under our reformulation and new product agreement with collegium  and a decrease during in costs incurred in connection with the first phase iii trial  which was completed during the second half of during  we incurred total costs of million in connection with our phase iii programs compared to a total of million including the million sublicense fee to pierre fabre during the costs for the first phase iii clinical trial and extension trial are being reimbursed by forest laboratories as noted below 
in addition  as discussed below in compensation benefit variable stock options  we recognized a compensation benefit for variable stock options of and  related to research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to non recurring costs incurred during  consisting of a success based fee paid to our investment bankers in connection with the closing of our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories in january  a one time fee associated with our being listed during the first quarter of on the nasdaq stock market and non cash compensation charges recorded during the first quarter of  consisting of million related to stock options previously granted to consultants and two former board members for services that vested upon the completion of the collaboration agreement with forest laboratories and million in connection with the accounting treatment for stock options related to the resignation of certain board members to roles as consultants during the first quarter of additionally  we incurred lower consulting fees and travel expenses during in connection with business development activities 
this decrease in general and administrative expenses during was partially offset by a success based fee paid to advisors during the second quarter of in connection with the closing of our licensing agreement with organon 
in addition  as discussed below in compensation benefit variable stock options  we recognized a compensation benefit for variable stock options of million and  related to general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
compensation benefit variable stock options in connection with the option cancel and re grant program implemented in  which resulted in variable accounting for the newly issued options under fin  we recognized a compensation benefit of million  consisting of related to research and development expenses and million related to general and administrative expenses  during the year ended december  as the intrinsic value of the common stock underlying the options declined due to a decrease in our stock price during the period 
similarly  due to a decrease in our stock price during the year ended december   we recognized a compensation benefit of  consisting of  related to research and development expenses and  related to general and administrative expenses 
interest income interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income for the year ended december  
table of contents compared to the corresponding period in is due to higher cash and investment balances during and a general increase in interest rates and related yields experienced during liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million compared to cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  working capital at december  totaled million compared to million at december  we have invested a substantial portion of our available cash in high quality marketable debt instruments of governmental agencies  commercial paper and certificates of deposit  which are within federally insured limits 
we have established guidelines relating to our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
net cash used in operating activities as disclosed in our statement of cash flows was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the primary use of cash during the years ended december  and were actual expenditures to fund our operating activities during the periods  offset by net collections of amounts due from forest laboratories 
net cash provided by investing activities as disclosed in our statement of cash flows was million for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the fluctuation in net cash from investing activities during the year ended december  compared to the corresponding prior year period was primarily a result of a significant net increase in the proceeds from the sale of short term securities during compared to net cash provided by financing activities as disclosed in our statement of cash flows was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities during compared to was primarily the result of proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of stock options during compared to proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of stock options and warrants during the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations at december  less than year years after years total operating leases purchase obligations total purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services  including consulting services  that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 
this includes contracts that are cancelable with notice and the payment of an early termination penalty 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty and also exclude liabilities to the extent presented on the balance sheet as of december  other commercial commitments include certain potential milestone  sublicense and royalty payments to pierre fabre as discussed in the overview section and milestone payments of up to 
table of contents million to collegium pharmaceutical  inc in connection with the reformulation and new product agreement entered into with collegium  a portion of which was paid in the second quarter of contractual obligations for which we will be reimbursed by forest laboratories are not included in the table above 
the above also does not include the external costs of the second phase iii trial for fms that we have agreed to fund 
additionally  in september  we amended our current lease agreement  which was set to expire in july  for our executive and administrative offices  whereby the term of the lease was extended to july as reflected in the table above 
unless and until we can consistently generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities and from revenue under our collaboration agreement with forest and if available to us  cash from financings 
we currently have a shelf registration statement on file that would allow us to issue up to million in shares but we do not have any current intentions to engage in a financing and no current intended purchasers 
our current expected primary cash needs on both a short term and long term basis are for the development of milnacipran and general research  working capital and other general corporate purposes and the identification  acquisition or license  and development of potential future products 
in addition to the amounts required to pay any amounts payable under our agreements with pierre fabre and collegium  the costs of in licensing or acquiring additional compounds or companies and funding clinical development for any product other than our fms product that we may in license or acquire  we estimate that  based on our current business plan  we will require approximately million to fund our operations for the year one of our ongoing goals is to identify and in license new products 
in the event we acquire  license or develop any new products  the amount to fund our operations for would increase  possibly materially 
our net losses will continue for at least the next several years as we seek to acquire  license or develop additional products for the treatment of functional somatic syndromes and other central nervous system disorders 
such losses may fluctuate  and the fluctuations may be substantial 
based on our current business plan  we believe our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at december  are sufficient to fund operations through at least however  we are actively continuing to evaluate various potential strategic transactions  including the potential acquisitions of products and companies  and other alternatives 
in order to acquire or develop additional products  we will require additional capital 
the amount of capital we require is dependent upon many forward looking factors that could significantly increase our capital requirements  including the following the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products and businesses  the costs of in licensing drug candidates  the ability of forest laboratories and us to reach milestones  and other events or developments under our collaboration agreement  the costs and timing of development and regulatory approvals for milnacipran  and the costs of commercialization of any future products 
because we are unable to predict the outcome of the foregoing factors  some of which are beyond our control  we are unable to estimate with certainty our mid to long term capital needs 
unless and until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue  if ever  we expect to finance future capital needs through public or private debt or equity offerings or collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as 
table of contents interest income earned on cash balances 
we do not currently have any commitments or specific plans for future external funding 
we may not be able to raise additional capital and the funds we raise  if any  may not allow us to maintain our current and planned operations 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development of existing or future product candidates 
to date  we have not had any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  research and development expenses and share based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are the critical accounting policies that affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements see also the notes to our financial statements 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
amounts received for upfront license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period such arrangements require on going services or performance 
accordingly  the upfront payment of million from forest laboratories is being recognized over a period of years  which represents the estimated period of significant on going services and performance  including the development period  under our agreement with forest laboratories 
amounts received for sponsored development activities  including funding received for certain of our employees  are recognized as research costs are incurred over the period specified in the related agreement or as the services are performed 
amounts received for milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone  which requires substantive effort and was not readily assured at the inception of the agreement 
any amounts received prior to satisfying revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred revenue 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for our research and development personnel  fees paid to external service providers to conduct clinical trials  patient enrollment costs  fees and milestone payments under our license and development agreements and costs for facilities  supplies  materials and equipment 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
we accrue clinical trial expenses based on work performed  which relies on estimates of total costs incurred based on completion of patient studies and other events 
actual clinical trial costs may differ from estimated 
table of contents clinical trial costs and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
historically  adjustments have not resulted in material changes to research and development expenses  however  a modification in the protocol of a clinical trial or cancellation of a trial could result in a charge to our results of operations 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of revised sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes a compensation expense for all stock based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation expense for all stock based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
share based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the year ended december  was million 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model 
this estimate is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex inputs that require us to make significant estimates and judgments 
these inputs include the expected term of employee stock options  the expected volatility of our stock price  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on the output derived under the simplified method  as allowed under sab we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant using our historical price volatility based on our assessment that this approach is the most representative of future stock price trends 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
sfas r requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we have very few employees and our historical turnover has been minimal 
therefore  we have not estimated forfeitures and instead adjust our stock based compensation expense as forfeitures occur 
we believe that the impact on share based compensation between estimating forfeitures and recording the impact as the forfeitures occur would not be material 
for options granted before january  and on or after january   we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
as noted above  in order to calculate the compensation expense that we must recognize  we must make a variety of assumptions  all of which are based on our beliefs  expectations and assumptions at the time the assumptions are made 
these beliefs  expectations and assumptions may vary over time and we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share

sfas applies whenever other standards required or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have invested our excess cash in united states government securities  commercial paper  certificates of deposit and money market funds with strong credit ratings 
as a result  our interest income is most sensitive to changes in the general level of united states interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the investment grade securities we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates
