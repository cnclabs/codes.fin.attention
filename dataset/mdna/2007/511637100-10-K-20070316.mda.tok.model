you should read this section in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data that is presented on the preceding page as well as the accompanying financial statements and notes to financial statements 
as used in the following discussion  the term company refers to lakeland bancorp  inc and lakeland refers to the company s wholly owned banking subsidiary lakeland bank 
the newton trust company newton was merged into lakeland on november  newton financial corporation nfc  the parent company of newton  was merged into the company on july  and community state bank csb was merged into lakeland on august  statements regarding forward looking information the information disclosed in this document includes various forward looking statements that are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of with respect to credit quality including delinquency trends and the allowance for loan and lease losses  corporate objectives  and other financial and business matters

significant accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company and lakeland conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and predominant practices within the banking industry 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  lakeland  lakeland investment corp  and lakeland nj investment corp 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions also affect reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates implicit in these financial statements are as follows 
the principal estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the allowance for loan and lease losses  the company s deferred tax asset and the analysis of goodwill impairment 
the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses includes  among other factors  an analysis of historical loss rates  by category  applied to current loan totals 
however  actual losses may be higher or lower than historical trends  which vary 
actual losses on specified problem loans  which also are provided for in the evaluation  may vary from estimated loss percentages  which are established based upon a limited number of potential loss classifications 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense 
loan principal considered to be uncollectible by management is charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the evaluation takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and size of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  specific problem loans  and current economic conditions which may affect the borrowers ability to pay 
the evaluation also details historical losses by loan category  the resulting loss rates for which are projected at current loan total amounts 
loss estimates for specified problem loans are also detailed 
all of the factors considered in the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses may be subject to change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
the company accounts for impaired loans in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that as a practical expedient  a creditor may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
regardless of the measurement method  a creditor must measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral when the creditor determines that foreclosure is probable 
the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
deferred tax expense is the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the principal types of differences between assets and liabilities for financial statement and tax return purposes are allowance for loan and lease losses  core deposit intangible  deferred loan fees  deferred compensation and securities available for sale 
the company accounts for goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas no 
includes requirements to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment rather than amortize them 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level using various market valuation methodologies 
the company has tested the goodwill as of december  and has determined that it is not impaired 
financial overview the year ended december  represented a year of continued growth for the company 
in  the company opened two new branches and sold one branch in a non contiguous market 
the company also completed a balance sheet restructuring where it sold million in securities yielding in order to lower its borrowings and to fund loan growth resulting in improved net interest income in future periods 
as discussed in this management s discussion and analysis total loans and leases increased by million or 
lakeland sold million in securities in fourth quarter for a loss of million to lower its borrowings and to fund loan growth 
net income decreased million or from to  primarily as a result of the balance sheet restructuring discussed above 
net income for was million or per diluted share compared to net income of million and per diluted share in for  return on average assets was and return on average equity was

the impact of the loss of million resulting from the balance sheet restructuring  and the write off of  in costs related to a stock offering  which the company elected not to complete  reduced after tax income by million or per share 
in  net income was million or per diluted share with a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets and the cost of funds supporting those assets 
the company s net interest income is determined by i the volume of interest earning assets that it holds and the yields that it earns on those assets  and ii the volume of interest bearing liabilities that it has assumed and the rates that it pays on those liabilities 
net interest income increases when the company can use noninterest bearing deposits to fund or support interest earning assets 
net interest income for on a tax equivalent basis was million  representing a decrease of million or from the million earned in net interest income for on a tax equivalent basis was million 
the decrease in net interest income from to resulted from an increase in the company s cost of funds of basis points and a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities partially offset by a million increase in average interest earning assets and a basis point increase in the yield on average interest earning assets 
the increase in net interest income in from resulted from an increase in earning assets of million partially offset by a million increase in interest bearing liabilities and a basis point increase in the cost of funds 
factors contributing to the decline in the net interest margin will be discussed in further detail below 
interest income and expense volume rate analysis 
the following table shows the impact that changes in average balances of the company s assets and liabilities and changes in average interest rates have had on the company s net interest income over the past three years 
this information is presented on a tax equivalent basis assuming a tax rate 
if a change in interest income or expense is attributable to a change in volume and a change in rate  the amount of the change is allocated proportionately

b includes interest bearing cash accounts 
c net interest income divided by interest earning assets 
total interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
the increase in interest income from to was primarily due to a million increase in interest earning assets due to growth in the loan portfolio 
the increase in interest income was also due to a basis point increase in the average yield on earning assets due to the increasing rate environment and to a shift in the company s mix in earning assets from lower yielding investment securities and federal funds sold to higher yielding loans 
loans as a percent of average interest earning assets increased from in to in the increase in interest income from million in to million in resulted from a million increase in average interest earning assets and a basis point increase in the yield on average interest earning assets reflecting an increasing rate environment and a shift in the company s mix in earning assets from lower yielding investment securities to higher yielding loans 
total interest expense increased from million in to million in as a result of an increase in average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities from in to in an increase in interest bearing liabilities of million to billion in also contributed to the increase in interest expense 
a change in the mix of the deposits from lower costing core deposits to higher costing time deposits also had the effect of increasing the company s cost of funds 
average savings and interest bearing transaction accounts decreased from of total interest bearing liabilities in to in noninterest bearing demand deposits also decreased from million in to million in higher yielding time deposits increased from of interest bearing liabilities in to of total deposits in interest expense increased from million in to million in due to the increase in the volume of interest bearing liabilities of million and to an increase in the cost of funds of basis points 
the cost of funds increased as a result of an increase in market interest rates and from a shift from core deposits to time deposits 
net interest margin net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis by average interest earning assets 
the company s net interest margin was  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in the net interest margin from to resulted from deposits repricing faster than interest earning assets and from a shift in interest bearing liabilities from core deposits to time deposits and borrowings 
the basis point increase in the average yield on interest earning assets and the basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities resulted in a lower net interest spread and a lower net interest margin 
the decrease in the net interest margin from to also resulted from interest bearing liabilities repricing faster than interest earning assets 
provision for loan and lease losses in determining the provision for loan and lease losses  management considers national and local economic conditions  trends in the portfolio including orientation to specific loan types or industries  experience  ability and depth of lending management in relation to the complexity of the portfolio  adequacy and adherence to policies  procedures and practices  levels and trends in delinquencies  impaired loans and net charge offs and the results of independent third party loan review

noninterest income increased million or to million in from million in and represented of total revenue for a primary source of this increase in revenue was an increase in service charges on demand deposit accounts from million in to million in  a million or increase 
this increase resulted from fee income generated by lakeland s overdraft privilege program implemented in second quarter of and a full year of income from the newton branches

partially offsetting the increased salary and benefit costs were declines in medical insurance expense relating to a revision of the company s medical insurance program which resulted in a  or decrease in costs from to stationery  supplies and postage expense declined  or from million in to million in primarily as a result of decreased supply expenses resulting from the merger of newton into lakeland 
legal fees declined from  in to  in resulting from a recovery of litigation costs from the company s insurance carrier related to the purchased lease pools discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies litigation

the remainder of the increase in other expenses resulted from a full year of expenses related to newton and expense related to our increased customer base 
the efficiency ratio expresses the relationship between non interest expense excluding other real estate expense and core deposit amortization to total tax equivalent revenue excluding gains losses on sales of securities 
in  the company s efficiency ratio on a tax equivalent basis increased to from in the efficiency ratio was in the increase in the efficiency ratio from to resulted from a decline in total revenue during that period 
the ratio of noninterest expense to average assets is another measure of efficiency for a financial institution 
noninterest expense as a percent of average assets decreased to in from in and in the decline in this ratio reflects efficiencies realized from merging newton into lakeland and other expense reductions discussed above

the following table sets forth the classification of the company s loans by major category as of december for each of the last five years december  in thousands commercial leases real estate mortgage real estate construction home equity and consumer installment the following table shows the percentage distributions of loans by category as of december for each of the last five years 
december  commercial leases real estate mortgage real estate construction home equity and consumer installment at december   there were no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans outstanding other than loans that are secured by real estate 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other related conditions 
the following table sets forth certain categories of loans as of december   in terms of contractual maturity date within one year after one but within five years after five years total in thousands types of loans commercial real estate construction total amount of such loans with predetermined rates floating or adjustable rates total risk elements commercial loans and leases are placed on a non accrual status with all accrued interest and unpaid interest reversed if a because of the deterioration in the financial position of the borrower they are maintained on a cash basis which means payments are applied when and as received rather than on a regularly scheduled basis  b payment in full of interest or principal is not expected  or c principal and interest has been in default for a period of days or more unless the obligation is both well secured and in process of collection 
residential mortgage loans are placed on non accrual status at the time when foreclosure proceedings are commenced except where there exists sufficient collateral to cover the defaulted principal and interest payments  and management s knowledge of the specific circumstances warrant continued accrual 
consumer loans are generally charged off when principal and interest payments are four months in arrears unless the obligations are well secured and in the process of collection 
interest thereafter on such charged off consumer loans is taken into income when received only after full recovery of principal 
the following schedule sets forth certain information regarding the company s non accrual  past due and renegotiated loans and other real estate owned as of december  for each of the last five years at december  in thousands non performing assets non accrual loans other real estate owned total non performing assets non performing assets as a percent of total assets past due loans represents loans as to which payments of interest or principal are contractually past due ninety days or more  but which are currently accruing income at the contractually stated rates 
a determination is made to continue accruing income on such loans only if collection of the debt is proceeding in due course and collection efforts are reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debt or in its restoration to a current status 
non accrual loans increased from million at december  to million on december  in  non accruals decreased million from the prior year  resulting primarily from the settlement with the one remaining surety company which had guaranteed the income stream of million of commercial lease pools 
the settlement included a million principal payment and a charge off of the remaining million 
other real estate owned decreased from  in to in as a result of the sale of other real estate property that had been acquired in the newton acquisition 
all non accrual loans are in various stages of litigation  foreclosure  or workout 
for  the gross interest income that would have been recorded  had the loans classified at year end as non accrual been performing in conformance with their original loan terms  is approximately  the amount of interest income actually recorded on those loans for was  the resultant income of  for compares to losses of  and million for and  respectively 
loans specifically evaluated are deemed impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements 
loans which are in process of collection will not be classified as impaired 
a loan is not impaired during the process of collection of payment if the company expects to collect all amounts due  including interest accrued at the contractual interest rate 
all commercial loans identified as impaired in excess of  are evaluated by an independent loan review consultant 
the company aggregates consumer loans and residential mortgages for evaluation purposes 
the company s policy concerning commercial non accrual loans states that  except for loans which are considered to be fully collectible by virtue of collateral held and in the process of collection  loans are placed on a non accrual status when payments are days delinquent or more 
it is possible for a loan to be on non accrual status and not be classified as impaired if the balance of such loan is relatively small and  therefore  that loan has not been specifically reviewed for impairment 
loans  or portions thereof  are charged off in the period that the loss is identified 
until such time  an allowance for loan loss is maintained for estimated losses 
with regard to interest income recognition for payments received on impaired loans  as well as all non accrual loans  the company follows regulatory guidelines  which apply any payments to principal as long as there is doubt as to the collectibility of the loan balance 
as of december   based on the above criteria  the company had impaired loans totaling million including million in non accrual loans 
the impairment of these loans is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral for these loans 
based upon such evaluation   has been allocated to the allowance for loan and lease losses for impairment 
at december   the company also had million in loans that were rated substandard and  rated as doubtful that were not classified as non performing or impaired 
there were no loans at december   other than those designated non performing  impaired  substandard or doubtful where the company was aware of any credit conditions of any borrowers that would indicate a strong possibility of the borrowers not complying with the present terms and conditions of repayment and which may result in such loans being included as non accrual  past due or renegotiated at a future date 
the following table sets forth for each of the five years ended december   the historical relationships among the amount of loans outstanding  the allowance for loan and lease losses  the provision for loan and lease losses  the amount of loans charged off and the amount of loan recoveries december  in thousands balance of the allowance at the beginning of the year loans charged off commercial leases home equity and consumer real estate mortgage total loans charged off recoveries commercial leases home equity and consumer real estate mortgage total recoveries net charge offs addition related to acquisitions provision for loan and lease losses charged to operations ending balance ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding ratio of allowance at end of year as a percentage of year end total loans includes charge offs of million  million and million in  and  respectively  related to the settlement of litigation concerning the commercial lease pools which are further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to loans outstanding reflects management s evaluation of the underlying credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements is the responsibility of management 
the evaluation process is undertaken on a quarterly basis 
methodology employed for assessing the adequacy of the allowance consists of the following criteria the establishment of reserve amounts for all specifically identified classified loans that have been designated as requiring attention by the company or the company s external loan review consultant 
the establishment of reserves for pools of homogeneous types of loans not subject to specific review  including family residential mortgages  and consumer loans 
the establishment of reserve amounts for the non classified loans in each portfolio based upon the historical average loss experience for these portfolios and management s evaluation of key factors 
consideration is given to the results of ongoing credit quality monitoring processes  the adequacy and expertise of the company s lending staff  underwriting policies  loss histories  delinquency trends  and the cyclical nature of economic and business conditions 
since many of the company s loans depend on the sufficiency of collateral as a secondary source of repayment  any adverse trend in the real estate markets could affect underlying values available to protect the company from loss 
based upon the process employed and giving recognition to all accompanying factors related to the loan portfolio  management considers the allowance for loan and lease losses to be adequate at december  the preceding statement constitutes a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the following table shows how the allowance for loan and lease losses is allocated among the various types of loans that the company has outstanding 
this allocation is based on management s specific review of the credit risk of the outstanding loans in each category as well as historical trends

lakeland can offer new products or change its rate structure in order to increase deposits 
in  the company generated million in deposit growth excluding the impact of the sale of one branch in first quarter sales of securities and overnight funds 
at year end  the company had million in securities designated available for sale 
overnight credit lines 
lakeland is a member of the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb 
one membership benefit is that members can borrow overnight funds 
lakeland has lines of credit totaling million available for it to borrow from the fhlb 
lakeland also has overnight federal funds lines available for it to borrow up to million 
the company s management believes that its current level of liquidity is sufficient to meet its current and anticipated operational needs including current loan commitments  deposit maturities and other obligations 
this constitutes a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results could differ materially from anticipated results due to a variety of factors  including uncertainties relating to general economic conditions  unanticipated decreases in deposits  changes in or failure to comply with governmental regulations  and uncertainties relating to the analysis of the company s assessment of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities and the extent to which market factors indicate that a financial institution such as lakeland should match such assets and liabilities 
the following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of december  dollars in thousands total within one year after one but within three years after three but within five years after five years minimum annual rentals or noncancellable operating leases benefit plan commitments remaining contractual maturities of time deposits subordinated debentures loan commitments long term borrowed funds standby letters of credit total interest rate risk closely related to the concept of liquidity is the concept of interest rate sensitivity ie  the extent to which assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is often measured by the extent to which mismatches or gaps occur in the repricing of assets and liabilities within a given time period 
gap analysis is utilized to quantify such mismatches 
a positive gap results when the amount of earning assets repricing within a given time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities repricing within that time period 
a negative gap results when the amount of interest bearing liabilities repricing within a given time period exceeds the amount of earning assets repricing within such time period 
in general  a financial institution with a positive gap in relevant time periods will benefit from an increase in market interest rates and will experience erosion in net interest income if such rates fall 
likewise  a financial institution with a negative gap in relevant time periods will normally benefit from a decrease in market interest rates and will be adversely affected by an increase in rates 
by maintaining a balanced interest rate sensitivity position  where interest rate sensitive assets roughly equal interest sensitive liabilities in relevant time periods  interest rate risk can be limited 
as a financial institution  the company s potential interest rate volatility is a primary component of its market risk 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
based upon the company s nature of operations  the company is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the company does not own any trading assets and does not have any hedging transactions in place  such as interest rate swaps and caps 
the company s board of directors has adopted an asset liability policy designed to stabilize net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements 
this policy outlines guidelines and ratios dealing with  among others  liquidity  volatile liability dependence  investment portfolio composition  loan portfolio composition  loan to deposit ratio and gap analysis ratio 
the company s performance as compared to the asset liability policy is monitored by its board of directors 
in addition  to effectively administer the asset liability policy and to monitor exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  the company maintains an asset liability committee  consisting of the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief lending officer  chief retail officer  chief credit officer  certain other senior officers and certain directors 
this committee meets quarterly to review the company s financial results and to develop strategies to implement the asset liability policy and to respond to market conditions 
the company monitors and controls interest rate risk through a variety of techniques  including use of traditional interest rate sensitivity analysis also known as gap analysis and an interest rate risk management model 
with the interest rate risk management model  the company projects future net interest income  and then estimates the effect of various changes in interest rates and balance sheet growth rates on that projected net interest income 
the company also uses the interest rate risk management model to calculate the change in net portfolio value over a range of interest rate change scenarios 
traditional gap analysis involves arranging the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by repricing periods and then computing the difference or interest rate sensitivity gap between the assets and liabilities that are estimated to reprice during each time period and cumulatively through the end of each time period 
both interest rate sensitivity modeling and gap analysis are done at a specific point in time and involve a variety of significant estimates and assumptions 
interest rate sensitivity modeling requires  among other things  estimates of how much and when yields and costs on individual categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will respond to general changes in market rates  future cash flows and discount rates 
gap analysis requires estimates as to when individual categories of interest sensitive assets and liabilities will reprice  and assumes that assets and liabilities assigned to the same repricing period will reprice at the same time and in the same amount 
gap analysis does not account for the fact that repricing of assets and liabilities is discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity repricing structure of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  except as stated below  the amounts of assets or liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of each asset or liability 
the majority of interest bearing demand deposits and savings deposits are assumed to be core deposits  or deposits that will generally remain at the company regardless of market interest rates 
therefore  of the core interest bearing deposits  of core savings deposits and of money market deposit accounts are shown as maturing or repricing within three months 
the remainder is divided between the after but within years column and the after years column 
interest bearing transaction accounts held by states and municipalities are seen to be more sensitive than personal interest bearing transaction accounts 
therefore  of public interest bearing transaction accounts are shown as repricing within three months 
the table does not assume any prepayment of fixed rate loans 
the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities  for example  prepayments of loans and withdrawal of deposits  is beyond the company s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within a stated period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels 
maturing or repricing december  within three months after months but within year after but within years after years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans investment securities interest bearing cash accounts total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities deposits interest bearing demand savings accounts time deposits total interest bearing deposits borrowings fed funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase long term debt subordinated debentures total borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative rate sensitivity gap changes in estimates and assumptions made for interest rate sensitivity modeling and gap analysis could have a significant impact on projected results and conclusions 
therefore  these techniques may not accurately reflect the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income or net portfolio value 
because of the limitations in the gap analysis discussed above  members of the company s asset liability committee believe that the interest sensitivity modeling more accurately reflects the effects and exposure to changes in interest rates 
net interest income simulation considers the relative sensitivities of the balance sheet including the effects of interest rate caps on adjustable rate mortgages and the relatively stable aspects of core deposits 
as such  net interest income simulation is designed to address the probability of interest rate changes and the behavioral response of the balance sheet to those changes 
market value of portfolio equity represents the fair value of the net present value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items 
the starting point or base case for the following table is an estimate of the company s net portfolio value at december  using current discount rates  and an estimate of net interest income for assuming that both interest rates and the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities remain at december  levels 
the information provided for the net portfolio value assumes fluctuations or rate shocks of plus basis points and minus basis points 
rate shocks assume that current interest rates change immediately 
the information provided for net interest income for assumes that changes in interest rates of plus basis points and minus basis points change gradually in equal increments over the twelve month period

the minimum ratio of risk based capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet items  such as standby letters of credit is 
at least half of the total capital is to be comprised of common stock equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill tier i capital 
the remainder tier ii capital may consist of mandatory convertible debt securities  qualifying subordinated debt  other preferred stock and a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the federal reserve board has adopted a similar risk based capital guideline for the company which is computed on a consolidated basis 
in addition  the bank regulators have adopted minimum leverage ratio guidelines tier i capital to average quarterly assets  less goodwill for financial institutions 
these guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of for financial institutions that meet certain specified criteria  including that they have the highest regulatory rating 
all other holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of plus an additional cushion of at least to basis points

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab was issued to provide consistency between how registrants quantify financial statement misstatements 
sab established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatement on each of a company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this approach is commonly referred to as the dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the roll over and iron curtain methods 
the company evaluated the impact that the adoption of sab had on its financial statements using both the iron curtain method and the rollover method to evaluate misstatements and did not find any items requiring an adjustment 
in september  the financial accounting standards board ratified a consensus opinion reached by the emerging issues task force on issue  accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements  eitf which requires employers that enter into endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements that provide an employee with a postretirement benefit to recognize a liability for the future benefits promised based on the substantive agreement made with the employee 
whether the accrual is based on a death benefit or on the future cost of maintaining the insurance would depend on what the employer has effectively agreed to provide during the employee s retirement 
the purchase of an endorsement type life insurance policy does not qualify as a settlement of the liability

during the same time period 
effects of inflation the impact of inflation  as it affects banks  differs substantially from the impact on non financial institutions 
banks have assets which are primarily monetary in nature and which tend to move with inflation 
this is especially true for banks with a high percentage of rate sensitive interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
a bank can further reduce the impact of inflation with proper management of its rate sensitivity gap 
this gap represents the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities 
lakeland attempts to structure its assets and liabilities and manages its gap to protect against substantial changes in interest rate scenarios  in order to minimize the potential effects of inflation
