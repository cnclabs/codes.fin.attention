long term strategies to grow earnings per share our long term strategies with respect to increasing net income and earnings per share include the following expanding our restaurant base 
we will continue to evaluate opportunities to develop texas roadhouse restaurants in existing and new markets

average unit volume represents the average annual restaurant sales for all company restaurants open for a full six months before the beginning of the period measured 
growth in average unit volumes in excess of comparable restaurant sales growth is generally an indication that newer restaurants are operating with sales levels in excess of the system average

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas fin  was issued 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are effective as of the beginning of the company s fiscal year 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
share based employee compensation 
beginning in the first quarter of  we account for share based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
as required by sfas r  share based compensation expense is estimated for equity awards at fair value at the grant date 
we determine the fair value of equity awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including the expected dividend yield  stock price volatility and life of the award 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of share based employee compensation 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of individual restaurants for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
in making these judgments  we consider the period of time since the restaurant was opened and the trend of operations and expectations for future sales growth 
for a restaurant selected for review  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows from operating the restaurant over its estimated useful life 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of each restaurant 
our judgments and estimates related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets are affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long lived assets  these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge 
if assets are determined to be impaired  we would measure the impairment charge by calculating the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
the company recorded an impairment loss in restaurant other operating expenses of million in with respect to two restaurants that were approved to relocate to better sites in their respective markets 
one of these restaurants opened at its new site in january we concluded that no other impairment charge was necessary as a result of our impairment evaluations for  and goodwill 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of impairment consists of two steps 
first  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows 
second  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit  which we consider to be at the restaurant level  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
the most significant assumptions we use in this analysis are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we use the assumptions from our strategic plan for items such as sales growth and operating costs 
if our assumptions used in performing the impairment test prove inaccurate  the fair value of the restaurants may ultimately prove to be significantly lower  thereby causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating impairment has occurred 
we concluded that no impairment charge was required for the years ended december   december  and december  insurance reserves 
we self insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation  general liability and property insurance programs 
we purchase insurance for individual claims that exceed the amounts listed below workers compensation general liability property we record a liability for unresolved claims and for an estimate of incurred but not reported claims at the anticipated cost to us based on estimates provided by a third party administrator and actuary 
our estimated liability is based on a number of assumptions and factors regarding economic conditions  the frequency and severity of claims and claim development history and settlement practices 
estimates of claims reserves are discounted using a discount rate of approximately at december  resulting in a discount of million 
an increase or decrease in the discount rate of basis points would change the reserve  and resulting expense  by an immaterial amount 
we also monitor actuarial observations of historical claim development for the industry 
our assumptions are reviewed  monitored  and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  under which deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
any change in the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
prior to converting to a c corporation on october   the company operated as a limited liability company and was taxed as a partnership 
as such  the company s income or losses were passed through to its owners who are liable for any related income taxes 
effects of inflation we do not believe inflation has had a significant effect on our operations during the past several years as we generally have been able to substantially offset increases in our restaurant and operating costs resulting from inflation by altering our menu  increasing menu prices or making other adjustments 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and changes in commodity prices 
our exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited to our outstanding bank debt 
at december   there was million in outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit  which bears interest at approximately to basis points depending on our leverage ratios over the london interbank offered rate libor 
we had various other notes payable totaling million with fixed interest rates ranging from to 
should interest rates based on these borrowings increase by one percentage point  our estimated annual interest expense would increase by million 
many of the ingredients used in the products sold in our restaurants are commodities that are subject to unpredictable price volatility 
although we attempt to minimize the effect of price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients  there are no established fixed price markets for certain commodities such as produce and cheese and we are subject to prevailing market conditions when purchasing those types of commodities 
for commodities that are purchased under fixed price contracts  the prices are based on prevailing market conditions at the time the contract is entered into and do not fluctuate during the contract period 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices but will continue to evaluate their effectiveness 
extreme and or long term increases in commodity prices could adversely affect our future results  especially if we are unable  primarily due to competitive reasons  to increase menu prices 
additionally  if there is a time lag between the increasing commodity prices and our ability to increase menu prices or  if we believe the commodity price increase to be short in duration and we choose not to pass on the cost increases  our short term financial results could be negatively affected 
we are subject to business risk as our beef supply is highly dependent upon four vendors 
if these vendors were unable to fulfill its obligations under its contracts  we may encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies  any of which would harm our business
