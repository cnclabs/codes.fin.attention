ebitda  a measure used by management to measure performance  is defined as income loss from continuing operations  plus interest expense  net of interest income  income tax expense  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and amortization of coal supply agreements 
our management believes ebitda is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry 
ebitda is not a recognized term under gaap and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
because not all companies use identical calculations  this presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
additionally  ebitda is not intended to be a measure of cash flow available for management s discretionary use  as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as interest payments  tax payments and debt service requirements 
the amounts shown for ebitda as presented herein differ from the amounts calculated under the definition of ebitda used in our debt instruments 
the definition of ebitda used in our debt instruments is further adjusted for certain cash and non cash charges and is used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain payments 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources covenant compliance 
ebitda is calculated and reconciled to income loss from continuing operations in the table below

the amount for the successor in includes the mark to market gain on interest rate swaps not yet designated as cash flow hedges prior to december  in  the amount includes the mark to market loss for the period during which the swaps did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting 
see note above 
b represents the portion of pension  other postretirement and black lung expense resulting from amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses  prior service costs and transition obligations 
c represents incremental cost of sales recorded in the period arising from the preliminary estimate of profit added to inventory in purchase accounting 
d in purchase accounting  the fair value of partially and fully uncovered coal included consideration of the effort spent prior to the purchase date to remove overburden and get the coal to its partially or fully uncovered state 
therefore  the fair value assigned to partially and fully uncovered coal reserves was higher than that assigned to other coal reserves 
depletion of coal reserves  including the incremental fair value related to pre acquisition overburden removal efforts is included in depreciation  depletion and amortization 
subsequent to the acquisition date and prior to the implementation of emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for stripping costs incurred during production in the mining industry on january   the cost associated with removal of overburden to uncover coal reserves was deferred until the related coal is mined and charged to cost of coal sales when the coal is sold 
all partially and fully uncovered coal valued at the acquisition date was sold by december  for the twelve months ended december  and for the period from february  date of formation through december   depreciation  depletion and amortization included the value of overburden removal performed prior to the acquisition date  which would have been included in cost of coal sales if incurred subsequent to the acquisition date 
e represents an accrual for compensation expense attributable to stock options  restricted stock units and restricted stock awarded to certain directors

legal and tax fees associated with these settlements were million in the period january  to july   million in  and million in b represents the cost of a one time bonus awarded to certain employees in connection with the acquisition 
c represents the cost of a long term incentive plan instituted by the predecessor in that was terminated prior to closing as required by the change in control provisions in the plan agreement 
we have implemented a management equity program that will not result in a cash cost to us 
d in  amount represents a million bonus paid to senior management related to the ipo and a million sponsor monitoring fee recorded by the successor 
this latter item was terminated in connection with the ipo 
in  amount represents a loss of longwall shields at the emerald mine due to geological conditions 
represents the estimated impact on ebitda of the temporary idling of our cumberland mine in the first half of as a result of a revised interpretation of mine ventilation laws by msha 
for purposes of this computation  earnings consist of pre tax income from continuing operations excluding minority interest and equity in earnings of affiliates plus fixed charges 
fixed charges consist of interest expense on all indebtedness plus amortization of deferred costs of financing and the interest component of lease rental expense 
earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges by the deficiency of million for the seven months ended july  
table of contents part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview we are the fourth largest coal producer in the united states  operating nine mining complexes that consist of fourteen individual coal mines 
our mining operations are located in southwest pennsylvania  southern west virginia  southern illinois and the southern powder river basin region of wyoming 
four of our operations are surface mines  two of our operations are underground mines using highly efficient longwall mining technology and the remaining eight operations are underground mines that utilize continuous miners 
in addition to mining coal  we also purchase coal from other producers and utilize it with our own production in coal brokering and trading activities 
our primary product is steam coal  sold primarily to electric power generators located in the united states 
approximately of both our and coal sales revenues were made from the sale of metallurgical coal to the domestic and export metallurgical coal markets where it is used to make coke for steel production 
while the majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of coal  we also realize revenues from coal production royalties  override royalty payments from a coal supply agreement now fulfilled by another producer  fees from the processing of our production by a synfuel facility  fees to transload coal through our rivereagle facility on the big sandy river and revenues from the sale of coalbed methane 
from july  through july   we were known as rag american coal holding  inc and were a stand alone wholly owned subsidiary of rag coal international ag rag headquartered in essen  germany 
in october  rag announced its intention to divest its international mining subsidiaries 
in addition to rag american coal holding  inc  these international mining subsidiaries consisted of operations in australia and venezuela 
on february   rag announced the sale of four of our subsidiaries  collectively known as the rag colorado business unit  to a third party 
the subsidiaries comprising the rag colorado business unit owned an underground longwall mine located in routt county  colorado  an idled underground longwall mine located in moffat county  colorado and surface lands located in northwest colorado and southern wyoming 
the transaction closed on april  in the financial statements of the predecessor for the period from january  through july   the rag colorado business unit is classified as a discontinued operation 
on may   rag entered into a definitive agreement with foundation coal corporation to sell all of its remaining operations 
accordingly  foundation coal holdings  inc the company and its indirect wholly owned subsidiary  foundation coal corporation fcc  began operations on july  by acquiring all of the us coal mining operations of rag american coal holding  inc the acquisition  then owned by first reserve fund ix  lp first reserve  blackstone fch capital partners iv lp blackstone  blackstone family investment partnership iv  american metals and coal international acquisition  llc collectively  the sponsors and senior management of the company 
in december    shares of the company s common stock were sold in an initial public offering and partial exercise of the overallotment shares 
these transactions in combination with a stock dividend of  common shares distributed to the pre ipo shareholders in january  reduced the company ownership by the sponsors and management to approximately 
on september   the company completed a secondary offering and partial exercise of the overallotment shares in which the sponsors sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
this transaction reduced the ownership of the company by the sponsors and management to approximately 
on january    shares of common stock of the company were distributed by affiliates of blackstone to blackstone s limited and other partners and  shares of the company s common stock were distributed by first reserve to first reserve s limited and other partners 
the  shares distributed represented all of the remaining shares of the company owned by blackstone and first reserve 

table of contents results of operations basis of presentation due to the change in ownership  and the resultant application of purchase accounting  the historical financial statements of the predecessor and the successor included in this form k have been prepared on different bases for the periods presented and are not comparable 
the following describes the basis of presentation for all periods presented successor represents the consolidated financial position of foundation coal holdings  inc as of december  and and our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the twelve months ended december  and december  and for the period from february date of formation through december  foundation coal holdings  inc had no significant activities until the acquisition of rag american coal holding  inc on july  hereinafter  the period from february date of formation through december  is referred to as the five month operating period ended december  our consolidated financial position at december  and december  and our consolidated results of operations for the twelve months then ended reflect the final purchase price allocation based on appraisals prepared by independent valuation specialists  employee benefit valuations prepared by independent actuaries and other internal analysis 
deferred income taxes have been provided in the consolidated balance sheet based on the tax versus book basis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
during the twelve months ended december   we completed the purchase price allocation  and recorded final purchase accounting adjustments that reduced the fair value of the total assets acquired by approximately million  or approximately  of the preliminary value assigned to the assets acquired 
the most significant component of this decrease related to a revision in deferred income tax liabilities associated with projected postretirement benefit obligations resulting from changes in the assumptions regarding the impact on these obligations of the medicare part d prescription drug benefits 
the reduction in deferred income tax liabilities resulted in corresponding changes to the values assigned to owned and leased mineral rights and coal supply agreements 
the preliminary valuation of deferred income taxes assumed that medicare part d would be coordinated with the company s health care plans 
additional information obtained and analysis performed prior to the finalization of purchase accounting caused this assumption to change whereby the company decided to utilize the income tax free subsidy offered under medicare part d 
our consolidated financial position at december  reflected our preliminary estimates of purchase price allocation before the final purchase accounting adjustments described above 
the application of purchase accounting to the acquired assets of rag american coal holding  inc resulted in increases to owned and leased mineral rights  surface lands  coal inventories  and the asset arising from recognition of asset retirement obligations 
it resulted in decreases to plant and equipment and current deferred taxes 
in addition  the historical cost assigned to deferred overburden in the acquired asset balance sheet was eliminated 
the values assigned to uncovered and partially covered coal lands considered the stage of the mining process in which these two groups of coal lands were at the acquisition date 
the application of purchase accounting to the acquired liabilities of rag american coal holding  inc resulted in increases to postretirement health care obligations  pension obligations  black lung obligations  asset retirement obligations and noncurrent deferred taxes 
separate assets or liabilities were established to reflect the valuation of above or below market coal supply agreements in relation to market price curves 
with regard to consolidated results of operations for the five month operating period ended december  and the twelve months ended december  and  respectively  the principal effects of the application of purchase accounting  in comparison to reporting for historical periods  were to decrease the cost of coal sold due to lower expenses for postretirement health care and pensions  to decrease net amortization expense for coal supply agreements which is now a net credit because our contracts at acquisition represented a net liability and to increase the cost of depletion expense for owned and leased mineral rights 
during the five month operating period ended december   cost of coal sold was increased for the increase in value of coal inventories from cost to market at the acquisition date 
predecessor represents the consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows for rag american coal holding  inc for the period from january  through july  these consolidated financial statements are based on the historical assets  liabilities  sales and expenses of the predecessor for these periods 

table of contents non gaap combined to facilitate trend analysis  in management s discussion and analysis for the successor period twelve months ended december  compared to the predecessor period from january  through july  and the successor period from february  date of formation through december  five month operating period ended december   we discuss non gaap combined results for the twelve months ended december  non gaap combined amounts are determined by adding the historical amounts of the predecessor for the period from january  through july  with the corresponding amounts of the successor for the five month operating period ended december  non gaap combined amounts are not recognized measures under gaap and do not purport to be alternatives to gaap operating measures 
non gaap combined amounts are not indicative of the operating results of foundation coal holdings  inc because of the significant difference in basis between the successor and predecessor caused by the acquisition on july  and its impact on income from operations 
management believes that the discussion of non gaap combined operating results is important to the readers of the financial statements to understand key operating trends over the normal operating cycle years  and non gaap combined amounts are reconciled to the underlying historical gaap basis financial statements on page twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  coal sales realization per ton sold represents the average revenue realized on each ton of coal sold

coal sales revenues in northern appalachia for the twelve months ended december  increased by compared to the coal sales revenues for the twelve months ended december  as a result of an increase in average coal sales realization per ton and a increase in tons sold 
revenue realization per ton sold in northern appalachia increased in due to the substitution of higher priced contracts which took effect in late and early for lower priced contracts that expired offset by lower coal quality premiums 
coal sales volumes in northern appalachia increased by million tons year over year mainly as a result of increased shipments and production from the cumberland mine  partially offset by decreased shipments and production from the emerald mine due to difficult mining conditions experienced throughout the year 
emerald had two scheduled longwall moves during compared to one scheduled longwall move during  the result of which contributed to lower year over year production and sales 
cumberland had one scheduled longwall move in both and coal sales revenues in central appalachia for the twelve months ended december  increased by compared to the coal sales revenues for the twelve months ended december  as a result of an 
table of contents increase in average coal sales realization per ton offset by a decrease in tons sold 
coal sales realization per ton sold in central appalachia increased in due to a combination of a substitution of higher priced contracts which took effect in late and early for lower priced contracts that expired  and b higher coal quality premiums 
coal sales volumes in central appalachia decreased by million tons year over year as a result of decreased shipments and production from all our mining operations with the exception of the pax surface mine and the laurel creek mines 
central appalachia production and shipments were higher in the first quarter of compared to due to shipments of purchased coal utilized on selected steam coal contracts 
however  in the remaining three quarters of the year  overall production was lower in compared to a result of difficult mining conditions experienced throughout the year  resulting in lower shipments and sales volumes 
the pax surface mine  which replaced the simmons fork mine that depleted its reserves in  began production in the fourth quarter of in and pax produced million tons and millions tons  respectively 
year over year production increases at pax occurred as mine development progressed to its current state of completion 
pax is expected to produce at an annual rate of approximately million tons per year before the integration of the recently acquired mining assets of pax south discussed in significant property transactions below 
coal sales revenues in the powder river basin for the twelve months ended december  increased by compared to the coal sales revenues for the twelve months ended december  as a result of a increase in average coal sales realization per ton and a increase in tons sold 
base revenue realization per ton increased by year over year while coal quality premium penalty revenue increased year over year 
coal sales realization per ton increased due to the commencement of shipments under higher priced contracts and higher coal quality premiums 
coal sales volumes in the powder river basin increased by million tons to a record shipment level of million tons primarily due to a increase in both production and shipments from the belle ayr mine where annual production capacity was increased by million tons effective january  eagle butte production and shipments increased year over year primarily due to favorable second and third quarter of operating results 
coal sales revenues in the illinois basin for the twelve months ended december  decreased by compared to the coal sales revenues for the twelve months ended december  as a result of a decrease in tons sold  while average coal sales realization per ton remained consistent between years 
base revenue realization per ton increased slightly year over year while coal quality premium penalty revenue decreased year over year 
coal sales volumes from the illinois basin decreased by million tons  reflecting lower production from the wabash mine due to the diversion of scheduled operating shifts to maintain the mine s underground infrastructure and the mine s compliance with federal and state regulations  coupled with a lower clean coal recovery percentage as compared to the same period in purchased coal activities by our trading group decreased by approximately million tons  compared to the same period in  due to decreased trade activities and the timing of purchased coal transactions 
other revenues for the twelve months ended december  increased by million compared to the twelve months ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased royalty income million and increased miscellaneous revenues from our dry systems technologies subsidiary million

as explained in the revenue section above  the increased revenues resulted from a increase in tons sold from record shipments and a increase in average sales realization per ton 
the increase in tons sold is primarily due to the expansion of annual capacity at the belle ayr mine and favorable second and third quarter of operating results at the eagle butte mine which resulted in a total year over year increase in production and shipments of and  respectively 
increased production costs were primarily in the following areas a royalties  excise taxes and coal production taxes  which respond to changes in coal sales revenues million  b diesel fuel and utilities million  c repairs and maintenance million  d large equipment tires and other operating supplies million  e explosives million  f labor and employee benefits million  g other supplies and services million  and h depreciation and amortization million 
certain production cost increases occurred due to higher year over year production 
there was a year over year million reduction in amortization of coal supply agreements as shipments on a number of supply agreements valued in purchase accounting were completed 
production costs in the twelve months ended december  included a million credit for overburden removal costs added to work in process inventory offset by million in higher cost depletion expense in the prior year mainly relating to depletion of partially and fully uncovered coal established in purchase accounting 
with the implementation of eitf issue  effective january   the powder river basin mines are no longer recognizing work in process inventory for uncovered coal 
cost of coal sales per ton  after adjusting for the impact of the accounting change for overburden removal costs  increased approximately year over year for reasons discussed above 
northern appalachia despite higher revenue of million  income from operations decreased by million year over year due to increased cost of coal sales of offset by million of miscellaneous income 
increased revenues resulted from a increase in tons sold and an increase in average sales realization per ton 
the increase in sales was primarily due to a increase in shipments from the cumberland mine as production in all but the third quarter of increased over quarters as a result of good mining conditions and strong longwall productivity 
the production decline in the third quarter of  compared to  resulted from a scheduled longwall move which shut down longwall mining operations for an approximate two week period during the quarter 
cumberland had a longwall move in the fourth quarter of production from the emerald mine declined year over year  impacted by difficult mining conditions and equipment problems experienced throughout the year which resulted in a decline in shipments 
increased cost of coal sales consisted primarily of million of higher production costs  represented by increases in the

cost of coal sales per ton increased approximately year over year 
central appalachia income from operations decreased by million year over year due to increased cost of coal sales of million  increased depreciation and amortization expense of million  a reduced credit to expense for amortization of coal supply agreements of million and a pre tax charge of million to write down prepaid royalties associated with certain mining leases  partly offset by increased revenues of million and reduced cost depletion expense of million 
the increase in revenues resulted from an increase in average sales realizations per ton resulting from the roll off of lower priced coal sales agreements from tons sold decreased slightly despite increased tons that were purchased and resold and year over year and increases in production and shipments  respectively  at the pax surface mine due to the completion of mine development 
higher cost of coal sales were primarily due to increases in the following areas a labor and fringe benefits million  b materials  supplies and services  led by increases for maintenance and repairs  diesel fuel  explosives and contract trucking million  c purchased coal million  and d royalties and severance taxes million

the successor reported income from continuing operations of million and million  respectively  for the twelve months ended december  and for the five month operating period ended december   whereas the predecessor reported a loss from continuing operations of million for the period from january  through july  during the period from january  through july  the predecessor incurred approximately million  net of income taxes  of non cash charges related to termination of hedge accounting for interest rate swaps  partly offset by a net mark to market gain on the interest rate swaps 
the predecessor also incurred charges for early extinguishment of debt of million  net of income taxes  and a coal contract settlement of million  net of income taxes 
these one time charges total million  net of income taxes 
these charges in combination with below normal coal production from our northern appalachia mines were the primary reason for the significant loss from continuing operations 
during the twelve months ended december   the successor achieved stronger production and tons sold  enjoyed significantly higher per ton sales realizations and received the benefit of a net credit from amortization of coal supply agreements  reflecting amortization of a liability established for below market contracts in purchase accounting 
year over year increases in cost of coal sales  selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation  depletion and amortization were more than absorbed by higher coal sales revenues

coal sales volumes in northern appalachia increased by million tons as a result of increased shipments from both the emerald million tons and cumberland million tons mines 
combined production from the two mines and from cumberland alone set annual records 
coal sales volumes in northern appalachia during were decreased by interruptions to operations caused by a the idling of the cumberland mine longwall for approximately eleven weeks as explained below  b an extended duration longwall move at the emerald mine during the first quarter of  and c adverse mining conditions at emerald during the third quarter of including the extended duration longwall move mentioned above  emerald had two longwall moves in compared with only one in cumberland had one longwall move in each year 
from february through may   the longwall mining equipment at the cumberland mine was idled due to alleged violations resulting from a revised interpretation of regulations issued by msha regarding the ventilation system at the mine 
in response  we revised the ventilation system to minimize any future business disruption and on may  we resumed longwall operations at the cumberland mine 
there were no interruptions of production due to ventilation issues during coal sales volumes in central appalachia increased by million tons due to increased sales of purchased coal in plus higher production at the kingston and pioneer pax mines  which was partly offset by lower production from the laurel creek complex 
production capacity at kingston was expanded in early by the addition of a continuous miner unit 
production from the pioneer pax surface mine complex increased in comparison to as the closure of the simmons fork mine was more than offset by production from the developing pax mine 
the pax mine produced million tons during when fully developed in  it is expected to produce approximately one million tons of coal per year 
coal sales volumes in the powder river basin increased by million tons  to an annual record level of million tons 
a higher level of committed sales was partly offset by worse than expected levels of rail service brought on by unusually inclement weather during may and resultant repairs to the rail lines  particularly the up bnsf joint line south of gillette 
during the second half of  our powder river basin mines shipped at an annualized rate of million tons  approximately equal to our expected total year shipments prior to the disruptions to rail 
table of contents service 
coal sales volumes from the illinois basin increased by million tons reflecting shipments made to fulfill new contract obligations 
purchased coal activities by our trading group decreased by approximately million tons compared to the prior year due to the timing of purchased coal transactions 
coal sales realization per ton sold in northern and central appalachia increased by and  respectively  in due to substitution of higher priced contracts  which took effect in late and during  for lower priced contracts that rolled off 
an additional factor in northern appalachia was higher coal quality premiums for sulfur content as a result of record prices for sulfur dioxide allowances and lower sulfur content of shipped coal 
in the powder river basin  coal sales realizations per ton declined by due to the expiration at the end of of higher priced contracts signed during the market increase  partly offset by higher sulfur premiums 
the weighted average coal sales realization per ton sold of for also benefited from a larger proportion of higher priced northern appalachia and central appalachia tons sold relative to the lower priced tons from the powder river basin 
other revenues for the twelve months ended december  increased by million compared to the non gaap combined other revenues for the twelve months ended december  the increase was partly due to charges totaling million during the period for settlement of future coal sales commitments compared to million of such charges in  combined with higher revenues for synfuel fees million and higher coal bed methane sales and coal bed methane royalties million during the period

depreciation  depletion and amortization includes depreciation of plant and equipment  cost depletion of amounts assigned to coal lands and mining rights and amortization of mine development costs and leasehold improvements 
expense increased in the twelve months ended december  compared to the non gaap combined expense for the year ended december   primarily due to a full year of depreciation  depletion and amortization in of the increased asset values assigned in purchase accounting  as well as depreciation of capital additions made during coal supply agreement amortization 
application of purchase accounting resulted in recognition of a significant liability for below market priced coal supply agreements as well as a significant asset for above market priced coal supply agreements  both in relation to market prices at the acquisition date 
amortization of the liability for below market priced coal supply agreements during the twelve months ended december  and the five month operating period ended december  totaled million and million of credits to expense  respectively 
amortization of the asset for above market priced coal supply agreements during the same periods totaled million and million of charges to expense  respectively

in addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the senior secured credit facility  we will be required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of the unutilized commitments  beginning at a rate equal to per annum of the unused commitment 
based on our leverage ratio as of december   our rate has been reduced to 
we also pay customary letter of credit fees 
the senior secured credit facility requires us to prepay outstanding term loans  subject to certain exceptions  in certain situations 
any mandatory prepayments would be applied to the remaining scheduled installments of the term loan facility on a pro rata basis 
optional prepayments would be applied to the term loan facility at our direction 
if prepaid  there would be a charge for any breakage costs 
at the inception of the facility  we were required to repay installments on the term loans in quarterly principal amounts of million beginning in september  stepping up to million in september  with the remaining balance of million due on the july  maturity date 
because we prepaid million of outstanding principal on december   we are not required to make a quarterly principal payment until march principal amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility will be due and payable in full at maturity  five years from the date of the closing of the senior secured credit facility 
the senior secured credit facility contains a number of covenants that  among other things  restrict  subject to certain exceptions  the ability of certain of our subsidiaries  and the ability of each guarantor under the credit facility to incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  repay other indebtedness including the senior notes  pay dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock  make investments  loans or advances  make certain acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  enter into sale and leaseback transactions and enter into hedging agreements 
financial covenants include an interest coverage ratio test  a leverage ratio test and a limit on capital expenditures 
the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes limits our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on or make other distributions or repurchase our capital stock  make certain investments  limit dividends or other payments by its restricted subsidiaries to us  and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies

foundation coal corporation will have the ability  subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the indenture  to incur additional indebtedness if it meets certain conditions  including having greater than a to fixed charge coverage ratio 
interest rate swaps on september   the company entered into pay fixed  receive variable interest rate swap agreements on a notional amount of million 
these swap agreements essentially converted million of the company s variable rate borrowings under the then existing facility to fixed rate borrowings for a three year period that began on september  the maturity date on the swap agreements is september  the company designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of the variable interest payments and recorded the quarterly changes in the fair value of the instruments in other noncurrent assets with an offsetting unrealized gain  net of tax expense  in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
in connection with the closing of the amended and restated senior secured credit facility  the company terminated the swap agreements 
on the date the company made the decision to terminate the interest rate swaps  the interest rate swaps no longer qualified for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and accordingly  any change in the market value of the interest rate swaps affects net income 
on july   the company monetized the million derivative asset included in other noncurrent assets in the company s consolidated financial statements at june  and recognized a million mark to market loss on the swaps 
the million unrealized gain from the change in the market value of the interest rate swaps recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be recognized into income on a prorated basis over the remaining term of the original interest rate swap agreement through september   in accordance with sfas no

other as a regular part of our business  we review opportunities for  and engage in discussions and negotiations concerning  the acquisition of coal mining assets  including lease by application lba bids  and acquisitions of  or combinations with  coal mining companies 
when we believe that these opportunities are consistent with our growth plans and our acquisition criteria  we will make bids or proposals and or enter into letters of intent and other similar agreements  which may be binding or nonbinding  that are customarily subject to a variety of conditions and usually permit us to terminate the discussions and any related agreements if  among other things  we are not satisfied with the results of our due diligence investigation 
any acquisition opportunities we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness  seek equity capital or both 
there can be no assurance that such additional indebtedness and or equity capital will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
on july   the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program the repurchase program  authorizing the company to repurchase shares of its common stock

covenant compliance fcc is required to comply with certain financial covenants which are considered material terms of the senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing fcc s outstanding senior notes 
information about the financial covenants is material to an investor s understanding of fcc s financial condition and liquidity 
the breach of covenants in the senior secured credit facility that are tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda  as defined below  could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility and the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed due and payable 
any such acceleration would also result in a default 
table of contents under our indenture 
additionally  under the senior secured credit facility and indenture  fcc s ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness  making investments and paying dividends is also tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda 
covenants and required levels as defined by the senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing the outstanding senior notes are covenant level senior secured credit facility minimum adjusted ebitda to cash interest ratio x maximum total debt less unrestricted cash to adjusted ebitda ratio x indenture minimum adjusted ebitda to fixed charge ratio required to incur additional debt pursuant to ratio provisions x the senior secured credit facility requires fcc to maintain an adjusted ebitda to cash interest ratio at a minimum of x and a total debt less unrestricted cash to adjusted ebitda ratio starting at a maximum of x in each case for the most recent twelve month period 
failure to satisfy these ratio requirements would constitute a default by fcc under the senior secured credit facility 
if lenders under the senior secured credit facility fail to waive any such default  repayment obligations under the senior secured credit facility could be accelerated  which would also constitute a default under the indenture 
covenants reflect the definition and levels required by the july  amended and restated senior secured credit facility 
the ability for fcc to incur additional debt and make certain restricted payments under our indenture  subject to specified exceptions  is tied to an adjusted ebitda to fixed charge ratio of at least to adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to exclude non recurring items  non cash items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indenture and the senior secured credit facility 
ebitda  a measure used by management to evaluate its ongoing operations for internal planning and forecasting purposes  is defined as net income loss from operations plus interest expense  net of interest income  income tax expense benefit  depreciation and amortization and charges for early extinguishment of debt 
ebitda is not a financial measure recognized under united states generally accepted accounting principles and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
the amounts shown for ebitda as presented  may differ from amounts calculated and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies 
as of december   fcc was in compliance with all required financial covenants of the july  amended and restated senior secured credit facility 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our significant future contractual obligations by year as of december  after total unaudited  in thousands long term debt cash interest on long term debt cash payments for asset retirement obligations unconditional purchase commitments operating leases total the variable interest rate on debt is  reflecting a libor estimate  based on the five year swap rate effective december   plus a margin of 

table of contents we expect to use cash flows provided by operating activities to invest in the range of million to million in capital expenditures  excluding the lba at the eagle butte mine  during calendar year of which million to million is to maintain production and replace mining equipment 
the additional million to million is expected to be directed toward improvements in productivity and selective expansions of production 
approximately million of expected capital expenditures are included in unconditional purchase commitments shown above 
the remaining unconditional purchase commitments consist of million for purchased coal and million pertaining to forward contracts to purchase diesel fuel and explosives in normal quantities for use at our surface mines 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our defined benefit retirement plans and to pay approximately million of retiree health care benefits  net of medicare part d subsidies  in calendar year we also expect to incur approximately million per year for surety bond premiums and letters of credit fees 
we believe that cash balances plus cash generated by operations will be sufficient to meet these obligations plus fund requirements for working capital and capital expenditures without incurring additional borrowings 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include guarantees  indemnifications and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
however  the underlying obligations that they secure  such as asset retirement obligations  self insured workers compensation liabilities  royalty obligations and certain retiree medical obligations  are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
we are required to provide financial assurance in order to perform the post mining reclamation required by our mining permits  pay our federal production royalties  pay workers compensation claims under self insured workers compensation laws in the various states  pay federal black lung benefits  pay retiree health care benefits to certain retired umwa employees and perform certain other obligations 
in order to provide the required financial assurance  we generally use surety bonds for post mining reclamation and royalty payment obligations and bank letters of credit for self insured workers compensation obligations and umwa retiree health care obligations 
federal black lung benefits are paid from a dedicated trust fund that has sufficient assets to fund these obligations for the next several years 
bank letters of credit are also used to collateralize a portion of the surety bonds 
we had outstanding surety bonds with a total face amount of million as of december   of which million secured reclamation obligations  million secured coal lease obligations  million secured self insured workers compensation obligations and million secured miscellaneous obligations 
in addition  we had million of letters of credit in place for the following purposes million for workers compensation  including collateral for workers compensation bonds  million for umwa retiree health care obligations  million for collateral for reclamation surety bonds  and million for other miscellaneous obligations 
over the last several years  surety bond costs have increased while the market terms under which surety bonds can be obtained have generally become less favorable to all mining companies 
in the event that additional surety bonds become unavailable  we would seek to secure our obligations with letters of credit  cash deposits or other suitable forms of collateral 
certain trends and uncertainties our long term outlook for the coal markets in the united states remains positive 
the energy information administration forecasts that coal demand for electrical power generation will increase at an average annual growth rate of through strong demand for coal and coal based electricity generation in the u 
s 
is being driven by the growing economy  expected weather conditions  high prices for and limited supply of alternative fuels for electricity generation  geopolitical risks for global oil and natural gas resources and the abundant steam coal reserves located within the united states 

table of contents approximately  megawatts of new coal fired electrical generation has been proposed in the united states with the largest percentages of proposed projects located in the midwest and west 
new coal fired generating plants representing capacity of roughly megawatts began operating in with an additional  megawatts scheduled to begin operations in another  megawatts are currently under construction and expected to begin operation by the end of of the remaining  megawatts  proposed plants representing approximately  megawatts are still in the very early stages of development with an additional almost  megawatts in the proposed stage 
but projects representing nearly  megawatts of this total have moved forward to the stage of obtaining permits  power sales agreements and or project financing 
in addition  there is increasing interest in coal gasification and coal liquefaction projects 
the high level of interest in new coal fired electric generating facilities  coal gasification and coal liquefaction is a strong indicator of increasing demand for coal in the united states 
through the first eleven months of  coal based generation of electricity declined from the comparable period of the prior year 
during this eleven month period  cooling degree days declined by and heating degree days declined by compared to the prior year 
lower weather related demand for electricity combined with increased output from nuclear  natural gas and hydro generating plants resulted in decreased demand for coal to generate electricity in the ability of the railroads to ship the demanded quantities of coal improved in in comparison to shipments from the southern powder river basin increased approximately year over year  but still fell short of the service levels required to fully satisfy demand for southern powder river basin coal  including test burns 
the railroads are forecasting to increase deliveries from the southern powder river basin by an additional in the performance of the eastern railroads tends to be more mine specific 
in particular  we are reliant on the norfolk southern ns and csx at our central appalachia operations  and on the mga joint line between the ns and csx at our emerald mine in northern appalachia 
during  the combination of decreased demand for coal to generate electricity and increased coal production and shipments caused stockpiles at electrical generation plants to grow by over compared to the distressed stockpile levels of late as a result  coal prices  particularly in the thinly traded spot markets  declined while production and shipping costs continued to increase driven by high prices for commodities and shortages of skilled miners 
since the fourth quarter of  a number of coal producers in central appalachia have announced plans to reduce high cost production 
coal producers in northern appalachia and the powder river basin have announced deferrals of previously announced mine expansion projects 
these measures are expected to tighten coal supplies which  in combination with continued economic growth and more normal weather patterns  is expected to improve the balance of coal supply and demand which suggests that long term fundamentals of the u 
s 
coal industry remain strong 
our revenues depend on the price at which we are able to sell our coal 
the current pricing environment for us steam coal production is strong in relation to historical pricing levels  but has declined over the last year in response to the factors discussed above 
prices for high quality metallurgical coal  used to manufacture coke for steelmaking  have remained stable in response to increased world wide demand for steel 
as of january   we have committed and priced and  respectively  of the mid points of our targeted production ranges for and in the longer term  decreases in coal prices due to  among other reasons  the supply of domestic and foreign coal  the demand for electricity and the price and availability of alternative fuels for electricity generation could affect our revenues and our ability to generate cash flows 
in addition  our results of operations depend on the cost of coal production 
we continue to experience increased operating costs for fuel and explosives  steel products  tires  health care  wages  salaries  contract coal haulage services and contract labor 
also  historically low interest rates have had a negative impact on expenses related to our actuarially determined employee related liabilities 
we may also experience difficult geologic conditions  unforeseen equipment problems and shortages of critical materials such as tires and explosives that may limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels 
to the 
table of contents extent upward pressure on costs exceed our ability to realize sales increases  or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties  our operating margins would be negatively impacted 
see the forward looking statements listed at the beginning of this item for additional considerations regarding our outlook 
critical accounting estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from the estimates used 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a description of all significant accounting policies 
we believe that of these significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity asset retirement obligations our asset retirement obligations arise from the federal smcra and similar state statutes  which require that mine property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan 
significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse and slurry ponds  reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines and sealing portals at deep mines 
reclamation activities that are performed outside of the normal mining process are accounted for as asset retirement obligations in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we determine the future cash flows necessary to satisfy our reclamation obligations on a mine by mine basis based upon current permit requirements and various estimates and assumptions  including estimates of disturbed acreage  cost estimates and assumptions regarding productivity 
estimates of disturbed acreage are determined based on approved mining plans and related engineering data 
cost estimates are based on historical or third party costs  both of which are stated at fair value 
productivity assumptions are based on historical experience with the equipment that is expected to be utilized in the reclamation activities 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we determine the fair value of our asset retirement obligations 
in order to determine fair value  we must also estimate a discount rate and third party margin 
each is discussed below discount rate sfas no 
requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded at fair value 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we utilize discounted cash flow techniques to estimate the fair value of our obligations 
we base our discount rate on the rates of treasury bonds with maturities similar to expected mine lives adjusted for our credit standing 
third party margin sfas no 
requires the measurement of an obligation to be based on the amount a third party would demand to assume the obligation 
because we plan to perform a significant amount of the reclamation activities with internal resources  a third party margin was added to the estimated costs of performing these activities with internal resources 
this margin was estimated based upon discussion with contractors that perform reclamation activities 
if our cost estimates are accurate  the excess of the recorded obligation over the cost incurred to perform the work will be recorded as a gain at the time that reclamation work is settled 
on at least an annual basis  we review our entire reclamation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes as granted by state authorities  additional costs resulting from accelerated mine closures  and revision to cost estimates and productivity assumptions  in each case to reflect current experience 
at december   we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of million  including amounts reported as current 
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty  we estimate that the aggregate undiscounted cost of final mine closure is approximately million at december  payable through 
table of contents employee benefit plans we have two non contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering certain of our salaried and non union hourly employees 
we also have an unfunded non qualified supplemental executive retirement plan serp covering certain of our senior level salaried employees 
benefits are based on either the employee s compensation prior to retirement or stated amounts for each year of service with us 
funding of these plans is in accordance with the requirements of the erisa  which can be deducted for federal income tax purposes 
for the twelve months ended december   and  we contributed million  million and million  respectively  into the plans 
we account for our defined benefit retirement plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas no 
which requires amounts recognized in the financial statements to be determined on an actuarial basis 
for the twelve months ended december   we recorded pension expense of million 
for the twelve months ended december   we recorded pension expense of million 
for the five month operating period ended december   after applying purchase accounting  we recorded pension expense of approximately million 
for the period from january  through july   we recorded pension expense of million 
the calculation of the net periodic benefits costs pension expense and benefit obligation pension liability associated with our defined benefit pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that we deem to be critical accounting estimates 
these assumptions are used by our independent actuaries to make the underlying calculations 
changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts  and actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is an assumption of the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
we establish the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon historical returns and projected returns on the underlying mix of invested assets 
the pension plan s investment targets are equity private equity  fixed income  absolute return funds and real estate mutual funds 
investments are rebalanced on a periodic basis to stay within these targeted guidelines 
the long term rate of return assumption used to determine pension expense was for the twelve months ended december   and for the twelve months ended december   for the five month operating period ended december  and for the period from january  through july  any difference between the actual experience and the assumed experience is deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss and amortized into the future 
the discount rate represents our estimate of the interest rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled 
assumed discount rates are used in the measurement of the projected  accumulated and vested benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension cost 
in estimating that rate  sfas no 
requires rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the discount rate used to determine pension expense was for the twelve months ended december   for the twelve months ended december   for the five month operating period ended december  and for the period from january  through july  the discount rate was increased to at the september  measurement date 
the differences resulting from actual versus assumed discount rates and returns on plan assets are amortized into pension expense over the remaining average service life of the active plan participants 
a one half percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the net periodic pension cost for the twelve months ended december  by approximately million and decrease the projected benefit obligation at december  by approximately million 
the corresponding effects of a one half of one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would be approximately a million increase in the net periodic pension cost and approximately a million increase in the projected benefit obligation 

table of contents we also currently provide certain postretirement medical and life insurance coverage for eligible employees 
these obligations are unfunded 
covered employees who terminate employment after meeting eligibility requirements are eligible for postretirement coverage for themselves and their dependents 
postretirement medical and life plans for salaried employees and non represented hourly employees are contributory  with retiree contributions adjusted annually  and contain other cost sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance 
the postretirement medical plan for members of the umwa is not contributory 
we account for our other postretirement benefits in accordance with sfas no 
which requires amounts recognized in the financial statements to be determined on an actuarial basis 
for the twelve months ended december   we recorded postretirement benefit expense of million 
for the twelve months ended december   we recorded postretirement benefit expense of approximately million 
in the successor financial statements for the five month operating period ended december   after applying purchase accounting and incorporating medicare part d  we recorded postretirement benefit expense of approximately million 
for the period from january  through july   we recorded postretirement benefit expense of million 
various actuarial assumptions are required to determine the amounts reported as obligations and costs related to the postretirement benefit plan 
the differences resulting from actual experience versus actuarial assumptions are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses and amortized into expense in future periods 
these assumptions include the discount rate and the future medical cost trend rate 
the discount rate assumption reflects the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments and is calculated in the same manner as discussed above for the defined benefit retirement plans 
the discount rate used to calculate the postretirement benefit expense was for the twelve months ended december   for the twelve months ended december   and for the five month operating period ended december  and for the period from january  through july  the discount rate was increased to at the september  measurement date 
a one half percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the postretirement benefit expense for the twelve months ended december  by approximately million and decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december  by approximately million 
the corresponding effects of a one half of one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would be approximately a million increase in the postretirement benefit expense and approximately a million increase in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
the future health care cost trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are expected to increase over the life of the plan 
the health care cost trend rate assumptions are determined primarily based upon our historical rate of change in retiree health care costs 
we have implemented many effective retiree health care cost containment measures that have resulted in actual increases in our retiree health care costs to fall far below the double digit annual increases experienced by many companies and cited in most external studies 
the postretirement expense for the twelve months ended december  and was based on an assumed health care inflationary rate of in and  respectively  decreasing to in  which represents the ultimate health care cost trend rate for the remainder of the plan life 
the postretirement expense for the five month operating period ended december  was based on a health care inflation rate of in decreasing to in the postretirement expense for the period from january  through july  was based on an assumed health care inflation rate of in decreasing to in a one percentage point increase in the assumed ultimate health care cost trend rate would increase the service and interest cost components of the postretirement benefit expense for the twelve months ended december  by million and increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december  by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed ultimate health care cost trend rate would decrease the service and interest cost components of the postretirement benefit expense for the twelve months ended december  by million and decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december  by million 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
at december  we had a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets arising from alternative minimum tax amt credits and a valuation allowance to reduce the value of our net deferred tax asset to an amt tax rate 
the company believes that it will continue to be an amt tax payer for the foreseeable future 
if future taxable income is different than expected or if expected tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated  we may record a change to the valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
mineral rights there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves 
many of these uncertainties are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff and independent third party consultants 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological and mining conditions  historical production from similar areas with similar conditions  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  competing property rights such as surface rights  oil and gas rights  deeper or shallower coal rights and easements  ability to permit specific reserves for a particular type of mining  future operating  development and reclamation costs  and mining technology improvements 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows may vary substantially 
actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to reserves may materially vary from estimates

the company adopted eitf issue on january  eitf issue addresses the accounting for stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine  concluding that these costs are considered variable production costs and under a full absorption costing system are considered a component of inventory to be recognized in cost of coal sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of the inventory 
capitalization of post production stripping costs is appropriate only to the extent inventory exists at the end of a reporting period 
the guidance requires application through recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption  with no charge to current earnings for prior periods 
accordingly  prior period results have not been restated 
at december   stripping costs associated with coal that had not been extracted was million which were classified on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of work in process inventory referred to as deferred overburden 
the effect on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption of eitf issue resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment which reduced opening retained earnings  as of january   by million net of tax of million  thereby removing the million current asset previously classified on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of work in process deferred overburden inventory

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we manage our commodity price risk for coal sales through the use of long term coal supply agreements rather than through the use of derivative instruments 
as of january   we had sales commitments for approximately of our planned production 
as of january   uncommitted and unpriced tonnage was  and of planned production in  and  respectively 
eastern coals account for the majority of uncommitted tonnage as  and of the company s planned eastern production remains uncommitted and unpriced in  and  respectively 
some of the products used in our mining activities  such as diesel fuel  explosives  large equipment tires  steel products and electricity  are subject to price volatility 
through our suppliers  we utilize forward purchase contracts to manage the exposure related to this volatility 
as of december   the company has entered into forward purchase commitments for approximately of the diesel fuel that it expects to consume during calendar year at prices ranging from per gallon for our powder river basin mines to per gallon for our central appalachian mines 
the company has designated these contracts as normal purchase normal sale contracts  and  therefore  they are not deemed to be derivative financial instruments for financial reporting purposes 
during the twelve months ended december  and  the cost of diesel fuel represented approximately and  respectively  of the company s consolidated cost of coal sales 
credit risk our credit risk is primarily with electric power generators and  to a lesser extent  steel producers 
most electric power generators to whom we sell have investment grade credit ratings 
our policy is to independently evaluate each customer s creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor outstanding accounts receivable against established credit limits 
when appropriate as determined by our credit management function  we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers that do not meet our credit standards or whose credit has deteriorated 
these steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral  requiring prepayments for shipments or establishing customer trust accounts held for our benefit in the event of a failure to pay 
interest rate risk our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
we have exposure to changes in interest rates through our bank term loan and our revolving credit facility 
to achieve risk mitigation objectives  we have in the past managed our interest rate exposure through the use of interest rate swaps 
in connection with the july  closing of the amended and restated senior secured credit facility  the company terminated existing swap agreements 
on july   the company monetized a million derivative asset included in other noncurrent assets in the company s consolidated financial statements at june  and recognized a resulting million mark to market loss on the swaps 
the million unrealized gain from the change in the market value of the interest rate swaps recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss will be recognized into income on a prorated basis over the remaining term of the original interest rate swap agreement through september   in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and related amendments 
as we continue to monitor the interest rate environment in concert with our risk mitigation objectives  consideration is being given to future interest rate risk reduction strategies
