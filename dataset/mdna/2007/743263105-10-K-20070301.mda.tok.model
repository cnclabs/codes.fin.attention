management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the progress energy consolidated financial statements 
progress energy introduction our reportable business segments and their primary operations include pec primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in portions of north carolina and south carolina  pef primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in portions of florida  and coal and synthetic fuels primarily engaged in the production and sale of coal based solid synthetic fuels in kentucky and west virginia  the operation of synthetic fuels facilities for third parties in west virginia  and coal terminal services in kentucky and west virginia 
the corporate and other segment is comprised of nonregulated businesses that do not separately meet the requirements as a business segment 
it primarily includes the activities of the parent and progress energy service company  llc pesc  as well as other nonregulated business areas 
strategy we are an integrated energy company  with our primary focus on the end use and wholesale electricity markets 
we operate in retail utility markets in the southeastern united states and in other fuels markets in the eastern united states 
over the last several years we have reduced our business risk by exiting the majority of our nonregulated businesses 
we believe that our two electric utilities  combined with our reduced nonregulated business risk  position us well for long term growth 
we are focused on the following key priorities excelling in the daily fundamentals of our utility business  preparing for future baseload capacity due to high growth in our regulated service territories  further strengthening our financial flexibility and growth  maintaining constructive regulatory relations  and executing our remaining divestiture transactions 
a summary of the significant financial objectives or issues impacting us  the utilities and our remaining nonregulated operations is addressed more fully in the following discussion 
we have several key financial objectives  the first of which is to achieve sustainable earnings growth 
in addition  we seek to continue our track record of dividend growth  as we have increased our dividend for consecutive years  and of the last years 
we also seek to continue our efforts to enhance balance sheet strength and flexibility so that we are positioned to accommodate the significant future growth expected at the utilities 
in the short term  our ability to achieve these objectives will be impacted by  among other things  our ability to manage operation and maintenance o m costs  the successful execution of our remaining divestiture transactions  increased environmental spending requirements  commodity price risk  and the scheduled expiration of the internal revenue code the code section k section k tax credit program for our synthetic fuels business at the end of our long term challenges include continuing our cost management initiatives to mitigate escalating nonfuel and fuel operating costs  effectively managing capital projects  including those for environmental compliance and baseload capacity growth  achieving sufficient earnings growth to sustain our track record of dividend growth  meeting the need for future baseload capacity in our regulated service territories  achieving regulatory stability and investment recovery at the utilities and complying with increasingly stringent environmental standards 
please review item a  risk factors and safe harbor for forward looking statements for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward looking statements made herein 
our ability to meet these financial objectives is largely dependent on the earnings and cash flows of the utilities 
the utilities contributed million of our segment profit and generated substantially all of our consolidated cash flow from operations in partially offsetting the net income contribution provided by the utilities was a loss of million recorded at our coal and synthetic fuels operations  primarily related to the impairment of our synthetic fuels assets  and a loss of million recorded at corporate and other  primarily related to interest expense on holding company debt 
while our synthetic fuels operations have historically provided significant net earnings driven by the section k tax credit program  which is scheduled to expire at the end of  the associated cash flow benefits from synthetic fuels are expected to come in the future when deferred tax credits are ultimately utilized 
the total section k credits that have been generated through december   but not yet utilized  are currently carried forward as deferred tax credits and will provide cash flow benefits when utilized 
at december   the amount of these deferred tax credits was million 
see other matters synthetic fuels tax credits below  note d and item a  risk factors for additional information on our synthetic fuels operations 
our total debt to total capitalization ratio calculated from the consolidated balance sheet is percent at the end of  a decrease from percent at the end of  primarily due to a reduction in total debt with proceeds from asset sales  recovery of storm costs incurred in florida during  fuel cost recovery  operating cash flow and growth in equity from retained earnings and limited ongoing equity issuances 
we expect total capital expenditures for  and to be approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  primarily related to the ongoing utilities operations 
we believe that operating cash flows plus availability under our credit facilities and shelf registration statements will be sufficient to fund our current business plans in the near term 
in the long term  we expect to fund our business plans and any new baseload generation through operating cash flows and a combination of long term debt  preferred stock and common equity  all of which are dependent on our ability to successfully access capital markets 
we may also pursue joint ventures or similar arrangements with third parties in order to share some of the financing and operational risks associated with new baseload generation 
in  the parent s  pec s  and pef s corporate credit ratings of bbb were affirmed and their ratings outlooks were changed to positive from stable by standard poor s s p 
moody s investors service  inc moody s upgraded the parent s outlook to stable from negative and upgraded pec s outlook to positive from stable 
fitch ratings fitch upgraded the senior unsecured credit ratings of the parent bbb  pec a and pef a  changed their ratings outlooks to stable and removed the ratings watch positive 
see credit rating matters and guarantees under future liquidity and capital resources below and item a  risk factors for more information regarding the potential impact on our financial condition and results of operations resulting from a ratings change 
regulated utilities the utilities earnings and operating cash flows are heavily influenced by weather  the economy  demand for electricity related to customer growth  actions of regulatory agencies  cost controls  the timing of recovery of fuel costs  and storm damage 
the utilities operate in the southeastern united states  one of the fastest growing regions of the country  and had a net increase of approximately  customers over the past year 
however  lower industrial sales related mainly to weakness in the textile sector at pec have reduced the rate of revenue growth in recent years 
we do not expect any significant improvement or further degradation in industrial sales in the near term 
these combined factors under normal weather conditions are expected to contribute approximately percent to percent annual retail kilowatt hour kwh sales growth at pec and approximately percent to percent annual retail kwh sales growth at pef through at least the utilities also seek to maintain their regulated wholesale business through targeted contract renewals and origination opportunities 
the utilities must continue to invest significant capital in additional energy conservation and efficiency programs  development and deployment of new energy technologies  and new generation  transmission and distribution facilities to support this load growth 
subject to regulatory approval  these investments are expected to increase the utilities rate base or investment in utility plant  upon which additional return can be realized that creates the basis for long term earnings growth in the utilities 
through  we will meet this load growth at pec through existing resources and at pef through the previously planned combined cycle unit of approximately megawatts mw at pef s hines energy complex in the utilities expect total capital expenditures for  and to be approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively 
the utilities expect to fund their capital requirements primarily through a combination of internally generated funds  long term debt  preferred stock and or contribution of equity from the parent 
meeting the anticipated growth within the utilities service territories will require a balanced approach 
the three main elements of this balanced solution are increasing energy efficiency and investing in the development of new energy resources for the future  modernizing existing plants to produce energy efficiently using state of the art technology  and investing in new generating plants 
we estimate that we will require new baseload generation facilities at both pec and pef by the middle of the next decade and a combined total of approximately  mw of additional capacity by  and we are evaluating the best available options for this generation  including advanced design nuclear and clean coal technologies 
the considerations that will factor into this decision include construction costs  fuel diversity  transmission and site availability  environmental impact  the rate impact to customers and our ability to obtain cost effective financing 
see other matters nuclear matters for additional information 
we are subject to significant air quality regulations passed by the united states environmental protection agency epa in that affect our fossil fuel fired generating facilities  the clean air interstate rule cair  the clean air mercury rule camr  and the clean air visibility rule cavr 
additionally  at pec s coal fired facilities in north carolina  we are subject to the north carolina clean smokestacks act enacted in clean smokestacks act 
including estimated costs for cair  camr  cavr and the clean smokestacks act  we currently estimate that total future capital expenditures for the utilities to comply with current environmental laws and regulations addressing air and water quality  which are eligible for regulatory recovery through either base rates or pass through clauses  could be in excess of billion each at pec and pef  respectively  through  which is the latest compliance target date for current air and water quality regulations 
while the utilities expect retail sales growth in the future  they are facing  and expect to continue to face  rising costs 
the utilities are committed to continuing to effectively manage costs to minimize the expected growth in o m expenses 
the utilities are allowed to recover prudently incurred fuel costs through the fuel portion of our rates  which are adjusted annually in each state 
we are focused on mitigating the impact of rising fuel prices since the under recovery of fuel costs impacts our cash flows  interest and leverage  and rising fuel costs and higher rates also impact customer satisfaction 
our efforts to mitigate these high fuel costs include our diverse generation mix  staggered fuel contracts and hedging  and supplier and transportation diversity 
the utilities successfully resolved key state regulatory issues in  including fuel recovery filings in south carolina  north carolina and florida and storm cost reserve replenishment in florida 
the utilities continue to monitor progress toward a more competitive environment 
no retail electric restructuring legislation has been introduced in the jurisdictions in which pec and pef operate 
as part of the clean smokestacks act  pec is operating under a base rate freeze in north carolina through as a result of its base rate proceeding  pef s base rate settlement extends through see note for further discussion of the utilities retail rates 
nonregulated businesses our primary nonregulated businesses are coal and synthetic fuels 
earnings of coal and synthetic fuels are impacted largely by the volume of synthetic fuels produced and tax credits generated  and volumes and prices of coal terminal sales 
through our subsidiaries  we are a majority owner in five entities and a minority owner in one entity  all of which own facilities that produce coal based solid synthetic fuels as defined under section k of the code 
the production and sale of these products qualifies for federal income tax credits so long as certain requirements are satisfied  including a requirement that the synthetic fuels differ significantly in chemical composition from the coal used to produce such synthetic fuels and that the fuel was produced from a facility that was placed in service before july  although the section k tax credit program is expected to continue through  recent market conditions  world events and catastrophic weather events have increased the volatility and level of oil prices that could limit the amount of those credits or eliminate them entirely for this possibility is due to a provision of section k that provides that if annual average market prices for crude oil exceed certain prices  the amount of tax credits is reduced for that year 
in january  we entered into derivative contracts to hedge economically a portion of our synthetic fuels cash flow exposure to the risk of rising oil prices 
the notional quantity of these oil price hedge instruments is million barrels and will provide protection for the equivalent of approximately eight million tons of synthetic fuels production 
the contracts will be marked to market with changes in fair value recorded through earnings 
our synthetic fuels production levels for remain uncertain because we cannot predict with any certainty the price of oil for we will continue to monitor the environment surrounding synthetic fuels production and will adjust our production or consider other alternatives as warranted by changing conditions

as discussed more fully in note and results of operations discontinued operations  in accordance with our business strategy to reduce our business risk and to focus on the core operations of the utilities  many of our nonregulated business operations have been divested or are in the process of being divested 
consequently  we no longer report a progress ventures segment  and the composition of other continuing segments has been impacted by these divestitures 
these operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
as of december   the carrying value of long lived assets of the remaining nonregulated electric generation operations and energy marketing activities and the remaining coal mining operations and other fuels businesses was million 
the progress registrants are subject to various risks 
for a discussion of their current material risks  see item a  risk factors 
results of operations in this section  earnings and the factors affecting earnings are discussed 
the discussion begins with a summarized overview of our consolidated earnings  which is followed by a more detailed discussion and analysis by business segment 
overview for as compared to and as compared to for the year ended december   our net income was million or per share compared to million or per share for the same period in for the year ended december   our income from continuing operations was million compared to million for the same period in the decrease in income from continuing operations as compared to prior year was due primarily to lower synthetic fuels earnings primarily due to lower tax credits  impairment of all of our synthetic fuels assets and a portion of our coal terminal assets  primarily due to high oil prices  unfavorable weather at the utilities  the cost incurred to redeem holding company debt  unrealized losses recorded on contingent value obligations  increased nuclear outage expenses at pec  and the prior year gain on the sale of our utility distribution assets serving the city of winter park  fla 
winter park 
partially offsetting these items were prior year postretirement and severance expenses related to the cost management initiative  increased retail growth and usage at the utilities  the gain on sale of level communications  inc level stock acquired as part of the divestiture of progress telecom  llc pt llc  and the prior year write off of unrecoverable storm costs at pef 
for the year ended december   our net income was million or per share compared to million or per share for the same period in for the year ended december   our income from continuing operations was million compared to million for the same period in the increase in income from continuing operations as compared to prior year was due primarily to increased synthetic fuels earnings  customer growth at the utilities  favorable weather at the utilities  increased wholesale sales at the utilities  and the gain recorded on the sale of winter park utility distribution assets 
partially offsetting these items were postretirement and severance charges related to the cost management initiative  the change in accounting estimates for certain capital costs in our distribution operations energy delivery  and the write off of unrecoverable storm costs at pef 
our segments contributed the following profit or loss from continuing operations in millions change change pec pef coal and synthetic fuels total segment profit corporate and other total income from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of tax cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles net income cost management initiative on february   we approved a workforce restructuring that resulted in a reduction of approximately positions 
in addition to the workforce restructuring  the cost management initiative included a voluntary enhanced retirement program 
in connection with this initiative  we incurred approximately million of pre tax charges for severance and postretirement benefits during the year ended december  we did not incur any similar charges during the severance and postretirement charges are primarily included in o m expense on the consolidated statements of income and will be paid over time 
progress energy carolinas pec contributed segment profits of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in profits for as compared to is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of weather  higher o m expense related to nuclear outages  the impact of suspending the allocation of the parent s income tax benefit not related to acquisition interest expense and capital project write offs 
see corporate and other below for additional information on the change in the tax benefit allocation in these were partially offset by postretirement and severance expenses incurred in related to the cost management initiative and increased retail customer growth and usage 
the increase in profits for as compared to is primarily due to increased revenue from retail customer growth  the favorable impact of weather  increased wholesale margins primarily due to an increase in excess generation revenues and lower depreciation and amortization expense 
these were partially offset by higher o m charges primarily due to postretirement and severance charges related to the cost management initiative and an increase in expenses charged to other  net 
revenues pec s electric revenues and the percentage change by year and by customer class were as follows in millions customer class change change residential commercial industrial governmental total retail revenues wholesale unbilled miscellaneous total electric revenues less fuel revenues revenues excluding fuel pec s electric energy sales and the percentage change by year and by customer class were as follows in thousands of mwh customer class change change residential commercial industrial governmental total retail energy sales wholesale unbilled total mwh sales pec s revenues  excluding fuel revenues of billion and billion for and  respectively  decreased million 
the decrease in revenues was due primarily to the million unfavorable impact of weather partially offset by a million increase in retail customer growth and usage 
weather had an unfavorable impact as cooling degree days were percent below and heating degree days were percent below the increase in retail customer growth and usage was driven by an approximate increase in the average number of customers of  as of december   compared to december  although the change in wholesale revenue less fuel did not have a material impact on the change in revenues  wholesale electric energy sales were down percent primarily due to lower excess generation sales in compared to  partially offset by an increase in contracted wholesale capacity 
the decrease in excess generation sales in compared to is due to favorable market conditions during that resulted in strong sales to the mid atlantic united states 
pec s revenues  excluding fuel revenues of billion and million for and  respectively  increased million 
the increase in revenues was primarily due to increased retail revenues of million as a result of favorable weather  with cooling degree days percent above prior year 
retail customer growth contributed an additional million in revenues in pec s retail customer base increased as approximately  net new customers were added during wholesale revenues  excluding fuel revenues  increased million when compared to million in the increase in pec s wholesale revenues in from is primarily the result of increased excess generation sales 
revenues for included strong sales to the mid atlantic united states as a result of favorable market conditions 
in addition  higher contracted capacity compared to further increased wholesale revenues 
industrial electric energy sales decreased in compared to primarily due to continued reduction in textile manufacturing in the carolinas as a result of global competition and domestic consolidation 
industrial electric energy sales decreased in when compared to primarily due to the reduction in textile manufacturing in the carolinas and lower demand for both pulp and paper products 
the increase in industrial revenues for compared to and compared to is due to an increase in fuel revenues as a result of higher energy costs and the recovery of prior year fuel costs 
expenses fuel and purchased power fuel and purchased power costs represent the costs of generation  which include fuel purchases for generation  as well as energy purchased in the market to meet customer load 
fuel and a portion of purchased power expenses are recovered primarily through cost recovery clauses  and  as such  changes in these expenses do not have a material impact on earnings 
the difference between fuel and purchased power costs incurred and associated fuel revenues that are subject to recovery is deferred for future collection from or refund to customers 
fuel and purchased power expenses were billion for  which represents a million increase compared to fuel used in electric generation increased million to billion compared to this increase is due to a million increase in deferred fuel expense partially offset by a million decrease in fuel used in generation 
deferred fuel expense increased as a result of an increase in north carolina and south carolina fuel recovery rates 
fuel used in generation decreased primarily due to lower system requirements 
see electric pec fuel and purchased power in item  business for a summary of average fuel costs 
purchased power expenses decreased million to million compared to prior year 
the decrease in purchased power is due primarily to a change in volume as a result of lower system requirements 
fuel and purchased power expenses were billion for  which represents a million increase compared to fuel used in electric generation increased million to billion compared to this increase was due to a million increase in fuel used in generation due to higher fuel costs  a change in generation mix and increased volume 
higher fuel costs were driven primarily by an increase in coal and natural gas prices 
outages at several facilities during resulted in increased combustion turbine generation  which had a higher average fuel cost 
the increase in fuel used in generation was offset by a reduction in deferred fuel expense as a result of the under recovery of fuel costs 
purchased power expenses increased million to million compared to the increase in purchased power was due primarily to a change in volume partially offset by a decrease in price 
operation and maintenance o m expenses were million for  which represents an million decrease compared to this decrease is driven primarily by the million impact of postretirement and severance expenses incurred in related to the cost management initiative partially offset by million of higher outage expenses at nuclear plants and capital project write offs of million in o m expenses were million for  which represents a million increase compared to this increase was driven primarily by postretirement and severance expenses related to the cost management initiative 
postretirement and severance expenses related to the cost management initiative increased o m expenses by million during this increase included million of charges in compared to expenses  which included million related to a separate initiative 
in addition  o m expenses increased million related to the change in accounting estimates for certain energy delivery capital costs  million for higher emission allowance expenses  million related to pension expenses and million related to hurricane ophelia storm restoration costs in these unfavorable items were partially offset by decreased plant outage costs of million compared to  which included an additional nuclear plant outage  million of lower health and life benefit expenses and a million reduction of surplus inventory expense

we recorded million of clean smokestacks act amortization during compared to million in depreciation and amortization expense was million for  which represents a million decrease compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to the clean smokestacks act amortization decrease of million to million in compared to amortization of million in this was partially offset by higher depreciation expense of million for increases in the depreciable asset base 
taxes other than on income taxes other than on income were million for  which represents a million increase compared to this increase is primarily due to a million increase in property taxes and a million increase in gross receipts taxes related to higher revenue 
gross receipts taxes are collected from customers and recorded as revenues and then remitted to the applicable taxing authority 
therefore  these taxes have no material impact on earnings 
taxes other than on income were million for  which represents a million increase compared to primarily due to higher payroll taxes of million 
other other operating expenses consisted of a gain of million in compared to a gain of million in  and a gain of million in the decrease in the gain is primarily due to fewer land sales 
total other income expense total other income expense was million of income for  which represents a million increase compared to this increase is primarily due to the million impact of reclassifying million of indemnification liability expenses incurred in for estimated capital costs associated with the clean smokestacks act expected to be incurred in excess of the maximum billable costs to the joint owner 
this expense was reclassified to clean smokestacks act amortization and had no impact on earnings see note b

the increase in revenues is due to increased retail customer growth and usage of million and a million increase in rental and other miscellaneous service revenues partially offset by a million unfavorable impact of weather 
the increase in retail customer growth and usage was driven by an approximate increase in the average number of customers of  as of december   compared to december  the weather impact is primarily due to a percent decrease in heating degree days compared to pef s revenues  excluding fuel and other pass through revenues of billion and billion for and  respectively  increased million 
the increase in revenues was due in part to favorable weather in of million with cooling degree days percent higher than retail customer growth contributed an additional million as the approximate average number of customers increased  as of december   compared to  and there was a significant reduction in hurricane related customer outages compared to this growth in retail revenues was offset by lower retail revenues of million in the winter park area due to the sale of the related distribution system in and an million decline in average use per customer 
wholesale revenues net of fuel increased million attributed to new contracts  including the service to winter park resulting from the switching of the sales to these customers from retail to wholesale 
revenues were also favorably impacted by a reduction in the provision for revenue sharing of million and higher miscellaneous revenues of million 
expenses fuel and purchased power fuel and purchased power costs represent the costs of generation  which include fuel purchased for generation  as well as energy and capacity purchased in the market to meet customer load 
fuel  purchased power and capacity expenses are recovered primarily through cost recovery clauses  and  as such  changes in these expenses do not have a material impact on earnings 
the difference between fuel and purchased power costs incurred and associated fuel revenues that are subject to recovery is deferred for future collection from or refund to customers 
fuel and purchased power expenses were billion in  which represents a million increase compared to fuel used in electric generation increased million due to a million increase in deferred fuel expense resulting from an increase in the fuel recovery rates on january  this was partially offset by a million decrease in current year fuel costs due primarily to lower system requirements 
see electric pef fuel and purchased power in item  business for a summary of average fuel costs 
purchased power expense increased million primarily due to a million increase in current year purchased power costs resulting from higher market prices and a million increase in the recovery of deferred capacity costs 
fuel and purchased power expenses were billion in  which represents a million increase compared to this increase was due to increases in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power expenses of million and million  respectively 
higher system requirements and increased fuel costs in accounted for million of the increase in fuel used in electric generation 
the increase in fuel used in generation was offset by a reduction in deferred fuel expense as a result of the under recovery of fuel costs 
purchased power increased primarily due to higher prices of purchases in as a result of increased fuel costs 
operation and maintenance o m expenses were million in  which represents a million decrease compared to the decrease is primarily due to a million impact of postretirement and severance costs associated with the cost management initiative in  million of lower environmental cost recovery expenses due to a decrease in emission allowances and lower recovery rates  million related to the write off of unrecoverable storm restoration costs see note c  a million decrease in nuclear outage costs and a million impact related to the write off of gridflorida regional transmission organization rto startup costs that were previously recovered in revenues 
the environmental cost recovery expenses are recovered through an environmental cost recovery clause and  therefore  have no material impact on earnings 
o m expenses were million in  which represents a million increase when compared to postretirement and severance costs associated with the cost management initiative increased o m costs by million during in addition  pef wrote off million of unrecoverable storm costs associated with the hurricanes see note c 
o m expense also increased million primarily related to the change in accounting estimates for certain energy delivery capital costs and increased million due to higher environmental cost recovery expenses primarily emission allowances 
the remaining increase in o m expense is attributable to million of expenses related to outages in  an million workers compensation benefit adjustment recorded in  million related to the write off of gridflorida rto startup costs that were previously recovered  and million of additional bad debt expense 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million for  which represents an increase of million compared to  primarily due to a million increase in the amortization of storm restoration costs see note c and a million increase in utility plant depreciation partially offset by a million decrease in expenses related to cost of removal primarily due to rate changes resulting from the depreciation study effective january  see note d 
storm restoration cost amortization is recovered in revenues through the storm recovery surcharge and  therefore  has no material impact on earnings 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for  which represents an increase of million compared to primarily due to the amortization of million in storm restoration costs that began in august see note c 
taxes other than on income taxes other than on income were million in  which represents an increase of million compared to this increase is primarily due to million of higher gross receipts taxes and million of higher franchise taxes  related to an increase in revenues  partially offset by lower payroll taxes 
gross receipts and franchise taxes are collected from customers and recorded as revenues and then remitted to the applicable taxing authority 
therefore  these taxes have no material impact on earnings

coal and synthetic fuels the operations of the coal and synthetic fuels segment include synthetic fuels production and coal terminal operations 
the following summarizes the coal and synthetic fuels segment profits in millions synthetic fuels operations coal terminals and marketing corporate overhead and other operations segment loss profits synthetic fuels operations the production and sale of synthetic fuels generate operating losses  but qualify for tax credits under section k  which generally more than offset the effect of such losses see other matters synthetic fuels tax credits below 
results from the synthetic fuels operations are summarized below in millions tons sold after tax losses excluding impairment charge  valuation allowance and tax credits after tax gain on sale of assets after tax impairment charge net operating loss nol valuation allowance tax credits generated tax credit inflation adjustment tax credit reserve increase due to estimated phase out tax credits previously unrecorded net loss profit prior to  our synthetic fuels production levels and the amount of tax credits we could claim each year were limited by our consolidated regular federal income tax liability 
with the redesignation of section tax credits as section k general business credits  that limitation was removed effective january  synthetic fuels operations net loss profit changed from a profit of million in to a loss of million in primarily due to lower synthetic fuels production as a result of high oil prices  which increased the potential phase out of tax credits 
the million ton decrease in synthetic fuels production resulted in million of lower after tax losses 
the decision to idle our synthetic fuels facilities necessitated an impairment test and resulted in the impairment of our synthetic fuels assets see notes and 
the lower production also resulted in a million reduction in generated tax credits  and as a result of the high oil prices  we recorded a million tax credit reserve due to the estimated phase out 
the higher average oil prices and the uncertainty of the final phase out percentage for resulted in a million after tax decrease in our gain on sale of assets due to recognizing a lower gain on the monetization of the colona synfuel limited partnership  lllp colona facility compared to see note j 
the gain for is expected to be recorded in when the final phase out percentage has been calculated 
as of december   million of deferred gain was recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  results were unfavorably impacted by the recognition of a valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets for state operating loss carry forwards 
due to the impairment of our synthetic fuels assets  the impairment charge included approximately million of depreciation and amortization expense that would otherwise have been recorded in  and million of depreciation and amortization expense that would otherwise have been recorded during synthetic fuels operations net loss profits increased in as compared to due primarily to an increase in synthetic fuels production and an additional million pre tax gain recognized on the monetization of the colona facility compared to see note j  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 
in addition  earnings in include a million favorable tax credit true up related to our total synthetic fuels production of approximately million tons in is greater than production levels of approximately eight million tons as a result of hurricane costs in  which reduced our projected regular tax liability and our corresponding ability to record tax credits from synthetic fuels production 
our future synthetic fuels production levels for remain uncertain due to the recent volatility of oil prices 
see other matters synthetic fuels tax credits below for additional information on the impact of oil prices on section k tax credits  the results of our interim impairment review and a discussion of uncertainties surrounding our synthetic fuels production in coal terminals and marketing coal terminals and marketing coal operations blend and transload coal as part of the trucking  rail and barge network for coal delivery 
this business also has an operating fee agreement with our synthetic fuels operations for procuring and processing of coal and the transloading and marketing of synthetic fuels 
as a result of the relationship with the synthetic fuels operations  fluctuations in coal s annual earnings are primarily related to production volumes at our synthetic fuels facilities 
coal operations contributed earnings of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
coal s results were negatively impacted by the impairment of a portion of coal s terminal assets  which resulted in a pre tax charge of million million after tax and lower revenues related to lower production at our synthetic fuels facilities and higher cost of sales due to higher coal prices see note 
these were partially offset by an million pre tax reduction in expense related to a restructured coal supply contract due to coal commitments that were not delivered 
during the first quarter of  one of coal s supply contracts was restructured resulting in a payment of million to coal 
these proceeds covered long term coal supply commitments from through and will be recognized over the life of the contract as coal is received and the related inventory is utilized 
future amortization of these proceeds will be wholly offset by the increased contract price and is therefore not expected to materially impact earnings 
as a result of the impairment of coal s terminal assets discussed above  the impairment charge included approximately million of depreciation expense that would otherwise have been recorded in and approximately million of depreciation expense that would otherwise have been recorded during the coal and synthetic fuels segment has long term fixed price coal purchase contracts to provide a portion of the feedstock coal required to meet solid synthetic fuels production or to resell as coal 
as a result  the decline in coal prices is expected to negatively impact the financial performance of the coal and synthetic fuels segment compared to previous years 
the increase in earnings for compared to was primarily due to additional revenues at the coal terminals related to increased prices and volumes and additional intersegment fees for both the coal terminals and marketing operations due to increased synthetic fuels production 
these were partially offset by an increase in the cost of coal purchased by the coal terminals operations due to increased prices and larger volumes and lower third party sales by the marketing operations 
corporate overhead and other operations corporate overhead and other operations incurred losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in losses for compared to is primarily due to the decreased allocation of interest and overheads to discontinued operations as a result of the divestitures completed during corporate and other the corporate and other segment consists of the operations of the parent  pesc and other consolidating and nonoperating entities corporate 
corporate and other also includes other nonregulated business areas 
corporate and other income expense is summarized below in millions change change other interest expense contingent value obligations tax reallocation other income tax benefit other expense corporate and other after tax expense other interest expense  which includes elimination entries  increased million for compared to primarily due to a decrease in the interest allocated to discontinued operations and a decrease in the elimination of intercompany interest expense due to lower intercompany debt balances partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower holding company debt 
the decrease in interest expense allocated to discontinued operations resulted from the full year allocations of interest expense in compared to partial year allocations of interest in for operations that were sold in the decrease in other interest expense for compared to is primarily due to the increase in the interest allocated to discontinued operations partially offset by a decrease in interest rate swap activity that benefited from lower variable rates during progress energy issued million contingent value obligations cvos in connection with the acquisition of florida progress corporation florida progress in each cvo represents the right of the holder to receive contingent payments based on the performance of four synthetic fuels facilities owned by progress energy 
the payments  if any  are based on the net after tax cash flows the facilities generate 
at december   and  the cvos had a fair market value of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
progress energy recorded an unrealized loss of million for and unrealized gains of million and million for and  respectively  to record the changes in fair value of cvos  which had average unit prices of  and at december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   income tax expense was not increased by the allocation of the parent s income tax benefits not related to acquisition interest expense to profitable subsidiaries 
due to the repeal of the public utility holding company act of  as amended puhca  beginning in we no longer allocate the parent income tax benefits not related to acquisition interest expense to profitable subsidiaries 
since  parent income tax benefits not related to acquisition interest expense were allocated to profitable subsidiaries  in accordance with a puhca order 
for the years ended december  and  income tax expense was increased by million and million  respectively  due to the allocation of the parent s income tax benefit 
other income tax benefit increased for compared to primarily due to increased pre tax expense at the parent 
other income tax benefit decreased for compared to due primarily to lower pre tax expense at the parent 
for  other expense was million compared to million in the million change is primarily due to the million pre tax million after tax loss on redemption of holding company debt see note partially offset by the million pre tax gain  net of minority interest  on the sale of level stock subsequent to the sale of pt llc see note d 
in addition  other expense changed due to a million increase in interest income on temporary investments due to proceeds from the sale of desoto county generating co  llc desoto  rowan county power  llc rowan and gas 
the million decrease in other expense from to was primarily due to the million pre tax million after tax settlement agreement in that our subsidiary strategic resource solutions corp 
reached with the san francisco united school district related to civil proceedings 
discontinued operations over the last several years we have reduced our business risk by exiting the majority of our nonregulated businesses 
we divested  or announced divestitures  of multiple nonregulated businesses during in accordance with our business strategy to reduce our business risk and to focus on the core operations of the utilities 
consequently  we no longer report a progress ventures segment  and the composition of other continuing segments has been impacted by these divestitures 
cco operations cco georgia operations on december   our board of directors approved a plan to pursue the disposition of substantially all of progress energy ventures  inc s pvi competitive commercial operations cco physical and commercial assets  which include approximately  megawatts of power generation facilities in georgia  as well as forward gas and power contracts  gas transportation  storage and structured power and other contracts  including full requirement contracts with georgia electric membership cooperatives the georgia contracts 
we expect to complete the disposition plan in as a result of the disposition plan  we recorded an after tax estimated loss on the sale of million in december  which includes an impairment charge related to the generation assets and intangible assets to reduce the carrying value of the assets that are expected to be sold to their estimated fair value less cost to sell see note a 
in  we anticipate recording additional material charges in discontinued operations related to the disposition plan 
these additional charges relate primarily to costs to be incurred to exit the georgia contracts 
these costs could exceed million after tax 
if cco divests of its generation facilities but not the georgia contracts  cco will continue to fulfill the contractual obligation through tolling agreements or purchases in the spot market 
due to the reclassification of the remaining cco operations to discontinued operations in december  management determined that it was no longer probable that the forecasted transactions underlying certain derivative contracts covering approximately billion cubic feet bcf of natural gas would be fulfilled 
therefore  these contracts were no longer treated as hedges and were dedesignated  and cash flow hedge accounting was discontinued 
changes in market prices since inception resulted in the recognition of unrealized mark to market gains of million pre tax million after tax for future price volatility in the natural gas market will cause us to record mark to market changes through earnings of discontinued operations and will increase the volatility of future cco operating results 
cco s operations generated net losses from discontinued operations of million in  million in and million in the increase in loss for compared to is primarily due to the million pre tax impairment loss million after tax on goodwill recognized in the first quarter of see note and an increase in realized mark to market losses on gas hedges due to gas price volatility 
this was partially offset by a higher gross margin related to serving the fixed price full requirements contracts that began in april and serving an increased load on a pre existing contract in georgia  and million pre tax of unrealized mark to market gains  primarily related to the dedesignated natural gas hedges discussed above 
the increase in loss for compared to is due primarily to a reduction in gross margin of million pre tax million after tax partially offset by favorable amortization and interest expense fluctuations 
contract margins were unfavorable in compared to due to the expiration of certain above market tolling agreements and decreased earnings from new and existing full requirements contracts due to higher fuel and purchased power costs partially offset by net realized and unrealized mark to market gains 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million pre tax million after tax as a result of the expiration of certain acquired contracts that were subject to amortization 
cco desoto and rowan generation facilities on may   our board of directors approved a plan to divest of our desoto and rowan subsidiaries 
desoto and rowan were subsidiaries of progress energy ventures  inc desoto owns a mw dual fuel combustion turbine electric generation facility in desoto county  fla  and rowan owns a mw dual fuel combined cycle and combustion turbine electric generation facility in rowan county  nc on may   we entered into definitive agreements to sell desoto and rowan  including certain existing power supply contracts  to southern power company  a subsidiary of southern company  for a gross purchase price of approximately million and million  respectively 
we used the proceeds from the sales to reduce debt and for other corporate purposes see note c 
the sale of desoto closed in the second quarter of and the sale of rowan closed during the third quarter of we recorded an after tax loss of million during the year ended december   on the sale of desoto and rowan 
discontinued desoto and rowan operations had combined earnings of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
gas operations on july   our board of directors approved a plan to divest of our natural gas drilling and production business gas  which includes winchester production company  ltd 
winchester production  westchester gas company  texas gas gathering and talco midstream assets ltd  all are subsidiaries of progress fuels corporation progress fuels 
on july   we entered into a definitive agreement to sell gas to exco resources  inc for billion in gross cash proceeds 
we recorded an after tax gain of million during the year ended december   on the sale of gas 
proceeds from the sale were used primarily to reduce holding company debt and for other corporate purposes see note b 
the transaction closed on october  specific assets included over bcf equivalent of proved natural gas reserves  over miles of pipelines  over producing wells and other related assets  all of which were located in texas and louisiana 
discontinued gas operations had net earnings from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december   compared to net earnings from discontinued operations of million for the same period in the increase in net earnings is primarily due to increased production  higher market prices and mark to market gains on gas hedges 
gas operations generated profits of million for the same period in compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the gain recognized on the sale of gas assets in in december  we sold certain gas producing properties and related assets owned by winchester production north texas gas operations 
because the sale significantly altered the ongoing relationship between capitalized costs and remaining proved reserves  under the full cost method of accounting the pre tax gain of million million net of taxes was recognized in earnings rather than as a reduction of the basis of our remaining oil and gas properties 
in addition  lower sales and general and administrative expense and interest expenses partially offset by lower revenues reduced the overall earnings decline from to revenues were lower in due to the sale of the north texas gas operations  however  the texas louisiana gas operations were able to offset a majority of the lost revenue due to higher natural gas prices and increased production 
progress telecom  llc on march   we completed the sale of pt llc to level we received gross proceeds comprised of cash of million and approximately million shares of level common stock valued at an estimated million on the date of the sale 
our net proceeds from the sale of million  after consideration of minority interest  were used to reduce debt 
prior to the sale  we had a percent interest in pt llc see note d 
based on the net proceeds associated with the sale and after consideration of minority interest  we recorded an estimated after tax gain on disposal of million during the year ended december  net loss earnings from discontinued operations for pt llc were a loss of million  earnings of million and a loss of million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
dixie fuels and other fuels business on march   we sold our percent interest in dixie fuels limited dixie fuels to kirby corporation for million in cash 
dixie fuels operates a fleet of four ocean going dry bulk barge and tugboat units under long term contracts with pef 
dixie fuels primarily transports coal from the lower mississippi river to progress energy s crystal river facility 
we recorded an after tax gain of million on the sale of dixie fuels 
the other fuels business is expected to be sold in see note e 
net earnings from discontinued operations for dixie fuels and other fuels business were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
coal mining businesses on november   our board of directors approved a plan to divest of five subsidiaries of progress fuels engaged in the coal mining business 
on may   we sold certain net assets of three of our coal mining businesses to alpha natural resources  llc for gross proceeds of million plus a million working capital adjustment 
as a result  during the year ended december   we recorded an estimated after tax loss of million for the sale of these assets 
the remaining coal mining operations are expected to be sold in see note f 
net losses from discontinued operations for the coal mining business were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
progress rail on march   we completed the sale of progress rail services corporation progress rail to one equity partners llc  a private equity firm unit of jp morgan chase co 
cash proceeds from the sale were approximately million  consisting of million base proceeds plus a working capital adjustment 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded an estimated after tax loss for the sale of these assets of million and million  respectively 
proceeds from the sale were used to reduce debt see note g 
net earnings from discontinued operations for rail were million and million for the years ended december  and rail did not have a material impact on earnings for the year ended december  application of critical accounting policies and estimates we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in doing so  we made certain estimates that were critical in nature to the results of operations 
the following discusses those significant estimates that may have a material impact on our financial results and are subject to the greatest amount of subjectivity 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit and corporate performance committee audit committee of our board of directors 
utility regulation as discussed in note  our regulated utilities segments are subject to regulation that sets the prices rates we are permitted to charge customers based on the costs that regulatory agencies determine we are permitted to recover 
at times  regulators permit the future recovery through rates of costs that would be currently charged to expense by a nonregulated company 
this ratemaking process results in deferral of expense recognition and the recording of regulatory assets based on anticipated future cash inflows 
as a result of the different ratemaking processes in each state in which we operate  a significant amount of regulatory assets has been recorded 
we continually review these assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within the approved regulatory guidelines 
impairment risk associated with these assets relates to potentially adverse legislative  judicial or regulatory actions in the future 
additionally  the state regulatory agencies often provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property  nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of the regulatory assets 
see note for additional information related to the impact of utility regulation on our operations 
asset impairments as discussed in note  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives for impairment whenever indicators exist 
examples of these indicators include current period losses combined with a history of losses  a projection of continuing losses  a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset group  or the likelihood that an asset group will be disposed of significantly prior to the end of its useful life 
if an indicator exists  the asset group held and used is tested for recoverability by comparing the carrying value to the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group 
if the asset group is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows or if the asset group is to be disposed of  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset group 
performing an impairment test on long lived assets involves management s judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances indicating an impairment may exist  identifying and grouping affected assets at the appropriate level  and developing the undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset group 
estimates of future cash flows contemplate factors such as expected use of the assets  future production and sales levels  and expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed 
therefore  estimates of future cash flows are  by nature  highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results 
the carrying value of our total utility plant  net is billion at december  the carrying value of our total diversified business property  net is million at december  in addition  we have certain diversified business property with a carrying value of million at december   included in net assets of discontinued operations see note h 
our exposure to potential impairment losses for utility plant  net is mitigated by the fact that our regulated ratemaking process generally allows for recovery of our investment in utility plant plus an allowed return on the investment  as long as the costs are prudently incurred 
under the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties  total capitalized costs are limited to a ceiling based on the present value of discounted at future net revenues using current prices  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
the ceiling test takes into consideration the prices of qualifying cash flow hedges as of the balance sheet date 
if the ceiling discounted revenues does not exceed total capitalized costs  we are required to write down capitalized costs to the ceiling 
we performed this ceiling test calculation every quarter prior to the sale of the gas operations see note b 
no write downs were required in or see discussion of synthetic fuels asset impairments in other matters synthetic fuels tax credits and in notes and goodwill as discussed in note  we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist 
for our utility segments  the goodwill impairment tests are performed at the utility operating segment level 
we performed the annual goodwill impairment test for both the pec and pef segments in the second quarters of and  each of which indicated no impairment 
if the fair values for the utility segments were lower by five percent  there still would be no impact on the reported value of their goodwill 
the carrying amounts of goodwill at december  and  for reportable segments pec and pef  were billion and billion  respectively 
the amounts assigned to pec and pef are recorded in our corporate and other business segment 
for our former progress ventures segment  the goodwill impairment tests were performed at our georgia region reporting unit level  which was comprised of four nonregulated generation plants and was one level below the progress ventures segment 
we performed the annual goodwill impairment test for our georgia region reporting unit in the first quarters of and the test in indicated no impairment 
in  the test indicated that goodwill was fully impaired  and we recognized a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax during the first quarter of we calculated the fair value of our segments and reporting units by considering various factors  including valuation studies based primarily on a discounted cash flow methodology and published industry valuations and market data as supporting information 
these calculations are dependent on subjective factors such as management s estimate of future cash flows  the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates  and assumptions about the timing of when unregulated energy supply and demand would reach market equilibrium 
these underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time  subsequent changes  particularly changes in the discount rates  growth rates or the timing of market equilibrium  could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill 
synthetic fuels tax credits our coal and synthetic fuels business unit owns facilities that produce coal based solid synthetic fuels as defined under the internal revenue code 
the production and sale of the synthetic fuels from these facilities qualifies for tax credits under section k if certain requirements are satisfied  including a requirement that the synthetic fuels differ significantly in chemical composition from the coal used to produce such synthetic fuels and that the synthetic fuels were produced from a facility placed in service before july  for and prior years  the amount of section credits that we were allowed to generate in any calendar year was limited by the amount of our regular federal income tax liability 
section tax credit amounts allowed but not utilized through december   are carried forward indefinitely as deferred alternative minimum tax credits on the consolidated balance sheets 
for and  the section tax credits have been redesignated as a section k general business credit  which removes the regular federal income tax liability limit on synthetic fuels production and subjects the credits to a year carry forward period 
this provision allows us to produce synthetic fuels at a higher level than we have historically produced  should we choose to do so 
the current section k tax credit program expires at the end of in addition  section k provides that if the average wellhead price per barrel for unregulated domestic crude oil for the year the annual average price exceeds a certain threshold value the threshold price  the amount of tax credits is reduced for that year 
also  if the annual average price increases high enough the phase out price  the section k tax credits are eliminated for that year 
the threshold price and the phase out price are adjusted annually for inflation 
we estimate that the annual average price will result in an approximate percent phase out of the synthetic fuels tax credits related to synthetic fuels production in this estimate is derived from our estimates of the threshold price and phase out price of per barrel and per barrel  respectively  based on an estimated inflation adjustment for for synthetic fuels production  the annual average price is not known until after the end of the year  we will record the tax credits based on our estimates of what we believe the annual average price will be for these estimates are based on oil prices in the futures market 
any portion of the tax credits that would be phased out based on the projected annual average price exceeding the threshold price will not be recorded 
we estimate that the threshold price will be approximately per barrel and the phase out price will be approximately per barrel  based on estimated inflation adjustments for and the monthly domestic crude oil first purchases price published by the energy information agency eia has recently averaged approximately lower than the corresponding daily new york mercantile exchange nymex prompt month settlement price for light sweet crude oil 
as of january   the average nymex futures price for light sweet crude oil for calendar year was per barrel 
based upon the estimated threshold price and phase out price  if oil prices for the rest of remained at the january   average futures price level of per barrel  we currently estimate that the synthetic fuels tax credit amount for would not be reduced 
see further discussion in other matters synthetic fuels tax credits and item a  risk factors 
pension costs as discussed in note a  we maintain qualified noncontributory defined benefit retirement pension plans 
our reported costs are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
for example  such costs are impacted by employee demographics  changes made to plan provisions  actual plan asset returns and key actuarial assumptions  such as expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates used in determining benefit obligations and annual costs 
due to an increase in the market interest rates for high quality aaa aa debt securities  which are used as the benchmark for setting the discount rate used to present value future benefit payments  we increased the discount rate to approximately at december   from approximately at december   which will decrease the benefit costs recognized  all other factors remaining constant 
our discount rates are selected based on a plan by plan study by our actuary  which matches our projected benefit payments to a high quality corporate yield curve 
plan assets performed well in  with returns of approximately 
that positive asset performance will result in decreased pension costs in  all other factors remaining constant 
evaluations of the effects of these and other factors on our pension costs have not been completed  but we estimate that the total cost recognized for pensions in will be million to million  compared with million recognized in we have pension plan assets with a fair value of approximately billion at december  our expected rate of return on pension plan assets is 
we review this rate on a regular basis 
under sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions sfas no 
 the expected rate of return used in pension cost recognition is a long term rate of return  therefore  we do not adjust that rate of return frequently 
in  we elected to lower our expected rate of return from to 
the rate of return represents the lower end of our future expected return range given our asset allocation policy 
a change in the expected rate of return for would have changed pension costs by approximately million 
another factor affecting our pension costs  and sensitivity of the costs to plan asset performance  is the method selected to determine the market related value of assets  ie  the asset value to which the expected long term rate of return is applied 
sfas no 
specifies that entities may use either fair value or an averaging method that recognizes changes in fair value over a period not to exceed five years  with the method selected applied on a consistent basis from year to year 
we have historically used a five year averaging method 
when we acquired florida progress in  we retained the florida progress historical use of fair value to determine market related value for florida progress pension assets 
changes in plan asset performance are reflected in pension costs sooner under the fair value method than the five year averaging method  and  therefore  pension costs tend to be more volatile using the fair value method 
approximately percent of our pension plan assets are subject to each of the two methods 
liquidity and capital resources overview progress energy  inc is a holding company and  as such  has no revenue generating operations of its own 
our primary cash needs at the parent level are our common stock dividend and interest and principal payments on our billion of senior unsecured debt 
our ability to meet these needs is dependent on the earnings and cash flows of the utilities and our nonregulated subsidiaries  and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or repay funds to us 
our other significant cash requirements arise primarily from the capital intensive nature of the utilities operations  including expenditures for environmental compliance 
we rely upon our operating cash flow  primarily generated by the utilities  commercial paper and bank facilities  and our ability to access the long term debt and equity capital markets for sources of liquidity 
the majority of our operating costs are related to the utilities 
most of these costs are recovered from ratepayers in accordance with various rate plans 
we are allowed to recover certain fuel  purchased power and other costs incurred by pec and pef through their respective recovery clauses 
the types of costs recovered through clauses vary by jurisdiction 
fuel price volatility can lead to over or under recovery of fuel costs  as changes in fuel prices are not immediately reflected in fuel surcharges due to regulatory lag in setting the surcharges 
as a result  fuel price volatility can be both a source of and a use of liquidity resources  depending on what phase of the cycle of price volatility we are experiencing 
changes in the utilities fuel and purchased power costs may affect the timing of cash flows  but not materially affect net income 
prior to february   we were a registered holding company under puhca  and therefore we obtained approval from the securities and exchange commission sec for the issuance and sale of securities as well as the establishment of intercompany extensions of credit utility and nonutility money pools 
pec and pef participate in the utility money pool  which allows the two utilities to lend to and borrow from each other 
a nonutility money pool allows our nonregulated operations to lend to and borrow from each other 
the parent can lend money to the utility and nonutility money pools but cannot borrow funds 
the energy policy act of epact repealed puhca effective february   and transferred to the ferc certain new responsibilities with respect to the regulation of utility holding companies under the public utilities holding company act of puhca 
pursuant to puhca  utility holding companies are allowed to continue to engage in financings authorized by the sec  provided the authorization orders have been filed with the ferc and the holding company continues to comply with such orders  terms and conditions 
we have filed all such sec orders with the ferc  therefore  we are permitted to continue all such financing transactions 
cash from operations  asset sales  short term and long term debt and limited ongoing equity sales from our investor plus stock purchase plan and employee benefit and stock option plans are expected to fund capital expenditures and common stock dividends for for the fiscal year  we expect to realize an aggregate amount of approximately million from the sale of stock through these plans 
we believe our internal and external liquidity resources will be sufficient to fund our current business plans 
risk factors associated with credit facilities and credit ratings are discussed below and in item a  risk factors 
the following discussion of our liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis 
historical for as compared to and as compared to cash flows from operations cash from operations is the primary source used to meet operating requirements and capital expenditures 
net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the three years ended december   and  was billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
cash from operating activities for increased when compared with the million increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to a million increase in the recovery of fuel costs at the utilities  a million increase from the change in accounts receivable  approximately million of proceeds received from the restructuring of a long term coal supply contract  and million related to recovery of storm restoration costs at pef 
these impacts were partially offset by a million net increase in tax payments in compared to  million related to a wholesale customer prepayment in at pec  as discussed below  and a million decrease from the change in accounts payable 
the million change in accounts receivable included million at pec  principally driven by the timing of wholesale sales  and approximately million at pef  primarily related to timing of receipts 
in and  the utilities filed requests with their respective state commissions seeking rate increases for fuel cost recovery  including amounts for previous under recoveries 
in  pef also received approval from the florida public service commission fpsc authorizing pef to recover million over a two year period  including interest  of the costs it incurred and previously deferred related to pef s restoration of power to customers associated with the four hurricanes in see future liquidity and capital resources and note for additional information 
cash from operating activities for decreased when compared with the million decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to a million decrease in the recovery of fuel costs at the utilities  driven by rising fuel costs  and increased working capital needs of million  partially offset by a million reduction in storm cost spending at pef in compared to cash from operating activities for also includes a million prepayment received from a wholesale customer 
in november  pec entered into a contract with the public works commission of the city of fayetteville  north carolina pwc  in which the pwc prepaid million in exchange for future capacity and energy power sales 
the prepayment is expected to cover approximately two years of electricity service and includes a prepayment discount of approximately million 
in  the utilities filed requests with their respective state commissions seeking rate increases for fuel cost recovery  including amounts for previous under recoveries 
pef also received approval from the fpsc authorizing pef to recover million over a two year period  including interest  of the costs it incurred and previously deferred related to pef s restoration of power to customers associated with the four hurricanes in see future liquidity and capital resources and note for additional information 
the increase in working capital needs for compared to was mainly driven by a million increase in the change in receivables  a million increase in prepayments and other current assets  and a million increase in inventory purchases  primarily coal at pec 
these impacts were partially offset by a million increase in the change in accounts payable and the current portion of the prepayment received from the pwc as discussed above 
the increase in the change in receivables is primarily due to increased sales at the utilities driven by weather  rising fuel costs and timing of receipts  and increased sales at our nonregulated subsidiaries  mainly driven by changes in the production level of our synthetic fuels facilities over the prior year 
the change in accounts payable is primarily due to higher fuel prices at pef and increased quantities of coal purchases at our nonregulated subsidiaries 
investing activities net cash provided used by investing activities for the three years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
excluding proceeds from sales of discontinued operations and other assets of billion in and million in  cash used in investing activities decreased slightly in when compared with the decrease in was primarily due to a million increase in net proceeds from available for sale securities and other investments  a million decrease in nuclear fuel additions  and a million decrease in other investing activities  largely offset by a million increase in capital expenditures for utility property 
at pec  the increase in utility property was primarily due to environmental compliance and mobile meter reading project expenditures 
at pef  the increase in utility property was primarily due to repowering the bartow plant to more efficient natural gas burning technology  various distribution  transmission and steam production projects  and higher spending at the hines unit facility  partially offset by lower spending at the hines unit facility 
available for sale securities and other investments include marketable debt and equity securities and investments held in nuclear decommissioning and benefit investment trusts 
utility property additions  including nuclear fuel  for our regulated electric operations were billion and billion in and  respectively  or approximately percent of consolidated capital expenditures in both and capital expenditures for our regulated electric operations are primarily for capacity expansion and normal construction activity and ongoing capital expenditures related to environmental compliance programs 
during  proceeds from sales of discontinued operations and other assets  net of cash divested  primarily included approximately billion from the sale of gas see note b  million from the sale of desoto and rowan see note c  approximately million from the sale of pt llc see note d  approximately million from the sale of certain net assets of the coal mining business see note f  and approximately million from the sale of dixie fuels see note e 
excluding proceeds from sales of discontinued operations and other assets  net of cash divested  cash used in investing activities increased approximately million in when compared with the increase is due primarily to a million decrease in net proceeds from available for sale securities and other investments and a million increase in capital expenditures for utility property and nuclear fuel additions 
available for sale securities and other investments include marketable debt securities and investments held in nuclear decommissioning and benefit investment trusts 
during  proceeds from sales of discontinued operations and other assets  net of cash divested  primarily included million in base proceeds from the sale of progress rail in march and million in proceeds from the sale of winter park distribution assets in june see notes g and c 
during  proceeds from sales of discontinued operations and other assets  net of cash divested  primarily included proceeds of approximately million related to the sale of natural gas assets in the forth worth basin of texas and proceeds from the sale of railcar ltd 
assets of approximately million 
we used the proceeds from these sales to reduce indebtedness  including million to pay off a pvi bank facility 
financing activities net cash used provided by financing activities for the three years ended december   and  was billion  million and million  respectively 
see note for details of debt and credit facilities 
for  proceeds from sales of discontinued operations and other assets  net of cash divested  were used to reduce holding company debt by billion 
the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily related to the retirement of long term debt in the current year  as discussed below  and a decrease in the proceeds from issuances of long term debt 
for  cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to additional issuances of long term debt at the utilities and an increase in common stock issuances 
for  cash from operations exceeded net cash used in investing activities by million due primarily to asset sales  which allowed for a net decrease in cash requirements provided by financing activities 
in addition to the financing activities discussed under overview  our financing activities included on january   progress energy issued million of senior notes due and million of series a floating rate senior notes due these senior notes are unsecured

future liquidity and capital resources please review item a  risk factors and safe harbor for forward looking statements for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward looking statements made herein 
the utilities produced substantially all of our consolidated cash from operations for the years ended december  and it is expected that the utilities will continue to produce substantially all of the consolidated cash flows from operations over the next several years 
our synthetic fuels operations do not currently produce positive operating cash flow due to the difference in timing of when tax credits are recognized for financial reporting purposes and when tax credits are realized for tax purposes see other matters synthetic fuels tax credits 
cash from operations plus availability under our credit facilities and shelf registration statements is expected to be sufficient to meet our requirements in the near term 
to the extent necessary  we may also use limited ongoing equity sales from our investor plus stock purchase plan and employee benefit and stock option plans to meet our liquidity requirements 
over the long term  meeting the anticipated load growth at the utilities will require a balanced approach  including energy conservation and efficiency programs  development and deployment of new energy technologies  and new generation  transmission and distribution facilities  potentially including new baseload generation facilities in both florida and the carolinas by the middle of the next decade 
this approach will require the utilities to make significant capital investments 
see introduction strategy regulated utilities for additional information 
these anticipated capital investments are expected to be funded through a combination of long term debt  preferred stock and common equity  which is dependent on our ability to successfully access capital markets 
we may pursue joint ventures or similar arrangements with third parties in order to share some of the financing and operational risks associated with new baseload generation 
the amount and timing of future sales of company securities will depend on market conditions  operating cash flow  asset sales and our specific needs 
we may from time to time sell securities beyond the amount immediately needed to meet capital requirements in order to allow for the early redemption of long term debt  the redemption of preferred stock  the reduction of short term debt or for other general corporate purposes 
at december   the current portion of our long term debt was million  which we expect to fund with a combination of cash from operations  proceeds from sales of assets  commercial paper borrowings and long term debt 
see note for additional information on asset sales 
regulatory matters and recovery of costs regulatory matters  as discussed in other matters regulatory environment and note  and filings for recovery of environmental costs  as discussed in note and in other matters environmental matters  may impact our future liquidity and financing activities 
the impacts of these matters  including the timing of recoveries from ratepayers  can be both a source of and a use of future liquidity resources 
base rates pec s base rates are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the north carolina utilities commission ncuc and the south carolina public service commission scpsc 
as further discussed in note b  the clean smokestacks act was enacted in the clean smokestacks act freezes north carolina electric utility base rates for a five year period ending in december  unless there are extraordinary events beyond the control of the utilities or unless the utilities persistently earn a return substantially in excess of the rate of return established and found reasonable by the ncuc in the respective utility s last general rate case 
subsequent to  pec s current north carolina base rates will continue subject to traditional cost based rate regulation 
as a result of a base rate proceeding in  pef is party to a base rate settlement agreement that was effective with the first billing cycle of january and will remain in effect through the last billing cycle of december  with pef having sole option to extend the agreement through the last billing cycle of june the settlement agreement also provides for revenue sharing between pef and its ratepayers beginning in whereby pef will refund two thirds of retail base revenues between a specified threshold and specified cap  which will be adjusted annually  and percent of revenues above the specified cap 
pef s retail base revenues did not exceed the specified threshold  and thus no revenues were subject to revenue sharing 
the settlement agreement provides for pef to continue to recover certain costs through clauses  such as the recovery of post security costs through the capacity clause and the carrying costs of coal inventory in transit and coal procurement costs through the fuel clause 
additionally  pef will continue to recover and collect a return on hines unit through the fuel clause through late  when it will be transferred into base rates 
if pef s regulatory return on equity roe falls below percent  and for certain other events  pef is authorized to petition the fpsc for a base rate increase 
pec fuel cost recovery on june   the scpsc approved a settlement agreement for an increase in the fuel rate charged to pec s south carolina ratepayers for under recovered fuel costs and to meet future expected fuel costs 
the settlement agreement provided for a million  or percent  increase in rates  effective july  at december   pec s south carolina deferred fuel balance was million  of which million is expected to be collected after in accordance with the settlement agreement and  therefore  has been classified as a long term regulatory asset 
on september   the ncuc approved a settlement agreement for an increase in the fuel rate charged to pec s north carolina ratepayers 
the settlement agreement provided for a million  or percent  increase in rates effective october  the settlement agreement further provides for rate increases of million in and million in and for pec to collect its existing deferred fuel balance by september  pec initially sought an increase of million  or percent  but agreed to a three year phase in of the increase in order to address customer concerns regarding the magnitude of the proposed increase 
pec will be allowed to calculate and collect interest at on the difference between its fuel factor proposed in its original request to the ncuc and the settlement agreement s factor 
at december   pec s north carolina deferred fuel balance was million  of which million is expected to be collected after in accordance with the settlement agreement and  therefore  has been classified as a long term regulatory asset 
the carolina utility customers association cuca has appealed the ncuc s order on the grounds that the ncuc does not have the statutory authority to establish fuel rates for more than one year 
we anticipate filing a motion to dismiss during the first quarter of we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
pef pass through clause cost recovery on november   the fpsc approved pef s supplemental filing resulting in a million  or percent  increase over rates to cover rising fuel  environmental compliance and energy conservation costs 
the new charges were effective january  at december   pef was over recovered in fuel and capacity costs by million 
on august   florida s office of public counsel opc filed a petition with the fpsc asking that the fpsc require pef to refund to ratepayers million  plus interest  of alleged excessive past fuel recovery charges and sulfur dioxide so allowance costs associated with pef s purported failure to utilize the most economical sources of coal at crystal river unit and crystal river unit cr and cr during the period to the opc subsequently revised its claim to million  plus interest 
a hearing on the matter has been scheduled by the fpsc for april  pef believes that its coal procurement practices were prudent and that it has sound legal and factual arguments to successfully defend its position 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
on february   the fpsc issued an order approving pef s request for a need determination to uprate crystal river unit no 
nuclear plant cr 
the uprate will take place in two stages in and and is estimated to cost approximately million  which includes potential transmission system improvements and modifications to comply with environmental regulations 
the fpsc has scheduled a hearing on may   to determine whether the uprate costs should be recovered through the fuel adjustment clause 
if pef does not receive approval to recover the uprate costs through the fuel adjustment clause  these costs will be recoverable through base rates  similar to other utility plant additions 
on february   intervenors filed a motion to abate the cost recovery portion of pef s request 
on february   pef requested that the fpsc deny the intervenors motion as legally deficient and without merit 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
pef has received approval from the fpsc for recovery of costs associated with the remediation of distribution and substation transformers through the environmental cost recovery clause ecrc  which were estimated to be million at december  additionally  on november   the fpsc approved pef s petition for its integrated strategy to address compliance with cair  camr and cavr through the ecrc 
the fpsc also approved cost recovery of prudently incurred costs necessary to achieve this strategy  which are currently estimated to be million to billion 
storm cost recovery in  the fpsc issued orders authorizing pef to recover over a two year period  including interest  costs it incurred and previously deferred related to pef s restoration of power to customers associated with the four hurricanes in  including million beginning august   and an additional million  beginning january  on august   the fpsc approved a settlement agreement related to pef s storm cost recovery docket that would allow pef to extend its current two year storm surcharge for an additional month period to replenish its storm reserve 
the requested extension  which begins in august  will replenish the existing storm reserve by an estimated additional million 
in the event future storms deplete the reserve  pef would be able to petition the fpsc for implementation of an interim surcharge of at least percent and up to percent of the claimed deficiency of its storm reserve 
intervenors agreed not to oppose the interim recovery of percent of the future claimed deficiency but reserved the right to challenge the interim surcharge recovery of the remaining percent 
the fpsc has the right to review pef s storm costs for prudence 
nuclear cost recovery in response to legislation passed by the florida legislature in  the fpsc has promulgated rules that will allow pef to recover prudently incurred siting  preconstruction costs and allowance for funds used during construction afudc on an annual basis through the capacity cost recovery clause 
such amounts will not be included in pef s rate base when the plant is placed in commercial operation 
in addition  the rule will require the fpsc to conduct an annual prudence review of the reasonableness and prudence of all such costs  including construction costs  and such determination shall not be subject to later review except upon a finding of fraud  intentional misrepresentation or the intentional withholding of key information by the utility 
the fpsc approved the new rules on february  other matters on november   the fpsc approved pef s petition for determination of need for the construction of a fourth unit at pef s hines energy complex 
the estimated total in service cost of hines unit approved as part of the determination of need was million 
the unit is planned for commercial operation in december if the actual cost is less than the original estimate  ratepayers will receive the benefit of such cost under runs 
any costs that exceed this estimate will not be recoverable absent  among other things  extraordinary circumstances as found by the fpsc in subsequent proceedings 
the current estimate of in service cost exceeds the initial project estimate by approximately percent to percent due to what we believe to be extraordinary circumstances 
therefore  we believe that disallowance of these costs by the fpsc in subsequent proceedings is not probable 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
capital expenditures total cash from operations provided the funding for our capital expenditures  including property additions  nuclear fuel expenditures and diversified business property additions during as shown in the table below  we expect the majority of our capital expenditures to be incurred at our regulated operations 
we expect to fund our capital requirements primarily through a combination of internally generated funds  long term debt  preferred stock and or common equity 
in addition  we have billion in credit facilities that support the issuance of commercial paper 
access to the commercial paper market provides additional liquidity to help meet working capital requirements 
we anticipate our regulated capital expenditures will increase in and  primarily due to increased spending on environmental initiatives and current growth and maintenance projects 
afudc represents the costs of capital funds necessary to finance the construction of new regulated assets 
actual forecasted in millions regulated capital expenditures nuclear fuel expenditures afudc borrowed funds nonregulated capital and other expenditures total regulated capital expenditures for  and in the table above include approximately million  million and million  respectively  for environmental compliance capital expenditures 
forecasted environmental compliance capital expenditures for  and include million  million and million  respectively  at pec and million  million and million  respectively  at pef 
we currently estimate that total future capital expenditures for the utilities to comply with current environmental laws and regulations addressing air and water quality  which are eligible for regulatory recovery through either base rates or cost recovery clauses  could be in excess of billion each at pec and pef through  which is the latest compliance target date for current air and water quality regulations 
see other matters environmental matters for further discussion of our environmental compliance costs and related recovery of costs 
all projected capital and investment expenditures are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary significantly depending on a number of factors including  but not limited to  industry restructuring  regulatory constraints  market volatility and economic trends

off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations our off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations are described below 
guarantees as a part of normal business  we enter into various agreements providing future financial or performance assurances to third parties that are outside the scope of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
these agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to progress energy or our subsidiaries on a stand alone basis  thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiaries intended commercial purposes 
our guarantees include performance obligations under power supply agreements  tolling agreements  transmission agreements  gas agreements  fuel procurement agreements and trading operations 
our guarantees also include standby letters of credit and surety bonds 
at december   we have issued billion of guarantees for future financial or performance assurance  including million at pec and million at pef 
included in this amount is million of guarantees of certain payments of two wholly owned indirect subsidiaries issued by the parent see note 
we do not believe conditions are likely for significant performance under the guarantees of performance issued by or on behalf of affiliates 
the majority of contracts supported by the guarantees contain provisions that trigger guarantee obligations based on downgrade events to below investment grade below baa or bbb by moody s or s p for the parent s senior unsecured debt rating  ratings triggers  monthly netting of exposure and or payments and offset provisions in the event of a default

if the guarantee obligations were triggered  the approximate amount of liquidity requirements to support ongoing operations within a day period  associated with guarantees for progress energy s nonregulated portfolio and power supply agreements  was million at december  while we believe that we would be able to meet this obligation with cash or letters of credit  if we cannot  our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations will be materially and adversely impacted 
at december   we have issued guarantees and indemnifications of certain asset performance  legal  tax and environmental matters to third parties  including indemnifications made in connection with sales of businesses  and for timely payment of obligations in support of our nonwholly owned synthetic fuels operations as discussed in note c 
market risk and derivatives under our risk management policy  we may use a variety of instruments  including swaps  options and forward contracts  to manage exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
see note and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of market risk and derivatives 
contractual obligations we are party to numerous contracts and arrangements obligating us to make cash payments in future years 
these contracts include financial arrangements such as debt agreements and leases  as well as contracts for the purchase of goods and services 
amounts in the following table are estimated based upon contractual terms  and actual amounts will likely differ from amounts presented below 
further disclosure regarding our contractual obligations is included in the respective notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we take into consideration the future commitments when assessing our liquidity and future financing needs

f in  pec must begin transitioning north carolina jurisdictional amounts currently retained internally to its external decommissioning funds 
the transition of million must be complete by december   and at least percent must be transitioned each year 
g we have certain future commitments related to four synthetic fuels facilities purchased that provide for contingent payments royalties through see note d 
other matters synthetic fuels tax credits historically  we have had substantial operations associated with the production of coal based solid synthetic fuels as defined under section of the code section 
the production and sale of these products qualifies for federal income tax credits so long as certain requirements are satisfied  including a requirement that the synthetic fuels differ significantly in chemical composition from the coal used to produce such synthetic fuels and that the fuel was produced from a facility that was placed in service before july  qualifying synthetic fuels facilities entitle their owners to federal income tax credits based on the barrel of oil equivalent of the synthetic fuels produced and sold by these plants 
the tax credits associated with synthetic fuels in a particular year may be phased out if annual average market prices for crude oil exceed certain prices 
synthetic fuels are generally not economical to produce and sell absent the credits 
in may  we idled production of synthetic fuels at our synthetic fuels facilities 
as discussed below in impact of crude oil prices  the decision to idle production was based on the high level of oil prices 
based on significantly reduced oil prices combined with current favorable fuel price projections  we resumed limited production at our synthetic fuels facilities in september and october  which continued through the end of we produced million tons of synthetic fuels during tax credits legislation enacted in redesignated the section tax credit as a general business credit under section k of the code section k effective january  the previous amount of section tax credits that we were allowed to claim in any calendar year through december   was limited by the amount of our regular federal income tax liability 
section tax credit amounts allowed but not utilized are carried forward indefinitely as deferred alternative minimum tax credits 
the redesignation of section tax credits as a section k general business credit removes the regular federal income tax liability limit on synthetic fuels production and subjects the credits to a year carry forward period 
this provision would allow us to produce more synthetic fuels than we have historically produced  should we choose to do so 
total section k credits generated through december  including those generated by florida progress prior to our acquisition  were approximately billion  of which million has been used to offset regular federal income tax liability  million is being carried forward as deferred tax credits and million has been reserved due to the estimated phase out of tax credits due to high oil prices  as described below 
impact of crude oil prices although the section k tax credit program is expected to continue through  recent market conditions  world events and catastrophic weather events have increased the volatility and level of oil prices that could limit the amount of those credits or eliminate them entirely for this possibility is due to a provision of section that provides that if the annual average price exceeds the threshold price  the amount of section k tax credits is reduced for that year 
also  if the annual average price exceeds the phase out price  the section k tax credits are eliminated for that year 
the threshold price and the phase out price are adjusted annually for inflation 
if the annual average price falls between the threshold price and the phase out price for a year  the amount by which section k tax credits are reduced will depend on where the annual average price falls in that continuum 
for example  for  the threshold price was per barrel and the phase out price was per barrel 
if the annual average price had been per barrel  there would have been a percent reduction in the amount of section tax credits for that year 
based on the annual average price of  there was no phase out of our synthetic fuels tax credits in the department of the treasury calculates the annual average price based on the domestic crude oil first purchases prices published by the eia 
because the eia publishes its information on a three month lag  the secretary of the treasury finalizes the calculations three months after the year in question ends 
thus  the annual average price for calendar year is expected to be published in early april we estimate that the threshold price will be approximately per barrel and the phase out price will be approximately per barrel  based on an estimated inflation adjustment for the monthly domestic crude oil first purchases price published by the eia has recently averaged approximately lower than the corresponding daily nymex prompt month settlement price for light sweet crude oil 
through december   the average daily nymex settlement price for light sweet crude oil was per barrel 
based upon the estimated threshold price and phase out price  assuming that the average differential between the domestic crude oil first purchases price published by the eia and the nymex settlement price continued through december   we estimate that the synthetic fuels tax credit amount for will be reduced by approximately percent 
therefore  we reserved percent or approximately million of the million of tax credits generated during the final calculations of any reductions in the value of the tax credits will not be determined until april when final oil prices are published 
we estimate that the threshold price will be approximately per barrel and the phase out price will be approximately per barrel  based on an estimated inflation adjustment for and the monthly domestic crude oil first purchases price published by the eia has recently averaged approximately lower than the corresponding daily nymex prompt month settlement price for light sweet crude oil 
as of january   the average nymex futures price for light sweet crude oil for calendar year was per barrel 
based upon the estimated threshold price and phase out price  if oil prices for the rest of remained at the january   average futures price level of per barrel  we currently estimate that the synthetic fuels tax credit amount for would not be reduced 
in january we entered into derivative contracts to hedge economically a portion of our synthetic fuels cash flow exposure to the risk of rising oil prices 
these contracts will provide protection for the equivalent of approximately eight million tons of synthetic fuels production and will be marked to market with changes in fair value recorded through earnings 
our synthetic fuels production levels for remain uncertain because we cannot predict with any certainty the annual average price of oil for we will continue to monitor the environment surrounding synthetic fuels production and will adjust our production as warranted by changing conditions 
see note and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for a discussion of market risk and derivatives 
impairment of synthetic fuels and other related long lived assets we monitor our long lived assets for impairment as warranted 
with the idling of our synthetic fuels facilities during the second quarter of  we performed an impairment evaluation of our synthetic fuels and other related operating long lived assets 
the impairment test considered numerous factors  including  among other things  continued high oil prices and the then current idle state of our synthetic fuels facilities 
based on the results of the impairment test  we recorded pre tax impairment charges of million million after tax during the quarter ended june  see notes and 
these charges represent the entirety of the asset carrying value of our synthetic fuels intangible assets and manufacturing facilities  as well as a portion of the asset carrying value associated with the river terminals at which the synthetic fuels manufacturing facilities are located 
sale of partnership interest in june  through our subsidiary progress fuels  we sold in two transactions a combined percent partnership interest in colona  one of our synthetic fuels facilities 
substantially all proceeds from the sales will be received over time  which is typical of such sales in the industry 
gains from the sales will be recognized on a cost recovery basis as the facility produces and sells synthetic fuels and when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have become fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
gain recognition is dependent on the synthetic fuels production qualifying for section k tax credits and the value of such tax credits as discussed above 
until the gain recognition criteria are met  gains from selling interests in colona will be deferred 
it is possible that gains will be deferred to subsequent quarters  or to a subsequent calendar year  until there is persuasive evidence that no tax credit phase out will occur for the applicable calendar year 
this could result in shifting earnings from earlier quarters to later quarters in a calendar year or to a subsequent calendar year 
in the event that the synthetic fuels tax credits from the colona facility are reduced  including from an extended idling of our production due to an increase in the price of oil that could limit or eliminate synthetic fuels tax credits  the amount of proceeds realized from the sale could be significantly impacted 
at december   a pre tax gain on monetization of million has been deferred 
based on the current level of oil prices and subject to final adjustments  we expect to recognize this gain in beginning with the payment for the second quarter of  the minority interest parties have elected to defer their cash payments in consideration of the idling of the synthetic fuels facilities at that time 
in consideration of the resumption of limited synthetic fuels production in the fourth quarter of  the minority interest parties made a partial payment in january see note d and item a  risk factors for additional discussion related to our synthetic fuels operations 
regulatory environment the utilities operations in north carolina  south carolina and florida are regulated by the ncuc  scpsc and the fpsc  respectively 
the utilities are also subject to regulation by the ferc  the nuclear regulatory commission nrc and other federal and state agencies common to the utility business 
as a result of regulation  many of the fundamental business decisions  as well as the rate of return the utilities are permitted to earn  are subject to the approval of these governmental agencies 
pec and pef continue to monitor developments impacting retail competition in their respective service territories 
movement toward deregulation throughout the nation has effectively ceased due to numerous factors including  but not limited to  california s experience with retail deregulation 
to our knowledge  there is currently no enacted or proposed legislation in north carolina  south carolina or florida that would give retail customers the right to choose their electricity provider or otherwise restructure or deregulate the electric industry 
we cannot anticipate when  or if  any of these states will move to increase retail competition in the electric industry 
the retail rate matters affected by state regulatory authorities are discussed in detail in notes b and c 
this discussion identifies specific retail rate matters  the status of the issues and the associated effects on our consolidated financial statements 
issues regarding the timing  creation and structure of transmission organizations are evaluated by the utilities regulatory authorities 
we cannot predict the outcome of these matters see note d 
on may   the florida state legislature passed a comprehensive energy bill  which has been signed by the governor 
the legislation creates a new energy council tasked with developing a statewide energy policy  provides incentives to renewable energy sources and fosters the construction of new nuclear power plants  including streamlining the siting of nuclear power plants and related transmission facilities  exempting new nuclear plants from the fpsc bid rule and requiring the fpsc to issue rules authorizing alternative cost recovery mechanisms for pre construction costs and construction cost financing 
see nuclear below for related fpsc rule issuances 
pef cannot determine at this time how the final rules and regulations resulting from this legislation will impact its operations and financial condition 
due to the damage electric utility facilities suffered during recent hurricanes  during the fpsc adopted rules that require florida s investor owned electric utilities  including pef  to strengthen cost effectively  or storm harden  the state s electric infrastructure 
storm hardening plans are required to be filed and updated every three years for the fpsc s approval 
each plan must address such factors as the effect of extreme wind  flooding and storm surges on electric facilities 
the plans must identify critical infrastructure and the respective utilities deployment strategy for strengthening electric service in their service areas 
in addition  state utilities are required to inspect their wooden distribution poles once every eight years 
pef does not believe that compliance with these rules will materially increase pef s costs due to its pole inspection and vegetation maintenance programs already in effect 
costs to comply with the storm hardening rules are recoverable through pef s base rates 
the fpsc has published a proposed rule that specifies what storm costs will be recoverable and whether such recoverable costs would be offset against a utility s storm reserve fund or recoverable through its base rates 
the fpsc held a public workshop on february   to discuss the proposed rule with the intent to issue a final rule prior to the storm season 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
on april   pec submitted a license renewal application with the ferc seeking a year license for its tillery and blewett hydroelectric generating plants 
the license for these plants currently expires in april and the requested renewal will allow the plants to continue operations until pec and a key group of stakeholders have reached an agreement in principle that supports pec s relicensing application 
the agreement in principle  which has been filed with the ferc  will establish increased water flows from both plants and will protect water supplies for local governments as well as provide enhancements for recreation  water quality and aquatic habits 
the remaining phase of the application process will take approximately one year and includes review by the ferc and solicitation of public comment 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
in  the ferc issued orders concerning utilities ability to sell wholesale electricity at market based rates  including the adoption of two interim screens for assessing an applicant s potential generation market power for determining whether the applicant should be allowed to sell wholesale electricity at market based rates 
the utilities do not have market based rate authority for wholesale sales in peninsular florida 
given the difficulty pec believed it would experience in passing one of the interim screens  pec filed revisions to its market based rate tariffs restricting pec to sales outside of pec s control area and peninsular florida  and filed a new cost based tariff for sales within pec s control area 
the ferc has accepted these revised tariffs 
we do not anticipate that the operations of the utilities will be materially impacted by these market based rates decisions 
legal we are subject to federal  state and local legislation and court orders 
these matters are discussed in detail in note d 
this discussion identifies specific issues  the status of the issues  accruals associated with issue resolutions and our associated exposures 
nuclear nuclear generating units are regulated by the nrc 
in the event of noncompliance  the nrc has the authority to impose fines  set license conditions  shut down a nuclear unit or take some combination of these actions  depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation  until compliance is achieved 
our nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate normal refueling and maintenance outages  repairs and certain other modifications see notes and d 
due to the anticipated growth in our service territories  we estimate that we will require new baseload generation facilities in both florida and the carolinas by the middle of the next decade  and we are evaluating the best available options for this generation  including advanced design nuclear and clean coal technologies 
at this time  no definitive decision has been made 
we have announced that we are pursuing development of combined license col applications 
our announcement is not a commitment to build a nuclear plant 
it is a necessary step to keep open the option of building a plant or plants 
on january   we announced that pec selected a site at the shearon harris nuclear plant harris to evaluate for possible future nuclear expansion 
we currently expect to file the application for the col for pec s harris site in we have selected for pec the westinghouse electric ap reactor design as the technology upon which to base the potential application submission 
on december   we announced that pef selected a site in levy county  fla  to evaluate for possible future nuclear expansion  and pef expects to file the application for the col in we have not selected the reactor design technology upon which to base the pef potential application submission 
if we receive approval from the nrc and applicable state agencies  and if the decisions to build are made  construction activities could begin as early as  and new plants could be online in late the nrc estimates that it will take approximately three to four years to review and process the col applications 
on january   the us supreme court declined to hear an appeal of a ninth circuit us court of appeals decision in which the ninth circuit held that the nrc is required to consider the environmental impacts of terrorist attacks under the national environmental policy act in authorizing an independent spent fuel storage installation 
similar cases  including cases involving operating license renewals  are pending in seven other jurisdictions 
the nrc is considering the scope and import of the ninth circuit s decision in reviewing its operating license renewal program 
the extent and timing of the nrc s application of the case is unclear at this time  and the impact  if any  on pec s pending harris operating license renewal application or any future pec or pef operating licensing proceedings cannot be predicted at this time 
a new nuclear plant may be eligible for the federal production tax credits and risk insurance provided by epact 
epact provides an annual tax credit of cents per kwh for nuclear facilities for the first eight years of operation 
the credit is limited to the first  mw of new nuclear generation in the united states and has an annual cap of million per  mw of national mw capacity limitation allocated to the unit 
in april  the irs provided interim guidance that the  mw of production tax credits generally will be allocated to new nuclear facilities that file license applications with the nrc by december   had poured safety related concrete prior to january   and were placed in service before january  there is no guarantee that the interim guidance will be incorporated into the final regulations governing the allocation of production tax credits 
multiple utilities have announced plans to pursue new nuclear plants 
there is no guarantee that any nuclear plant we construct would qualify for these or other incentives 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
in accordance with provisions of florida s comprehensive energy bill discussed above  in december  the fpsc ordered new rules that would allow investor owned utilities such as pef to request partial recovery of the planning and construction costs of a nuclear power plant prior to commercial operation 
the fpsc issued a final rule on february   under which utilities will be allowed to recover prudently incurred siting  preconstruction costs and afudc on an annual basis through the capacity cost recovery clause 
such amounts will not be included in a utility s rate base when the plant is placed in commercial operation 
in addition  the rule will require the fpsc to conduct an annual prudence review of the reasonableness and prudence of all such costs  including construction costs  and such determination shall not be subject to later review except upon a finding of fraud  intentional misrepresentation or the intentional withholding of key information by the utility 
also  on february   the fpsc amended its power plant bid rules to  among other things  exempt nuclear power plants from existing bid requirements 
environmental matters we are subject to regulation by various federal  state and local authorities in the areas of air quality  water quality  control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes  and other environmental matters 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to our business and operations and believe we have all necessary permits to conduct such operations 
environmental laws and regulations frequently change and the ultimate costs of compliance cannot always be precisely estimated 
hazardous and solid waste management the provisions of the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  authorize the epa to require the cleanup of hazardous waste sites 
this statute imposes retroactive joint and several liabilities 
some states  including north carolina  south carolina and florida  have similar types of statutes 
we are periodically notified by regulators  including the epa and various state agencies  of our involvement or potential involvement in sites that may require investigation and or remediation 
there are presently several sites with respect to which we have been notified of our potential liability by the epa  the state of north carolina or the state of florida 
various organic materials associated with the production of manufactured gas  generally referred to as coal tar  are regulated under federal and state laws 
pec and pef are each potentially responsible parties prps at several manufactured gas plant mgp sites 
we are also currently in the process of assessing potential costs and exposures at other sites 
these costs are eligible for regulatory recovery through either base rates or cost recovery clauses see notes and 
both pec and pef evaluate potential claims against other potential prps and insurance carriers and plan to submit claims for cost recovery where appropriate 
the outcome of these potential claims cannot be predicted 
no material claims are currently pending 
hazardous and solid waste management matters are discussed in detail in note we accrue costs to the extent our liability is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
because the extent of environmental impact  allocation among prps for all sites  remediation alternatives which could involve either minimal or significant efforts  and concurrence of the regulatory authorities have not yet reached the stage where a reasonable estimate of the remediation costs can be made  we cannot determine the total costs that may be incurred in connection with the remediation of all sites at this time 
it is probable that current estimates could change and additional losses  which could be material  may be incurred in the future 
air quality and water quality we are  or may ultimately be  subject to various current and proposed federal  state and local environmental compliance laws and regulations  which would likely result in increased planned capital expenditures and o m expenses 
additionally  congress is considering legislation that would require additional reductions in air emissions of nitrogen oxide nox  so  carbon dioxide so and mercury 
some of these proposals establish nationwide caps and emission rates over an extended period of time 
this national multi pollutant approach to air pollution control could involve significant capital costs that could be material to our financial position or results of operations 
control equipment that will be installed pursuant to the provisions of the clean smokestacks act  cair  camr and cavr  which are discussed below  may address some of the issues outlined above 
cavr requires the installation of best available retrofit technology bart on certain units 
however  the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted 
the following tables contain information about our current estimates of capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations described below 
these costs are eligible for regulatory recovery through either base rates or cost recovery clauses 
the outcome of future petitions for recovery cannot be predicted 
estimated expenditures for the nox sip call rule under section of the clean air act nox sip call include the cost to install nox controls under north carolina s and south carolina s programs to comply with the federal eight hour ozone standard 
the air quality controls installed to comply with the nox sip call and clean smokestacks act will result in a reduction of the costs to meet the cair requirements for our north carolina units at pec 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis

new source review the epa is conducting an enforcement initiative related to a number of coal fired utility power plants in an effort to determine whether changes at those facilities were subject to new source review nsr requirements or new source performance standards under the clean air act 
we were asked to provide information to the epa as part of this initiative and cooperated in supplying the requested information 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
however  the epa has initiated civil enforcement actions against unaffiliated utilities as part of this initiative 
some of these actions resulted in settlement agreements requiring expenditures by these unaffiliated utilities in excess of billion 
these settlement agreements have generally called for expenditures to be made over extended time periods  and some of the companies may seek recovery of the related costs through rate adjustments or similar mechanisms 
the us supreme court has heard arguments  but not yet issued a ruling  related to an appeal of a decision issued by the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit  in a case involving an unaffiliated utility  holding that nsr applies to projects that result in an increase in maximum hourly emissions 
on march   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit set aside the epa s nsr equipment replacement rule 
the rule would have provided a more uniform definition of routine equipment replacement 
the court had earlier set aside a provision in the nsr rule  which had exempted the installation of pollution control projects from review 
the court denied a request by the epa for a re hearing regarding this matter on june  these projects are now subject to nsr requirements  adding time and cost to the installation process 
on november   the epa filed a writ of certiorari petition requesting that the us supreme court review the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit s ruling that vacated the agency s plant renovation exemption for its nsr rule 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
nox sip call rule under section of the clean air act the nox sip call is an epa rule that requires states  including north carolina  south carolina and georgia  to further reduce nox emissions 
the nox sip call is not applicable to florida 
further technical analysis and rulemaking may result in requirements for additional controls at some units 
increased o m expenses relating to the nox sip call are not expected to be material to our or pec s results of operations 
clean smokestacks act in june  the clean smokestacks act was enacted in north carolina requiring the state s electric utilities to reduce the emissions of nox and so from their north carolina coal fired power plants in phases by pec currently has approximately  mw of coal fired generation capacity in north carolina that is affected by the clean smokestacks act 
to meet so 

emission targets  pec is installing devices that neutralize sulfur compounds formed during coal combustion scrubbers on some of its coal fired units 
these devices combine the sulfur in gaseous emissions with other chemicals to form inert compounds  such as gypsum  that are then removed 
in march  pec filed its annual estimate with the ncuc of the total capital expenditures to meet emission targets under the clean smokestacks act by the end of  which were approximately billion to billion at the time of the filing 
currently  the estimate is billion to billion 
the increase in estimated total capital expenditures from the original estimate of million is primarily due to the higher cost and revised quantities of construction materials  such as concrete and steel  refinement of cost and scope estimates for the current projects  and increases in the estimated inflation factor applied to future project costs 
we are continuing to evaluate various design  technology  and new generation options that could further change expenditures required by the clean smokestacks act 
o m expenses will significantly increase due to the additional personnel  materials and general maintenance associated with the equipment 
o m expenses are currently recoverable through base rates 
the clean smokestacks act also freezes the state s utilities base rates for five years  which ends in  unless there are extraordinary events beyond the control of the utilities or unless the utilities persistently earn a return substantially in excess of the rate of return established and found reasonable by the ncuc in the utilities last general rate case 
the clean smokestacks act requires pec to amortize million  representing percent of the original cost estimate of million  during the five year period ending december  the clean smokestacks act permits pec the flexibility to vary the amortization schedule for recording of the compliance costs from none up to million per year 
for the years ended december   and  pec recognized amortization of million  million and million  respectively  and has recognized million in cumulative amortization through december  the remaining amortization requirement of million will be recorded during the one year period ending december  the ncuc will hold a hearing prior to december   to determine cost recovery amounts for and two of pec s largest coal fired generation plants the roxboro no 
and mayo units impacted by the clean smokestacks act are jointly owned 
in  pec entered into an agreement with the joint owner to limit their aggregate costs associated with capital expenditures to comply with the clean smokestacks act and recognized a liability related to this indemnification see note b 
pursuant to the clean smokestacks act  pec entered into an agreement with the state of north carolina to transfer to the state certain nox and so emissions allowances that result from compliance with the collective nox and so emissions limitations set in the clean smokestacks act 
the clean smokestacks act also required the state to undertake a study of mercury and co emissions in north carolina 
the future regulatory interpretation  implementation or impact of the clean smokestacks act cannot be predicted 
clean air interstate rule  clean air mercury rule and clean air visibility rule on march   the epa issued the final cair 
the epa s rule requires the district of columbia and states  including north carolina  south carolina  georgia and florida  to reduce nox and so emissions in order to reduce levels of fine particulate matter and impacts to visibility 
the cair sets emission limits to be met in two phases beginning in and  respectively  for nox and beginning in and  respectively  for so pef has joined a coalition of florida utilities that has filed a challenge to the cair as it applies to florida 
a petition for reconsideration and stay and a petition for judicial review of the cair were filed on july  on october   the district of columbia circuit court issued an order granting the motion for stay of the proceedings 
on december   the epa announced a reconsideration of four aspects of the cair  including its applicability to florida 
on march   the epa denied all pending reconsiderations  allowing the challenge to proceed 
while we consider it unlikely that this challenge would eliminate the compliance requirements of the cair  it could potentially reduce or delay our costs to comply with the cair 
on june   the florida environmental regulation commission adopted the florida cair  which is very similar to the epa s model rule 
pef and other florida utilities are participating in an administrative review of the state adopted rule 
the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted 
on march   the epa finalized two separate but related rules the camr that sets emissions limits to be met in two phases beginning in and  respectively  and encourages a cap and trade approach to achieving those caps  and a de listing rule that eliminated any requirement to pursue a maximum achievable control technology approach for limiting mercury emissions from coal fired power plants 
nox and so controls also are effective in reducing mercury emissions 
however  according to the epa the second phase cap reflects a level of mercury emissions reduction that exceeds the level that would be achieved solely as a co benefit of controlling nox and so under cair 
the de listing rule has been challenged by a number of parties  the resolution of the challenges could impact our final compliance plans and costs 
on october   the epa announced a reconsideration of the camr 
on may   the epa issued a determination confirming the de listing 
sixteen states have subsequently petitioned for a review of this determination 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
states were required to adopt mercury rules implementing the camr by november   which are subject to review and approval by the epa 
a number of states  including north carolina  south carolina and florida  did not meet the deadline for submission to the epa 
the epa has indicated it will defer action 
at december   of the three states in which the utilities operate  all had formally proposed mercury regulations 
the north carolina environmental management commission adopted the proposed rule on november   which is subject to final approval by the north carolina legislature 
north carolina s rule adopts the epa s cap and trade approach and requires the addition of mercury controls by on certain of pec s north carolina units that do not have scrubbers 
pec will have until to provide the agency detailed plans for the installation of controls at existing plants 
south carolina s rule  which was proposed on october   adopts the epa s cap and trade approach and requires that percent of the mercury allowances allocated to each unit be held in a compliance supplement set aside pool 
allowances in the set aside pool may be used by a unit to meet compliance requirements but cannot be traded 
south carolina s rule was adopted on january   and is subject to final approval by the south carolina legislature 
on june   the florida environmental regulation commission adopted the florida camr 
the florida rule adopts the epa s cap and trade approach with changes to the epa s mercury allowance allocations in the rule s first phase 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
on june   the epa issued the final cavr 
the epa s rule requires states to identify facilities  including power plants  built between august and august with the potential to produce emissions that affect visibility in specially protected areas including national parks and wilderness areas 
to help restore visibility in those areas  states must require the identified facilities to install bart to control their emissions 
depending on the approach taken by the states  the reductions associated with bart would begin in cavr included the epa s determination that compliance with the nox and so requirements of cair may be used by states as a bart substitute 
plans for compliance with cair and camr may fulfill bart obligations  but the states could require the installation of additional air quality controls if they do not achieve reasonable progress in improving visibility 
pec s bart eligible units are asheville units no 
and no 
 roxboro units no 
 no 
and no 
 and sutton unit no 
pef s bart eligible units are anclote units no 
and no 
 bartow unit no 
 and crystal river units no 
and no 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
on december   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit decided in favor of the epa in a case brought by the national parks conservation association that alleges the epa acted improperly by substituting the requirements of cair for bart for nox and so 

from electric generating units in areas covered by cair 
pec and pef are each developing an integrated compliance strategy to meet all the requirements of the cair  camr and cavr 
we are evaluating various design  technology  and new generation options that could change pec s and pef s costs to meet the requirements of cair  camr and cavr 
on october   the fpsc approved pef s petition for the recovery of costs associated with the development and implementation of an integrated strategy to comply with the cair  camr and cavr through the ecrc 
on march   pef filed a series of compliance alternatives with the fpsc to meet these federal environmental rules 
at the time  pef s recommended proposed compliance plan included approximately million of estimated capital costs expected to be spent through  to plan  design  build and install pollution control equipment at our anclote and crystal river plants 
on october   pef filed supplemental testimony to inform the fpsc that estimated capital costs for the series of compliance alternatives are likely to increase by approximately percent to percent from the estimates filed in march  primarily due to the higher cost of labor and construction materials  such as concrete and steel  and refinement of cost and scope estimates for the current projects 
these costs will continue to change depending upon the results of the engineering and strategy development work and or increases in the underlying material  labor and equipment costs 
subsequent rule interpretations  equipment availability  or the unexpected acceleration of the initial nox or other compliance dates  among other things  could require acceleration of some projects 
on november   the fpsc approved pef s petition for its integrated strategy to address compliance with cair  camr and cavr 
they also approved cost recovery of prudently incurred costs necessary to achieve this strategy 
north carolina attorney general petition under section of the clean air act in march  the north carolina attorney general filed a petition with the epa  under section of the clean air act  asking the federal government to force coal fired power plants in other states  including south carolina  to reduce their nox and so emissions 
the state of north carolina contends these out of state emissions interfere with north carolina s ability to meet national air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter 
on march   the epa issued a final response denying the petition 
the epa s rationale for denial is that compliance with cair will reduce the emissions from surrounding states sufficiently to address north carolina s concerns 
on june   the north carolina attorney general filed a petition in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit seeking a review of the agency s final action on the petition 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
national ambient air quality standards on december   the epa announced proposed changes to the national ambient air quality standards naaqs for particulate matter 
the epa proposed to lower the hour standard for particulate matter less than microns in diameter pm from micrograms per cubic meter to micrograms per cubic meter 
in addition  the epa proposed to establish a new hour standard of micrograms per cubic meter for particulate matter that is between and microns in diameter pm 
the epa also proposed to eliminate the current standards for particulate matter less than microns in diameter pm 
on september   the epa announced that it is finalizing the pm naaqs as proposed 
in addition  the epa decided not to establish a pm naaqs  and it is eliminating the annual pm naaqs  but the epa is retaining the hour pm naaqs 
these changes are not expected to result in designation of any additional nonattainment areas in pec s or pef s service territories 
on december   environmental groups and states filed a joint petition with the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit arguing that the epa s new particulate matter rule does not adequately restrict levels of particulate matter 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
water quality general as a result of the operation of certain control equipment needed to address the air quality issues outlined above  new wastewater streams may be generated at the affected facilities 
integration of these new wastewater streams into the existing wastewater treatment processes may result in permitting  construction and treatment requirements imposed on the utilities in the immediate and extended future 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
section b of the clean water act section b of the clean water act section b requires cooling water intake structures to reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts 
the epa promulgated a rule implementing section b in respect to existing power plants in july the july rule required assessment of the baseline environmental effect of withdrawal of cooling water and development of technologies and measures for reducing environmental effects by certain percentages 
additionally  the rule authorized establishment of alternative performance standards where the site specific costs of achieving the otherwise applicable standards would have been substantially greater than either the benefits achieved or the costs considered by the epa during the rulemaking 
subsequent to promulgation of the rule  a number of states  environmental groups and others sought judicial review of the rule 
on january   the us court of appeals for the second circuit issued an opinion and order remanding many important provisions of the rule to the epa 
as a result of that decision  our plans and associated estimated costs to comply with section b will need to be reassessed and determined in accordance with any revised or new implementing rule once it is established by the epa 
costs of compliance with a new implementing rule are expected to be higher  and could be significantly higher  than estimated costs under the july rule 
our most recent cost estimates to comply with the july implementing rule were million to million  including million to million at pec and million to million at pef 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
north carolina groundwater standard on september   the north carolina division of water quality ncdwq appeared before the north carolina environmental management commission and recommended the state s groundwater quality standard for arsenic be revised to milligrams liter 
the existing groundwater quality standard for arsenic is milligrams liter 
the north carolina environmental management commission granted approval for ncdwq staff to publish a notice in the north carolina register and schedule public hearings 
the rulemaking process will require at least six months before the standard may be changed 
trace amounts of arsenic are commonly present in coal fly ash sluice water  coal pile runoff  flue gas desulphurization byproducts  and other coal combustion byproducts 
the specific requirements of the rule as finally adopted and associated costs  if any  cannot be predicted 
other environmental matters global climate change the kyoto protocol was adopted in by the united nations to address global climate change by reducing emissions of co and other greenhouse gases 
the treaty went into effect on february  the united states has not adopted the kyoto protocol  and the bush administration favors voluntary programs 
there are proposals and ongoing studies at the state and federal levels to address global climate change that would regulate co and other greenhouse gases 
reductions in co emissions to the levels specified by the kyoto protocol and some additional proposals could be materially adverse to our financial position or results of operations if associated costs of control or limitation cannot be recovered from ratepayers 
the cost impact of legislation or regulation to address global climate change would depend on the specific legislation or regulation enacted and cannot be determined at this time 
we have articulated principles that we believe should be incorporated into any global climate change policy 
while the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted  we are taking voluntary action on this important issue as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship and responsible corporate citizenship 
in a decision issued july   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit denied petitions for review filed by several states  cities and organizations seeking the regulation by the epa of co emissions from new automobiles under the clean air act  holding that the epa administrator properly exercised his discretion in denying the request for regulation 
following denial of a request for rehearing  the petitioners filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the us supreme court  seeking a review of the decision 
on june   the us supreme court agreed to review the decision 
oral argument was held on november  the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
in  we initiated a study to assess the impact of constraints on co and other air emissions and on march   we issued our report to shareholders for an assessment of global climate change and air quality risks and actions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various risks related to changes in market conditions 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we have a risk management committee that includes senior executives from various business groups 
the risk management committee is responsible for administering risk management policies and monitoring compliance with those policies by all subsidiaries 
under our risk policy  we may use a variety of instruments  including swaps  options and forward contracts  to manage exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
such instruments contain credit risk to the extent that the counterparty fails to perform under the contract 
we mitigate such risk by performing credit reviews using  among other things  publicly available credit ratings of such counterparties see note 
the following disclosures about market risk contain forward looking statements that involve estimates  projections  goals  forecasts  assumptions  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
please review item a  risk factors and safe harbor for forward looking statements for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward looking statements made herein 
progress energy  inc 
certain market risks are inherent in our financial instruments  which arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
our primary exposures are changes in interest rates with respect to our long term debt and commercial paper  fluctuations in the return on marketable securities with respect to our nuclear decommissioning trust funds  changes in the market value of cvos  and changes in energy related commodity prices 
these financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
the risks discussed below do not include the price risks associated with nonfinancial instrument transactions and positions associated with our operations  such as purchase and sales commitments and inventory 
interest rate risk from time to time  we use interest rate derivative instruments to adjust the mix between fixed and floating rate debt in our debt portfolio  to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with certain debt instruments  and to hedge interest rates with regard to future fixed rate debt issuances 
the notional amounts of interest rate derivatives are not exchanged and do not represent exposure to credit loss 
in the event of default by a counterparty  the risk in the transaction is the cost of replacing the agreements at current market rates 
we enter into interest rate derivative agreements only with banks with credit ratings of single a or better 
we use a number of models and methods to determine interest rate risk exposure and fair value of derivative positions 
for reporting purposes  fair values and exposures of derivative positions are determined at the end of the reporting period using the bloomberg financial markets system 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities sfas no 
 interest rate derivatives that qualify as hedges are separated into one of two categories cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
cash flow hedges are used to reduce exposure to changes in cash flow due to fluctuating interest rates 
fair value hedges are used to reduce exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate changes 
the following tables provide information at december  and  about our interest rate risk sensitive instruments 
the tables present principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the fixed and variable rate long term debt and florida progress obligated mandatorily redeemable securities of trust 
the tables also include estimates of the fair value of our interest rate risk sensitive instruments based on quoted market prices for these or similar issues 
for interest rate swaps and interest rate forward contracts  the tables present notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates for to and thereafter and the fair value of the related hedges 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the interest rate swaps and the settlement amounts under the interest rate forward contracts

settlement of this obligation did not require the use of working capital in as we had the intent and ability to refinance this debt on a long term basis 
on january   progress energy issued million of senior notes due and million of series a floating rate senior notes due  receiving net proceeds of million 
these senior notes are unsecured 
marketable securities price risk the utilities maintain trust funds  pursuant to nrc requirements  to fund certain costs of decommissioning their nuclear plants 
these funds are primarily invested in stocks  bonds and cash equivalents  which are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and to changes in interest rates 
at december  and  the fair value of these funds was billion and billion  respectively  including million and million  respectively  for pec and million and million  respectively  for pef 
we actively monitor our portfolio by benchmarking the performance of our investments against certain indices and by maintaining  and periodically reviewing  target allocation percentages for various asset classes 
the accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that the utilities regulated electric rates provide for recovery of these costs net of any trust fund earnings  and  therefore  fluctuations in trust fund marketable security returns do not affect earnings 
see note for further information on the trust fund securities 
contingent value obligations market value risk in connection with the acquisition of florida progress  the parent issued million cvos 
each cvo represents the right of the holder to receive contingent payments based on the performance of four synthetic fuels facilities purchased by subsidiaries of florida progress in october the payments  if any  are based on the net after tax cash flows the facilities generate 
these cvos are recorded at fair value  and unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
at december  and  the fair value of these cvos was million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical percent decrease in the december   market price would result in a million decrease in the fair value of the cvos 
commodity price risk we are exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas  coal  fuel oil  electricity and other energy related products marketed and purchased as a result of our ownership of energy related assets 
our exposure to these fluctuations is significantly limited by the cost based regulation of the utilities 
each state commission allows electric utilities to recover certain of these costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines that such costs are prudent 
therefore  while there may be a delay in the timing between when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered from the ratepayers  changes from year to year have no material impact on operating results 
in addition  most of our long term power sales contracts shift substantially all fuel price risk to the purchaser 
we also have oil price risk exposure related to synthetic fuels tax credits as discussed in md a other matters synthetic fuels tax credits 
most of our commodity contracts are not derivatives pursuant to sfas no 
or qualify as normal purchases or sales pursuant to sfas no 
therefore  such contracts are not recorded at fair value 
as discussed in note  on december   our board of directors approved a plan to pursue the disposition of substantially all of pvi s remaining cco physical and commercial assets  and on july   our board of directors approved a plan to divest of gas 
the transaction to sell gas closed on october  we expect to complete the disposition plan for cco in due to the reclassification of the remaining cco operations to discontinued operations in december  management determined that it was no longer probable that the forecasted transactions underlying certain derivative contracts covering approximately bcf of natural gas would be fulfilled 
therefore  these contracts were no longer treated as cash flow hedges and were dedesignated  and cash flow hedge accounting was discontinued 
at december   derivative assets and derivative liabilities related to cco are included in assets of discontinued operations and liabilities of discontinued operations  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   derivative assets and derivative liabilities related to gas and cco are included in assets of discontinued operations and liabilities of discontinued operations  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheet 
for the years ending december   and  excluding amounts reclassified to earnings due to discontinuance of the related cash flow hedges  net gains and losses from derivative instruments related to gas and cco on a consolidated basis were not material and are included in discontinued operations  net of tax on the consolidated statements of income 
for the year ending december   discontinued operations  net of tax includes million in after tax deferred income  which was reclassified to earnings due to discontinuance of the related cash flow hedges 
for the year ending december   there were no reclassifications to earnings due to discontinuance of the related cash flow hedges 
for the year ending december   discontinued operations  net of tax includes million in after tax deferred losses  which were reclassified to earnings due to discontinuance of the related cash flow hedges 
we perform sensitivity analyses to estimate our exposure to the market risk of our derivative commodity instruments  which are not eligible for recovery from ratepayers 
at december   as described above  these derivative commodity instruments are included in discontinued operations 
the following discussion addresses the stand alone commodity risk created by these derivative commodity instruments  without regard to the offsetting effect of the underlying exposure these instruments are intended to hedge 
the sensitivity analysis performed on these derivative commodity instruments uses quoted prices obtained from brokers to measure the potential loss in earnings from a hypothetical percent adverse change in market prices over the next months 
a decrease of percent in the market prices of energy commodities from their december   levels would decrease after tax earnings of discontinued operations by approximately million 
a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in commodity market prices in the near term on our derivative commodity instruments would not have had a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows at december  as discussed above  certain derivative contracts were dedesignated during and cash flow hedge accounting was discontinued  which increased the exposure to potential earnings impacts in the near term from changes in commodity market prices 
the above analysis of our derivative commodity instruments used for hedging purposes does not include the potential favorable impact of the same hypothetical price movement on the physical purchases of natural gas and power to which the hedges relate 
additionally  our derivative commodity portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio  reducing overall risk within set limits 
therefore  the potential impact to earnings of discontinued operations from a hypothetical percent adverse change in commodity market prices would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions  assuming the derivative commodity positions are not closed out in advance of their expected term  continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk  and the anticipated underlying transactions settle  as applicable 
if any of these assumptions ceases to be true  a loss on the derivative instruments may occur 
see note for additional information with regard to our commodity contracts and use of derivative financial instruments 
economic derivatives derivative products  primarily electricity and natural gas contracts  may be entered into from time to time for economic hedging purposes 
while management believes the economic hedges mitigate exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices  these instruments are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and are monitored consistent with trading positions 
we manage open positions with strict policies that limit our exposure to market risk and require daily reporting to management of potential financial exposures 
gains and losses from such contracts were not material to our or the utilities results of operations during the years ended december   and excluding million of derivative assets  which are included in assets of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheet and million of derivative liabilities  which are included in liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheet at december   we did not have material outstanding positions in such contracts at december  and  other than those receiving regulatory accounting treatment at pef  as discussed below 
our discontinued operations did not have material outstanding positions in such contracts at december  pec did not have material outstanding positions in such contracts at december  and pef did not have material outstanding positions in such contracts at december  and  other than those receiving regulatory accounting treatment  as discussed below 
pef has derivative instruments related to its exposure to price fluctuations on fuel oil and natural gas purchases 
these instruments receive regulatory accounting treatment 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded in regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets on the balance sheets  respectively  until the contracts are settled 
once settled  any realized gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause 
at december   the fair values of these instruments were a million long term derivative asset position included in other assets and deferred debits  an million short term derivative liability position included in other current liabilities and a million long term derivative liability position included in other liabilities and deferred credits on the balance sheet 
at december   the fair values of the instruments were a million short term derivative asset position included in other current assets  a million long term derivative asset position included in other assets and deferred debits and a million long term derivative liability position included in other liabilities and deferred credits on the balance sheet 
on january   we entered into derivative contracts to hedge economically a portion of our synthetic fuels cash flow exposure to the risk of rising oil prices over an average annual oil price range of to per barrel on a nymex basis 
the notional quantity of these oil price hedge instruments is million barrels and will provide protection for the equivalent of approximately eight million tons of synthetic fuels production 
the cost of the hedges was approximately million 
the contracts will be marked to market with changes in fair value recorded through earnings from synthetic fuels production 
cash flow hedges our subsidiaries designate a portion of commodity derivative instruments as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
the objective for holding these instruments is to hedge exposure to market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and power for our forecasted purchases and sales 
realized gains and losses are recorded net in operating revenues or operating expenses  as appropriate 
the ineffective portion of commodity cash flow hedges was not material to our or the utilities results of operations for  and the fair values of commodity cash flow hedges at december were as follows progress energy pec pef in millions fair value of assets fair value of liabilities fair value  net our discontinued operations did not have material outstanding positions in commodity cash flow hedges at december  excluded from the table above are million of derivative assets  which are included in assets of discontinued operations  and million of derivative liabilities  which are included in liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheet at december  at december   the amount recorded in our  pec s or pef s accumulated other comprehensive income aoci related to commodity cash flow hedges was not material
