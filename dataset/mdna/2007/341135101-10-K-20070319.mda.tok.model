item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operations general effects of seasonal weather conditions  the timing of rate increases  fluctuations in demand due to the cost of fuel passed on to customers and the migration of winter residents and tourists to florida during the winter season all have an impact on income 
revenues and gross profit summary revenues include cost recovery revenues 
the fpsc allows cost recovery revenues to directly recover costs of fuel  conservation and revenue based taxes in our natural gas and electric segments 
revenues collected for these expenses have no effect on results of operations and fluctuations could distort the relationship of revenues between periods 
gross profit is defined as gross operating revenues less fuel  conservation and revenue based taxes that are passed directly through to customers 
because gross profit eliminates these cost recovery revenues  we believe it provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility revenues 
the following summary compares gross profit between periods and units sold in one thousand dekatherm mdth gas and megawatt hour mwh electric 
revenues and gross profit dollars in thousands year ended december  natural gas revenues cost of fuel and other pass through costs gross profit units sold mdth electric revenues cost of fuel and other pass through costs gross profit units sold mwh propane gas revenues cost of fuel and other pass through costs gross profit units sold mdth consolidated revenues cost of fuel and other pass through costs gross profit natural gas natural gas revenues increased million  or in over primarily due to increased revenue collected for taxes passed directly through to customers 
a change in legislature regarding the calculation of gross receipts tax became effective january   and along with an increase to overall revenues  increased these taxes paid by our customers by approximately  franchise fee revenues also increased by approximately  due to increased rates and area expansion 
natural gas gross profit increased by  or in over we had higher revenue and gross profit in compared to primarily due to billed revenue not exceeding the fpsc allowable earnings as much as in the prior year 
in  we reduced billed revenues and gross profit by our estimate of over earnings of  for the year 
our estimate for was recorded at  in and we reduced that estimate in by  to  the combined effect of this was to increase our revenues and gross profit over the prior year by approximately  other factors contributing to the increase in revenues and gross profit were customer growth and storm surcharge revenues  which became effective november the revenues and gross profit increases were slightly offset by the loss of approximately  of revenue from two customers who went off line for several months to do maintenance work 
natural gas revenues increased million in over primarily due to an million increase in the cost of fuel and other costs that were passed through to customers 
the cost of natural gas increased significantly over prior years  partially as a result of hurricanes and their impact on supplies 
gross profit increased million  or  primarily as a result of rate relief effective in november  normal customer growth and a increase in units sold 
offsetting these increases was the estimated over earnings for of  which reduced revenues and gross profit 
electric electric revenues increased million in over cost of fuel and other costs that were passed through to customers contributed approximately  of the increase 
gross profit increased  or in over the increase in gross profit was primarily due to a slight increase in customer growth and units sold 
electric revenues increased million in over cost of fuel and other costs that were passed through to customers contributed million of the increase 
gross profit increased  or in over the increase in gross profit was primarily due to a increase in units sold along with the rate increases granted in march a large distribution center was built in our northwest division and increased revenues by approximately  and gross profit by approximately  in over propane gas propane revenues increased million  or and gross profit increased  or in compared to revenues increased primarily due to rising fuel costs 
although customers increased by in  the usage per customer declined by contributing to a decrease of in units sold 
warmer weather was the primary reason for this decrease in usage per customer in compared to the increase in gross profit was minimal when compared to last year primarily due to pre buy gains of  realized in but not in propane revenues increased million and gross profit increased million or in compared to the company realized gains of approximately  as a result of buying propane supplies before market price increases 
the remaining increase of from the previous year resulted from propane unit sales increasing due primarily to a growth in residential bulk customers and units sold 
operating expenses operating expenses include operation  maintenance  depreciation  amortization and taxes other than income taxes  and exclude fuel costs  conservation and taxes based on revenues that are directly passed through to customers and recovered in revenues 
operating expenses dollars in thousands year ended december  natural gas electric propane gas total operating expenses natural gas natural gas operating expenses increased  or  in as compared with outside of the normal inflationary impacts on our expenses  customer account expenses increased by  as a result of our customer service focus initiated in based on our strategic plan 
we continued the focus on this area and increased the number of employees in an effort to respond more effectively to customers 
bad debt provision increased  over the prior year primarily due to increasing revenues  aging accounts receivable on several major accounts  and the slowing housing economy 
we increased our collection efforts in the fourth quarter of and will continue to do so in in we had additional increases of  to sales expense resulting from initiatives to boost sales by increasing sales staff 
depreciation expense increased  principally due to construction of mains and new meters to distribute gas to a growing number of new developments in south florida and increasing capacity requirements for existing customers 
natural gas operating expenses increased million or  in as compared with amortization expense increased million 
the bare steel replacement program and recovery of future environmental costs approved in our natural gas rate proceeding were the primary reasons for this increase 
we are currently under a year program to replace all bare steel mains and service lines with coated steel and polyethylene lines 
we have received approval to recover the funds necessary to replace these mains and services over the year period 
pursuant to an fpsc mandate  we accrue an amortization expense as an offset to the revenues received  and record a contribution reducing the related construction expenditures 
the fpsc also approved recovery of our expected environmental liability over a year period 
customer account expense increased  in as compared to primarily due to increased payroll expenses for additional staffing and facility and equipment upgrades 
there were also increased bad debt provisions as a result of the increases in accounts receivable due to general and fuel rate increases 
the purchase of additional safety equipment  tools  hardware and office furniture contributed to a  increase in other operating expense 
other items affecting expenses included a research marketing study to provide us with data to better serve our customers and additional payroll expenses relating to hurricane preparedness and wage increases 
maintenance expense increased by  primarily due to maintenance expenditures in central florida for cleaning and painting a distribution regulator and gate stations and the purchase of maintenance related safety equipment and tools 
electric electric operating expenses increased  or  in as compared with as a result of our efforts to inform and educate our electric customers about the expected and fuel rate increases in upcoming bills  sales expense increased by  customer account expenses increased  in over the prior year mainly due to increased bad debt provisions due to higher sales and slower housing economy 
depreciation expense increased  largely due to major construction work done in the latter part of and the beginning of this included the rebuilding of a transmission sub station  the rebuilding of an entire distribution sub station with two transformers and the replacement of a failed sub distribution station transformer 
additional significant work on transformers is expected in electric operating expenses increased  or  in as compared with as we continued to focus on improving service reliability  we increased maintenance expense by  for additional tree trimming and the use of a temporary mobile substation while a new transformer was purchased and put into service 
depreciation expense increased  due to normal increases in plant assets 
in  other operating expenses increased  due to a shift from work on capital assets to operational needs along with personnel raises 
propane gas propane gas operating expenses increased  or  in as compared with depreciation expense increased  for the addition of plant assets including a propane gas delivery system that will increase the efficiency of our deliveries and improve our overall customer satisfaction 
aging accounts receivable  slowing housing economy and increasing revenues contributed to an increase in our bad debt expense over the prior year 
propane gas operating expenses increased  or  in as compared with as we continued to focus on increasing our propane gas business  other operating costs increased  we placed additional emphasis in the sales area  which resulted in signing up new housing developments that will utilize propane gas 
we incurred increased expenditures for piping homes  delivering propane gas  implementing a new delivery system and increasing commission payments 
this increased effort in our sales area contributed to an increase of customers and overall units sold in our propane gas segment 
administrative expenses administrative expenses increased  or  in over these expenses generally are related to all of our operating segments 
to continue to adequately support our internal and external customers  we increased staffing in our administrative areas 
payroll increases of  related to an increased number of employees  annual pay raises and normal inflationary impacts 
in  we discontinued eligibility to our defined benefit pension plan for new employees and replaced the defined benefit pension plan with a k match plan for new employees 
this change will take time to reduce pension expense  we had an increase of  in our pension expenses in medical costs increased  over the prior year and these costs are expected to continue to rise 
regulatory storm surcharge expenses approved in our natural gas petition increased natural gas expenses by  administrative expenses increased  or  in over pension expense increased  due to our estimate that the return on the pension s assets will not keep pace with growing pension liabilities 
medical insurance premiums continue to rise  increasing  in compliance costs related to sarbanes oxley and internal control requirements  as well as audit fees  increased outside services expenses by  with the impact from our focus on hurricane preparations and the hurricanes  our safety expense increased by  a portion of this increase related to compensation for an additional safety employee and costs for a new safety incentive program 
total other income and deductions other income and deductions include revenues and expenses from sales and installation  service of merchandise  gains or losses on disposal of property  interest expense and other income and expenses 
the largest components of this section are merchandise sales  services income and interest expenses 
our service activities include the installation of merchandise and other contract work 
interest expense consists of interest on bonds  short term borrowings and customer deposits 
merchandise and services revenue and expenses although merchandise and services revenue decreased by approximately  in  the overall profitability in this area increased by  compared to this was primarily a result of significant strategic changes made by management 
these changes included revising the product markup structure  increasing installation fees and increasing employee training 
we experienced a revenue decrease due to lower demand for merchandise as a result of a quiet hurricane season and the slow down of new construction projects in our areas due to the downturn in the housing market 
merchandise and services revenues and expenses increased in from but profitability decreased  we experienced an increase in revenues and cost of sales primarily due to an increased demand for electric to gas conversions and installations of customer owned propane gas tanks to supply back up generators 
we had increased expenses from sub contractors that were not passed on to customers in sales prices 
interest expenses in  total interest expense increased  interest on short term debt increased  this was due to the increase in the average outstanding loan balance on the line of credit and higher interest rates 
interest on customer deposits increased  due to increased customer deposits primarily as a result of additional deposits required after implementing increased rates in our natural gas operation 
other other revenues increased  compared to due to additional interest income associated with the sale of the water assets 
income taxes income tax expense decreased in over the normal tax rate on net income by  this decrease was due to tax return adjustments related to the regulatory deferred tax liabilities 
income tax expense decreased in over the normal tax rate on net income by  tax return adjustments related to the sale of our water assets and the regulatory deferred tax liabilities decreased expenses by  we had an offsetting increase of  related to our irs audit of the and income tax returns 
liquidity and capital resources summary of primary sources and uses of cash dollars in thousands year ended december  sources of cash operating activities  including working capital changes net proceeds on short term debt other sources of cash uses of cash construction expenditures dividends paid net payment on short term debt other uses of cash net use source of cash cash flows operating activities net cash flow provided by continuing operating activities increased in by approximately million compared to fuel and other pass through costs accounted for million of the increase 
this increase resulted from the collection of the prior year s under recoveries of million and over recoveries of million in amounts over recovered will be refunded to customers in subsequent calendar years 
lower fuel costs during the latter part of the year in our natural gas segment contributed to a decrease in receivables and increase in cash of million 
the lower fuel costs and timing of payments to our major fuel suppliers resulted in a decrease to operating cash of million 
income taxes paid increased by approximately  primarily due to the tax effect of the collection of prior year s fuel under recoveries 
net cash flow provided by continuing operating activities decreased in by approximately million compared to payments for fuel exceeded the amount collected from customers by an additional million in the under recovery of fuel costs is collected in the following calendar year 
income tax payments increased approximately million  primarily as a result of less tax depreciation and higher income 
the deduction for tax depreciation was higher in as a result of bonus depreciation  resulting in lower taxes in that year 
we also received a refund in relating to the deferral of the gain on our water assets sale 
offsetting the decreases to cash flow was additional cash received from rate increases in our natural gas segment 
the rate increases also contributed to an increase to accounts receivable of million 
accounts payable increased million in primarily due to the increased cost of fuel in our natural gas segment 
investing activities capital expenditures increased in compared to by approximately  the increase in included expenditures for transportation equipment in our electric segment for approximately  vehicles in our natural gas segment above levels of approximately  and various other typical capital expenditures 
offsetting total increases was a  transformer replacement in capital expenditures decreased in compared to by approximately million 
in  there were large projects to rebuild two substations in our electric segment and additional propane community gas systems costing approximately million 
in such expenditures were lower and consisted of the purchase of a transformer in our electric segment for  a new natural gas mapping system to track our assets used in serving our customers for approximately  a propane delivery system for approximately  additional propane community gas systems for approximately  and other various capital expenditures 
financing activities short term borrowings decreased by million in over recovery of fuel costs provided a large source of cash during as well as the recovery of the prior year s under recovery of fuel costs in  reducing the need for short term borrowings 
although additional sources of cash were provided by our rate increases and lower construction expenditures in  the additional expenditures from the under recovery of fuel costs and additional income taxes increased our short term debt 
short term borrowings increased in over by approximately million 
capital resources we currently have a million line of credit  which expires on july  upon days notice by us we can increase the line of credit to a maximum of million 
the line of credit contains affirmative and negative covenants that  if violated  would give the bank the right to accelerate the due date of the loan to be immediately payable 
the covenants include certain financial ratios 
all ratios are currently met and management believes we are in full compliance with all covenants and anticipates continued compliance 
we reserve million of the line of credit to cover expenses for any major storm repairs in our electric segment and an additional  for a letter of credit insuring propane gas facilities 
as of december   the amount borrowed on the line of credit was million 
the line of credit  long term debt and preferred stock as of december  comprised of total capitalization and debt 
in prior years we periodically paid off short term borrowings under lines of credit using the net proceeds from the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
we may use similar types of proceeds in the future to pay off short term borrowings  dependent on the amount borrowed from the line of credit  prevailing market conditions for debt and equity  the impact to our financial covenants and the effect on income 
our indenture of mortgage and deed of trust  which is a mortgage on all real and personal property  permits the issuance of additional bonds based upon a calculation of unencumbered net real and personal property 
at december   such calculation would permit the issuance of approximately million of additional bonds 
on november  we received approval from the fpsc to issue and sell or exchange an additional amount of million in any combination of long term debt  short term notes and equity securities and or to assume liabilities or obligations as guarantor  endorser or surety during calendar year we will seek approval from the fpsc in for any possible financing in we have million in invested funds for payment of future environmental costs 
we expect to use some of these funds in capital requirements portions of our business are seasonal and dependent upon weather conditions in florida 
this factor affects the sale of electricity and gas and impacts the cash provided by operations 
construction costs also impact cash requirements throughout the year 
cash needs for operations and construction are met partially through short term borrowings from our line of credit 
capital expenditures are expected to be higher in compared to by approximately million 
the primary reason for the expected increase in expenditures is the anticipated purchase of land for a new south florida division office 
the current division office is on environmentally impacted property  which requires relocating the office to allow for clean up of the property 
it is not possible to rebuild at the current location since the property has been rezoned with a residential designation 
the estimated cost of land is million 
we are planning to build and complete this new facility in the next five years 
we do not have any commitments for capital expenditures in other than vehicles of approximately  cash requirements will increase significantly in the future due to environmental clean up costs  sinking fund payments on long term debt and pension contributions 
environmental clean up is forecast to require payments of approximately  in  with remaining payments  which could total approximately million  beginning in annual long term debt sinking fund payments of approximately million will begin in and will continue for eleven years 
based on current projections  we will make voluntary contributions in our defined benefit pension plan of  in and  in required contributions will begin in and are forecast to be approximately million in and based on our current expectations for cash needs  including the possible land purchase and related south florida office construction  we may choose to consider an equity or debt financing in to address those cash needs 
the need and timing will depend upon operational requirements  environmental expenditures  pension contributions and construction expenditures and cannot be precisely predicted at this time 
in addition  if we experience significant environmental expenditures in the next two or three years it is possible we may need to raise additional funds 
if interest rates remain favorable we may consider re financing one of our mortgage bonds 
if refinancing is deemed beneficial  we may re issue the bond for additional principal 
there can be no assurance  however  that equity or debt transaction financing will be available on favorable terms or at all when we make the decision to pro ceed with a financing transaction 
outlook pension and insurance expenses insurance costs have been increasing and are expected to continue to increase while we expect pension costs to decrease 
pension expenses increased  in and our actuarial estimates show pension expense increasing by an additional  in insurance expenses including medical  liability and workers compensation increased  in and are expected to increase further in the regulated segments received rate relief for some of the historical pension and insurance increases in and increases beyond those experienced through  which are allocated to the regulated segments  may require requesting future rate relief 
the propane gas segment may recover these expenses by increasing rates  depending on market conditions in the propane gas industry and the ability to remain competitive 
in an effort to keep pension expenses low  we discontinued eligibility to our pension plan for all new hires 
for new hires not eligible for the defined benefit pension plan  we established an employer match to the employee s contribution to their k plans 
it provided for a company match of for each dollar contributed by the employee  up to of their salary  for a company contribution of up to 
beginning in  for non union employees the plan was enhanced to provide a company match of for the first of an employee s contribution  and a match of for the next of an employee s contribution  for a total company match of up to 
this new enhanced match will be negotiated with our six union contracts during  to be effective on their respective contract date within the employees are eligible for the company match after six months of continuous service  with vesting of after three years of continuous service 
electric power supply contracts contracts with our two electric suppliers were originally set to expire on december  those contracts provided electricity to our customers at rates much lower than market rates 
as part of our negotiations  we agreed to end the current contract terms for our northeast division on december  and executed an amended contract to begin january  and expire december  although the contract rates will increase for  this enabled us to obtain lower rates for the longer term of the contract than would have been available if we had not revised the contract 
the savings are passed through to our customers without profit to us 
we executed a contract for the provider of electricity in our northwest division in december and are seeking approval of this contract and its related terms and conditions from the fpsc on or before july  if the fpsc does not approve this contract  we may need to seek an alternative supplier or new contract with this same supplier for the purchase of electricity in the northwest division 
this contract will be for the purchase of electricity beginning january  we anticipate that contract will result in rates closer to market  which could cause our customers bills to double over existing prices in the next several years 
we are unable to estimate what impact  if any  the higher rates could have on electric consumption 
propane gas we are currently reviewing the possibility of hedging activities in to help mitigate the risk of price changes for our cost of propane gas 
we are unable to determine the impact this activity will have on our future operating income 
we used advance purchase agreements made in the normal course of procuring propane gas supplies in past years 
these agreements resulted in a loss of gross profit of approximately  in and additional gross profit of approximately  in and  in over earnings natural gas segment the fpsc approves rates that are intended to permit a specified rate of return on investment and limits the maximum amount of earnings of regulated operations 
we currently estimate over earnings in of  and in of  we revised our prior year s estimate of  during these liabilities have been included in an over earnings liability on our balance sheet  with the potential of rate refunds to customers 
the calculations supporting these liabilities are complex and involve a variety of projections and estimates before the ultimate settlement of such obligations 
our and estimates of our over earnings liabilities could change upon the fpsc finalization and review of our earnings in and the fpsc determines the disposition of over earnings with alternatives that include refunding to customers  funding storm damage or environmental reserves  or reducing any depreciation reserve deficiency 
in  we requested that the natural gas over earnings be used to provide additional funds to our regulatory storm reserve liability and reduce the costs currently being recovered from our customers through a storm surcharge 
if the fpsc approves this disposition  we will end the storm surcharge in electric customers a large commercial customer in our electric division closed its operations in late as a result we anticipate annual revenues to be reduced by approximately  and annual gross profit to be reduced by approximately  a large distribution center was built in our northwest division in and a second facility was added in a third distribution facility is expected to be added by the end of additional industrial and commercial development is planned for this general area  which should increase load significantly 
additional gross profit is anticipated in the future to increase between  and  as a result of the additional developments 
natural gas customers two natural gas customers went off line for approximately six months in due to lower production  market slow down and maintenance work on their facilities 
we anticipate that they will not be fully operational until mid the decreased revenue and gross profit is estimated to be  in indiantown gas agreement the fpsc approved our joint transportation and territorial agreements with indiantown gas company in october we began construction in the indiantown area to install natural gas mains in the first phase of this development  for approximately homes 
two more developments are slated for construction of approximately  homes in storm preparedness expenses regulators continue to focus on hurricane preparedness and storm recovery issues for utility companies 
newly mandated storm preparedness initiatives could impact our operating expenses and capital expenditures beginning in the initial forecasts of these annual expenditures are approximately  it is possible that additional regulation and rules will be mandated regarding storm related expenditures over the next several years 
we requested that the fpsc allow us to recover the cost of the newly mandated storm preparedness initiatives and to defer these storm related expenditures until we receive recovery through a rate increase 
if approved  both the recovery and expenditures may occur by mid if the fpsc does not approve our request  we plan to file a rate proceeding in as an alternative option for recovery of these expenditures 
land purchase we are currently reviewing multiple sites for the new south florida division office 
we expect to purchase land for the new south florida division office during contractual obligations table of contractual obligations dollars in thousands payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years long term debt obligations long term debt interest operating lease obligations natural gas and propane gas purchase obligations electric purchase obligations other purchase obligations total long term debt obligations the long term debt obligations are principal amounts

operating lease obligations our total operating lease obligation is  we are leasing property from the city of fernandina beach in our northeast division 
the total obligation for the duration of this lease is about  over the next five years 
we lease our appliance showroom in the same division for approximately  annually 
we also have other operating lease agreements with various terms and expiration dates 
purchase obligations a purchase order is considered an obligation if it is associated with a contract or is authorizing a specific purchase of material 
the other purchase obligation amount presented above represents the amount of open orders 
pension  medical postretirement and other obligations our pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations  however  under current actuarial assumptions  contributions may be required as early as current projections indicate that we will make voluntary contributions of  in   in and make required contributions of approximately million in and  decreasing to under million in these payments are not included in the contractual obligations table 
environmental clean up is anticipated to require approximately  in  the remainder to be paid in following years 
these payments are not included in the contractual obligations table 
we have medical postretirement payments relating to retiree medical insurance 
these payments are not included in the contractual obligations table 
estimated future payments are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
dividends we have historically paid dividends 
it is our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends for the foreseeable future 
our dividend policy is reviewed on an ongoing basis by our board of directors and is dependent upon our future earnings  cash flow  financial condition  capital requirements and other factors 
other impact of recent accounting standards financial accounting standard board interpretation no 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
the interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no

the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for calendar years beginning january  we have performed an analysis of tax positions taken and expected to be taken on the tax returns and assessed the technical merits of each tax position by relying on legislation  statutes  common legislative intent  regulations  rulings  and case law and determined that the company has no material uncertain tax positions 
additionally  the irs concluded an audit of the and tax years in september of in february of  the irs informed us that it selected our and tax years for examination 
as our tax positions have remained consistent with those from the previously audited tax years  we are not expecting any material adverse findings as the result of the impending irs audit

the actuarial valuation of the retirement plan obligations has been completed and the recognition provisions of statement at december  resulted in an additional liability for retirement plans 
the tax on the non regulated portion of the liability has been recorded as a deferred income tax asset 
as an offset  the regulatory portion of this liability has been deferred as a regulatory asset retirement plans to be recovered in future rate proceedings and the remaining expense for recording the liability has been included in other comprehensive income

critical accounting policies and estimates regulatory accounting we prepare our financial statements in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation and it is our most critical accounting policy 
in general  sfas no 
recognizes that accounting for rate regulated enterprises should reflect the relationship of costs and revenues introduced by rate regulation 
as a result  a regulated utility may defer recognition of a cost a regulatory asset or recognize an obligation a regulatory liability if it is probable that  through the rate making process  there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in revenues or expenses 
sfas no 
does not apply to our unregulated propane gas operations 
use of estimates we are required to use estimates in preparing our financial statements so they will be in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that the accruals for potential liabilities are adequate 
the estimates in our financial statements included the accrual for pensions  environmental liabilities  over earnings liability  unbilled revenues  allowances for doubtful accounts  uninsured liability claims and the regulatory deferred income tax and deferred income tax liabilities 
pension and post retirement benefits an actuary calculates the estimated pension liability in accordance with fasb  fasb as amended by fasb and fasb environmental liabilities these liabilities are subject to certain unknown future events 
the company reviews the environmental issues regularly with the geologists performing the feasibility studies and their legal counsel specializing in manufactured gas plant issues and negotiates with the environmental regulators and the other participating parties to determine the adequacy of the estimated liability for environmental reserves 
over earnings liability this liability is subject to regulatory review and possible disallowance of some expenses in determining the amount of over earnings 
unbilled revenues unbilled revenue is estimated with certain assumptions including unaccounted for units and the use of current month sales to estimate unbilled sales 
allowances for doubtful accounts this liability is estimated based on historical information and trended current economic conditions  certain assumptions  and is subject to unknown future events 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
uninsured liability claims we are self insured for the first  of each general and auto liability claim and accrue for estimated losses occurring from both asserted and unasserted claims 
the estimate for unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents is based on an analysis of historical claims data and judgment 
regulatory deferred income tax and deferred income tax liabilities these liabilities are estimated based on historical data and are subject to finalization of our income tax return 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
revenue recognition we bill utility customers on a monthly cycle basis  however  the billing cycle periods for most customers do not coincide with the accounting periods used for financial reporting 
we accrue estimated revenue for gas and electric customers for consumption used but not yet billed for in an accounting period 
determination of unbilled revenue relies on the use of estimates and historical data 
we believe that the estimates for unbilled revenue materially reflect the unbilled gross profit for our customers for units used but not yet billed in the current period 
the fpsc approves rates that are intended to permit a specified rate of return on investment and limits the maximum amount of earnings of regulated operations 
any earnings in excess of this maximum amount are accrued for as an over earnings liability and revenues are reduced for this same amount 
the calculations supporting these liabilities are complex and involve a variety of projections and estimates before the ultimate settlement of such obligations 
the fpsc determines the disposition of any over earnings with alternatives that include refunding to customers  funding storm damage or environmental reserves or reducing any depreciation reserve deficiency 
effects of inflation our tariffs for natural gas and electric operations provide for fuel clauses that adjust annually for changes in the cost of fuel 
increases in other utility costs and expenses not offset by increases in revenues or reductions in other expenses could have an adverse effect on earnings due to the time lag associated with obtaining regulatory approval to recover such increased costs and expenses  the uncertainty of whether regulatory commissions will allow full recovery of such increased costs and expenses and any effect on unregulated propane gas operations 
environmental matters we currently use or have used in the past  several contamination sites that are currently involved in pending or threatened environmental litigation as discussed in note contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we intend to vigorously defend our rights in this litigation 
we have insurance and rate relief to cover any expected losses or expenses 
we believe that the aggregate of all future contamination assessment and remedial costs  legal fees and other related expenses would not exceed the insurance proceeds received and any rate relief granted 
the final natural gas rate relief granted by the fpsc provided future recovery of million for environmental liabilities 
the remaining balance to be recovered from customers through future recovery is included on the balance sheet as other regulatory assets environmental 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
forward looking statements cautionary statement this report contains forward looking statements including those relating to the following expectations based on our current expectations for cash needs  including cash needs relating to the possible land purchase and related construction  we may choose to consider an equity or debt financing in to address those cash needs 
the need and timing will depend upon operational requirements  environmental expenditures  pension contributions and construction expenditures and cannot be precisely predicted at this time 
other insurance costs will increase in our anticipation of continued compliance in the foreseeable future with our line of credit covenants 
our expectation that cash requirements will increase significantly in the future due to environmental clean up costs  sinking fund payment on long term debt and pension contributions 
electric storm related expenditures may be necessary beginning in mid and the total cost may be significant 
we may receive recovery for these expenditures 
propane gas hedging activity may occur in the fuel supply contract in our northwest florida division beginning january  will be approved by the fpsc in and will be effective for the purchase of fuel supply beginning in our and over earnings liabilities in natural gas will materialize as estimated after the fpsc reviews and audits 
we expect to have higher fuel costs for  and beyond 
the development in indiantown will occur as estimated 
the purchase of land for our new natural gas and propane gas division office will occur in pension expenses are expected to increase in the fpsc will allow our natural gas over earnings to fund a future storm reserve and reduce our current regulatory asset related to historic storm costs and discontinue the related natural gas storm surcharge in the commercial and industrial growth will occur as expected in our northwest division providing increases in our revenues and gross profit 
the two customers that went off line in will be fully operational by mid these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from what is expressed in such forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those set forth above in risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all financial instruments held by us were entered into for purposes other than for trading 
we have market risk exposure only from the potential loss in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates 
we have no material exposure relating to commodity prices because under our regulatory segments  we are currently fully compensated for the actual costs of commodities natural gas and electricity used in our operations 
any commodity price increases for propane gas are normally passed through monthly to propane gas customers as the fuel charge portion of their rate 
none of our gas or electric contracts are accounted for using the fair value method of accounting 
while some of our contracts meet the definition of a derivative  we have designated these contracts as normal purchases and sales under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
beginning in we plan  on a rolling four quarter basis  to purchase a cap on approximately one third of our forecast propane gas volume purchases and pre buy or hedge with a swap one third of our forecast anticipated propane gas purchases 
the remaining one third will fluctuate with the market price 
our energy strategy allows us to participate in two thirds of price declines but only one third of price increases 
as of december   we have not entered into any hedging activities 
when we do enter into hedging activities  we will determine whether they meet the definition of normal sales and purchases and if not  we will determine whether we can use hedge accounting 
we have no exposure to equity risk  as we do not hold any equity instruments 
our exposure to interest rate risk is limited to investments held for environmental costs  the water sale long term receivable and short term borrowings on the line of credit 
the investments held for environmental costs are short term fixed income debt securities whose carrying amounts are not materially different than fair value 
the short term borrowings were million at the end of december therefore  we do not believe we have material market risk exposure related to these instruments 
the indentures governing our two first mortgage bond series outstanding contain make whole provisions  which are pre payment penalties that charge for lost interest  which render refinancing impracticable 
our non interest bearing long term receivable from the sale of the water operations was discounted at 
a hypothetical basis points increase in the interest rate used would change the current fair value from million to million 
in  a hypothetical basis points decrease in the long term interest rate on million debt excluding unamortized debt discount would change the fair value from million to million 
changes in short term interest rates could have an effect on income depending on the balance borrowed on the variable rate line of credit 
we had short term debt of million on december  and million on december  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in annual earnings for by  and for by  based on year end borrowings
