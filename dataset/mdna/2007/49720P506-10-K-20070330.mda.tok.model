item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us which attempt to advise interested parties of the factors which affect our business  including without limitation the disclosures made under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  under the caption risk factors  and the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report filed on form k 
risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward looking statements  including but not limited to our limited operating history  our history of losses  our dependence on increased acceptance by nonprofit organizations of online fundraising  lengthy sales cycles for major customers  our need to manage growth  risks associated with accounting for and processing large amounts of donations  the rapidly changing technologies and market demands  and other risks identified in this quarterly report on form k 
overview we are an innovative provider of software that enables nonprofit organizations to use the internet to increase donations  reduce fundraising costs  improve operations and build awareness and affinity for their causes by bringing employees  volunteers and donors together in online  interactive communities 
our flagship product  kintera sphere  is managed as a single system and offered to nonprofit organizations as a service accessed with a web browser 
nonprofit organizations pay kintera service fees for access to kintera sphere and transaction based fees tied to the donations and purchases 
although our revenue has increased on a year over year basis  we have experienced significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations in each fiscal period since inception  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
since inception  we have significantly increased our revenue through a combination of factors  including i obtaining new customers  ii expanding existing customer relationships  iii acquiring complementary businesses  iv expanding the features of kintera sphere  v increasing the number and amount of donations we process that result in transaction based fees and vi offering new and improved products and services 
sources of revenue we generate the majority of our revenue from arrangements with nonprofit organizations related to their use of kintera sphere to manage their websites  special events and membership  organize individuals  advocate causes  perform wealth screening  raise major gifts  deliver services and programs and execute personalized marketing campaigns 
we primarily enter into customer contracts for kintera sphere that are one year or more in duration 
our customers pay us upfront fees and monthly service fees for access to kintera sphere  and transaction based fees tied to the donations and purchases we process 
revenue from upfront service fees is deferred and recognized as revenue over the entire term of our contracts 
revenue from transaction processing fees is recognized as they are earned 
we have experienced significant growth with our total online donations processed increasing from million in to million in to million in to million in and million in revenue from service plan and maintenance associated with kintera sphere represented approximately  and of our total net revenue in  and  respectively 
revenue from data and support services represented approximately  and of our total net revenue in  and  respectively 
we also enter into service contracts and implementation contracts related to kintera sphere that are months or longer in duration 
we also generate revenue from our wealth profiling business  which provides a prospect screening tool designed for the fundraising community to find  profile  monitor and dynamically rank the wealth in a nonprofit organization s prospect database 
wealth profiling services are sold in connection with kintera sphere as well as on a stand alone basis 
revenue from the wealth profiling business arise from primarily three sources kintera sphere access or software licensing  post contract support services of the software licenses  and consulting services and related data processing fees 

table of contents our awareness campaign business specializes in melding offline and online strategies and tools to build membership  affinity and impact for nonprofit organizations  political campaigns and unions 
we recognize revenue from the awareness campaign business from primarily four sources kintera sphere access or software licensing  website development and customization  messaging services email fax  and consulting services 
we also generate a material amount of revenue through our fundware business  which we acquired from intuit in december for million in cash 
revenue from this operation is derived from perpetual license fees for the fundware accounting software package  as well as related product support  professional services  outsourced payroll services and transaction fees 
the demand for our services has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including but not limited to  the following economic conditions  the timing or cancellation of significant clients  world events  and seasonality 
for these and other reasons  our net revenue and results of operations in and prior periods may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue and results of operations 
see item a of this annual report for more discussion of factors that could affect our operating results 
our top ten customers generated an aggregate of of our total net revenue for the year ended december  no customer generated greater than of total net revenue in  or cost of revenue and operating expenses cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes salaries  benefits and related expenses of operations and database support and implementation and support services  as well as data costs and amortization of software 
gross profit represents net revenue less the costs of revenue for personnel engaged in database support 
gross profit percentage is highly dependent on contract agreements  donation volume and overhead allocations 
we do not believe that historical gross profit margins are a reliable indicator of future gross profit margins 
as our service and support costs continue to rise due to the increase in services activity relative to our other produce lines  we anticipate that our overall gross margin will decrease 
during the first quarter of  we implemented a new project accounting module that better tracks and records costs associated with each product line and customer 
we anticipate this will improve our visibility into the factors that cause margin fluctuations and in turn our ability to control such factors so as to achieve consistent  sustainable gross margins for each of our major revenue sources 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  compensation expense associated with the adoption of sfas r  benefits and related expenses of personnel engaged in selling  marketing and customer support functions  as well as public relations  advertising and promotional costs 
product development and support expenses 
product development and support expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in engineering  development and quality assurance activities  compensation expense associated with the adoption of sfas r  subcontracting costs and facilities expenses 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  compensation expense associated with the adoption of sfas r  depreciation  legal and other professional fees  facilities and communication expenses and information technology expenditures 
during and  we incurred a significant amount of outside consultant costs and audit fees to comply with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of relating to management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
amortization of purchased intangibles expense 
amortization of purchased intangibles expense excluding amortization of software recorded in cost of revenue consists of costs associated with the acquired intangibles such as contact list  customer files  etc 
that are expensed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of three to five years 
deferred stock based compensation expenses 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees  consultants and in connection with acquisitions during the years ended december  and  we recorded  and million in deferred stock based compensation within stockholders equity  respectively 
these options were considered compensatory because the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock for financial reporting purposes was greater than the exercise prices determined by the board of directors on the date of grant 
the determination of the fair value prior to our initial public offering of the underlying shares of common stock involves subjective judgment and the consideration of a variety of factors  including the prices obtained in private placement transactions of other equity securities  and as a result the amount of the compensatory charge is not based on an objective measure such as the trading price of the common stock since there was no public market for our common stock prior to december  as of december   we had an aggregate of million of deferred stock based compensation remaining to be amortized 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognized beginning on that date included a compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
at december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  all deferred compensation previously recorded and unamortized as of january  has been eliminated with a corresponding reduction in additional paid in capital 
the expense associated with such unamortized deferred compensation balances is included as a component of the expense recognized in accordance with sfas r beginning january  we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions shown in note to the financial statements 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on the history of grants and exercises in our option database 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on both the historical volatility as well as the implied volatility of publicly traded options on our common stock  consistent with sfas no 
r and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
we amortize the fair value on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the awards  which is typically four years 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future or select a different option valuation model altogether  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share in the future 

table of contents acquisitions acquisitions have been an important part of our development and growth to date 
these acquisitions enabled us to expand our service offerings to include wealth profiling and screening services  directed giving programs  accounting software  online grants  consulting and advocacy services 
we may continue to acquire companies that provide us with proprietary technology  access to key accounts  or personnel with significant experience in the nonprofit industry 
during  we completed acquisitions of several complementary businesses including prospect information network pin  carol trevelyan strategy group ctsg  bnw  inc  kindmark  kamtech  inc  giving capital  inc 
and american fundware  inc fundware  and in  we completed the acquisition of gold box  inc gold box 
from time to time  in connection with business acquisitions  we agree to make additional future payments to sellers contingent upon achievement of specific performance based milestones by the acquired entities 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 such amounts are accrued  and therefore  recorded by us as liabilities when the contingency is probable and estimatable and  hence  the additional consideration becomes payable 
in february  we completed the acquisition of pin  which is now part of our wealth screening business 
we issued approximately  shares of restricted common stock subject to vesting ratably over a period of months 
up to  additional shares of common stock were being held in escrow and could be released to the members of pin if the revenue generated from pin s business during the year following the closing of the transaction meets certain targets 
in addition  some of the shares issued to the pin members are being held in escrow to secure the obligations of pin and its members under the purchase agreement 
in the third quarter of  we released  shares of common stock  formerly held in escrow  to the former shareholders of pin upon the achievement of revenue targets 
as a result of the release  we recorded additional goodwill of approximately million 
in the first quarter of  we released  shares of common stock  formerly held in escrow  to the former shareholders of pin upon the achievement of revenue targets 
as a result of the release  we recorded additional goodwill of approximately million 
business enterprise segments in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  we are required to report financial and descriptive information about our reportable operating segments 
we identify our operating segments based on how management internally evaluates separate financial information  business activities and management responsibility 
we operate in one reportable operating segment software and service provider to not for profit organizations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liability at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation expense  goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuation  software development costs and litigation and other loss contingencies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 

table of contents we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment allowance for doubtful accounts  revenue recognition  accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  accounting for software development costs  and accounting for stock based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our clients to make required payments 
we analyze accounts receivable  historical percentages of uncollectible accounts and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we use an internal collection effort  which may include our sales and services groups as we deem appropriate  in our collection efforts 
although we believe that our reserves are adequate  if the financial condition of our clients deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if we underestimate the allowances required  additional allowances may be necessary  which will result in increased expense in the period in which such determination is made 
revenue recognition 
the company derives revenue from fees paid by nonprofit organizations related to the use of kintera sphere as well as from the company s service offerings for wealth profiling and screening  advocacy campaigns and directed giving  from licenses of the company s prepackaged accounting software and from multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists upon contract signing or receipt of an authorized purchase order from the customer  delivery has occurred upon performance of services in accordance with contract specifications  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties credit terms extending beyond twelve months or significantly longer than is customary are deemed not to be fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured there are no indicators of non payment based upon history with the customer and or upon completion of credit procedures 
billings made or payments received in advance of providing services are deferred until the period these services are provided 
if at the outset of an arrangement it is determined that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes due 
if at the outset of an arrangement it is determined that collectibility is not probable  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment 
for arrangements with multiple elements  revenue recognition is based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist in the arrangement 
a delivered item s is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item s has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s and  if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
items are considered to have stand alone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or the customer could resell the item on a stand alone basis 
fair value of an item is generally the price charged for the product when regularly sold on a stand alone basis 
when objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for all units of accounting in an arrangement  arrangement consideration is generally allocated to each unit of accounting based upon their relative fair values 
in those instances when objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered item s but not for the delivered items  the residual method is used to allocate arrangement consideration 
under the residual method  the amount of arrangement consideration allocated to the delivered item s equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered item s 
when the company is unable to establish stand alone value for delivered item s or when fair value of an undelivered item s has not been established  as currently is the case for the upfront payments for activation  maintenance  and use of kintera sphere  a single unit of accounting is deemed to exist and revenue is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the entire term of the arrangement 
when contingent payments are received for the elements the company recognizes these payments over the remaining term of the arrangement 

table of contents to date  the arrangements that contain multiple elements have been contracts that include upfront payments for activation fees received  data screening arrangements  monthly fees for the maintenance and use of the company s software  professional services and transaction fees tied to the donations and purchases that are processed 
revenue associated with the upfront payments is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the entire term of the contract which in general ranges from twelve to thirty six months 
revenue related to monthly maintenance and transaction fees for donations made through the website are recognized as services are provided 
credit card fees directly associated with processing customer donations and billed to customers are excluded from revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf consensus on issue reporting revenue gross as a principal verses net as an agent 
revenue from software licenses and related installation  training and consulting services is recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop license revenue is generally recognized up front upon delivery of the licensed software  with arrangement consideration allocated to the license element using the residual method 
this methodology is used when there is vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for the remaining deliverables and when the remaining services to be provided do not involve the significant production  modification or customization of the licensed software 
if vsoe of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
revenue from postcontract customer support services is recognized separately on a straight line basis over the term of the support period 
vsoe for postcontract customer support services is based on customer renewal rates 
revenue from installation  training and consulting services is generally recognized separately as the services are performed 
vsoe for installation  training and consulting services is based on the normal pricing practices for those services when regularly sold on a stand alone basis 
in order for the installation  training and consulting services to be accounted for separately  sufficient vsoe must exist to permit allocation to the various elements of the arrangement  the services must not be essential to the functionality of any other element of the transaction and the services must be described in the contract such that the total price of the arrangement would be expected to vary as a result of the inclusion or exclusion of the services 
for arrangements with services that are essential to the functionality of the software but do not involve the significant production  modification or customization of the licensed software  the license and related service revenue are recognized upon the latter of the delivery of the license and the completion of the services  with the residual method utilized for the remaining elements in the contract 
if the services involve the significant production  modification or customization of the licensed software  contract accounting is applied to both the software and service elements included in the arrangement in accordance with the provisions of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
to date  license and service revenue recognized pursuant to sop has not been significant 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s product  the company accounts for cash consideration such as sales incentives that is given to customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless the company receives a benefit that can be identified and for which the fair value can be reasonably estimated 
the company also enters into transactions that either exchange advertising for advertising advertising barter or advertising for other products and services non advertising barter 
advertising barter transactions are recorded at the lesser of estimated fair value of the advertising received or given in accordance with the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting for barter transactions 
revenue from barter transactions is recognized when advertising is provided  and services received are charged to expense when used 
revenue for non advertising barter transactions are recognized at the estimated fair value when the advertising spots received under such contracts are either used or sold to third parties 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets require us to make determinations about the value and recoverability of those assets that involve estimates and judgments 
we have made several acquisitions of businesses and assets that resulted in both goodwill and intangible assets being recorded in our financial statements 
we have typically paid most of the acquisition prices in these transactions 
table of contents through the issuance of equity securities 
the value of the equity securities prior to our initial public offering in december was determined through comparison to the issuance prices received in private placement transactions 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization  and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
we evaluate goodwill and other purchased intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
in fiscal  in accordance with sfas no 
 management determined that there was only one reporting unit to be tested 
the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying value of the reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination 
determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions  including projection and timing of future cash flows  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables  and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
it is reasonably possible that the plans and estimates used to value these assets may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
for fiscal  we evaluated goodwill for impairment in both the second quarter and the fourth quarter 
in the second quarter evaluation the discounted cash flows for the reporting unit were based on discrete one year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts were estimated using terminal value calculations 
the median five year compounded annual growth rate of earnings was during the discrete forecast period and the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of and residual growth rates of 
in the fourth quarter evaluation the discounted cash flows for the reporting unit were based on discrete one year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts were estimated using terminal value calculations 
the median five year compounded annual growth rate of earnings was during the discrete forecast period and the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of and residual growth rates of 
we did not recognize any goodwill impairment as a result of performing these tests 
a variance in the discount rate or the estimated revenue growth rate could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and consequently the amount of identified goodwill impairment 
we also assess the impairment of our long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment charge is recognized when the sum of the expected future undiscounted net cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset 
an impairment charge would be measured by comparing the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset being evaluated for impairment 
any resulting impairment charge could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

table of contents accounting for software development costs 
we account for internal use software development costs in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
in accordance with sop  costs to develop internal use computer software during the application development stage are capitalized 
internal use capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related software applications of up to three years and are included in cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the company reviews the software that has been capitalized for impairment on a yearly basis  or otherwise as conditions might arise that would require a review 
for the years ended december   and  the company recognized   and impairment loss for projects terminated  respectively 
the impairment loss is included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations

technological feasibility is attained when software has completed a detail program design for its intended use 
capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related software applications of up to three years and are included in cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we periodically review the software that has been capitalized for impairment 
the company reviews the software that has been capitalized for impairment on a yearly basis  or otherwise as conditions might arise that would require a review

restatement of quarterly condensed consolidated financial statements revenue recognition in connection with the audit of our financial statements for the year ended december  certain errors associated with our recognition of revenue during the first  second and third quarters of were identified 
the errors generally related to contracts and agreements terms made during and were attributable to the integration of offerings from a number of our acquisitions with unique business and operating processes 
the errors  in all cases  represented overstatements of revenue 
the following line items represent revenue related categories that are consistent with the way management classifies its revenues internally and may not be representative of the fair value of those categories as defined by sop and eitf multiple element software agreement without vsoe of fair value for undelivered elements we are party to a contract that provides for multiple software license deliveries based on locations  implementation  training and hardware 
given that we did not have vsoe for the undelivered software licenses we were precluded from recognizing revenue for any of the other elements in the arrangement until such a time as all of the software licenses had been delivered 
we erroneously recognized revenue related to software  hardware and professional services provided to date 
the effect of the related adjustment is to reverse revenue previously recognized and establish such amounts on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
accounting for post contract support pcs agreements at fundware we recognized revenue relating to pcs agreements at our fundware subsidiary that were not renewed 
the effect of the related adjustment is to reverse revenue previously recognized and eliminate the associated accounts receivable against the related deferred revenue balance 
in some cases  we recognized revenue relating to renewed pcs agreements at our fundware subsidiary beginning on the date of the renewal invoice  
table of contents which is typically generated to days in advance of the beginning of the renewal period 
the effect of the related adjustment is to reverse the revenue recognized prematurely and re establish such amounts as deferred revenue 
multi element agreements we record hosting revenues at the inception of the agreement where essential functionality has been established and hosting services are the predominant element of the arrangement 
during  we inappropriately recorded revenues prior to the essential functionality being established or when implementation or other services were significant and hosting services was not considered predominant 
the effect of the related adjustments for arrangements where the implementation services were significant and hosting services were not considered to be the predominant element is to reverse the implementation services revenue until completion of these services and recognize them over the remaining hosting period 
the effect on revenue associated with the arrangement where the implementation services are considered essential to the functionality is to defer the hosting and implementation services until the completion of the implementation services whereby the combination of both the hosting and professional services revenues will be recognized ratably over the remaining term of the hosting arrangement 
wealth screening conversion from software to hosting we recorded the value of revenue associated with the provision of wealth screening data when that data was delivered to the customer in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop consistent with the company s historic practice of providing the customer with a software license of their data 
in we integrated our wealth screening offering with its kintera sphere hosting platform  and provided wealth screening data as part of its on demand hosting model 
this change in our procedures requires that we consider wealth screening to be an element of our multi element hosting agreement  and as such to defer recognition of wealth screening revenue in accordance with the company s accounting procedures for multi element agreements

stock based compensation expenses the following table presents details of stock based compensation expense that is included in each functional line item above  based on the fair value provisions of sfas r for the year ended december  and based on the provision of apb for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands sales and marketing product development and support general and administrative the amounts included in the year ended december  reflect the adoption of sfas r effective january  prior to january   the company accounted for employee stock option plans under the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and related interpretations 
under apb no 
 generally no compensation expense was recorded when the terms of the award were fixed and the exercise price of the employee stock option equaled or exceeded the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of the grant 
additionally  in periods prior to january   the company followed the disclosure only requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas which allowed entities to continue to apply the provisions of apb no 
for transactions with employees and provide pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for employee stock grants made as if the fair value based method of accounting in sfas had been applied to these transactions 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 share based payment revised sfas r and related interpretations which superseded apb no 
sfas r requires that all stock based compensation be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and that such cost be measured at the fair value of the award 
this statement was adopted using the modified prospective method  which requires the company to recognize compensation expense on a prospective basis 
therefore  prior period financial statements have not been restated 
under this method  in addition to reflecting compensation expense for new share based awards  expense is also recognized to reflect the remaining service period of awards that had been included in pro forma disclosures in prior periods 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company accounted for share based payment awards to employees in accordance with apb and related interpretations  and had adopted the disclosure only alternative of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
in accordance with apb  stock based compensation expense was not recorded in connection with 
table of contents share based payment awards granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant  unless certain modifications were subsequently made 
the company recorded deferred compensation in connection with stock options granted  as well as stock options assumed in acquisitions  with exercise prices less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant or assumption in the case of acquisitions 
the amount of such deferred compensation per share was equal to the excess of the fair market value over the exercise price on such date 
recorded deferred compensation was recognized as stock based compensation expense ratably over the applicable vesting periods 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  all deferred compensation previously recorded and unamortized as of january  has been eliminated with a corresponding reduction in additional paid in capital 
the expense associated with such unamortized deferred compensation balances is included as a component of the expense recognized in accordance with fas r beginning january  during  we recorded approximately million of deferred compensation primarily resulting from the stock options granted to employees in excess of the reserve authorized by stockholders 
all grants were authorized effective as of july  the associated stock based compensation expense is being amortized ratably over the vesting period of the underlying stock options of four years 
in addition  in april  we released and accelerated vesting on  shares of common stock  formerly held in escrow  to the former ctsg shareholders upon the fulfillment of certain milestones 
as a result of such vesting  we realized a stock compensation charge of approximately million during the year ended december  in the event that the sum of the gross proceeds from the sale of all shares sold by the former ctsg stockholders prior to march   plus the total value of the unsold shares was less than an aggregate of million such difference  the pro rata shortfall  then we were obligated to pay the former ctsg stockholders an amount equal to the pro rata shortfall 
as of december   we recognized an additional million in compensation expense related to the estimated pro rata shortfall 
on march   we made cash payments to the shareholders in the aggregate amount of million which resulted in an incremental expense of million during the year ended december  in december  we executed a stock option repricing program which resulted in the repricing of certain employee stock options and the acceleration of vesting for certain other employee stock options 
an aggregate of  vested stock options with exercise prices greater than were repriced to the then current market of and vesting was accelerated on  options 
we recorded  as compensation expense relating to the repricing of stock options for the difference between the effective date stock prices of and the market price on december  of 
the value on the  re priced stock options as of december  was determined to be million 
in may the board of directors approved the kintera stock option exchange program whereby eligible employees were offered the opportunity to exchange certain vested options to purchase shares of the company s common stock  par value per share  with an exercise price per share greater than  that were outstanding under the plan  the plan and the plan the eligible options 
in exchange for the eligible options  tendering option holders received new options the replacement options to purchase shares of common stock 
the replacement options were issued under the plan 
the number of shares subject to a replacement option was the same number of vested shares of common stock that an eligible employee tendered pursuant to a current eligible option 
all replacement options were granted with an exercise price equal to of the closing price of the company s common stock on june  each replacement option was entirely unvested on the grant date and vests pro rata on a daily basis over the two year period beginning june  each replacement option maintained the original term and expiration date of the eligible option which was cancelled in exchange for the replacement option 
the exchange was accounted for as a modification in accordance with the provisions of fas r and accordingly the company will recognize the additional compensation cost of million which equals the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before its terms were modified with such additional compensation cost being recorded over the two year vesting period of the modified award 

table of contents the amount of unearned stock based compensation amounted to million at december   and will be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
if there are any additional modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
future stock based compensation expense and unearned stock based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions

terms with individual customers vary greatly  however  we typically require thirty day terms from our customers 
our receivables can vary dramatically due to overall sales volumes and due to quarterly variations in donations processed and timing of implementation of services and receipts from large customers and the timing of contract payments

we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and anticipated operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our planned working capital requirements and contractual commitments for at least the next months

three months ended march  june  september  december  in thousands cash used in provided by operating activities while we have improved our cash flow  at our current revenue and expense levels we will continue to be a user of cash 
if we are unable to increase our revenue and substantially decrease our expenses  we will need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs 
we may need additional financing earlier than we anticipate 
if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock 
we may also decide to issue securities  including debt securities  which have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all 
if future financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to fund our future needs 
this may prevent us from increasing our market share  capitalizing on new business opportunities or remaining competitive in our industry 
we currently do not believe we have any variable interest entities 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons
