management believes that the company has positioned itself for continued success with the combination of a strong capital base  a commitment to provide exceptional customer service  and a commitment to maintain the technology necessary to provide its customers with easy access to the financial products and services offered by the bank 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contains a summary of the company s significant accounting policies 
management believes the company s policy with respect to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
changes in these judgments  assumptions or estimates could materially impact results of operations 
this critical policy and its application is periodically reviewed with the audit committee and the board of directors 
the provision for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance  including an assessment of known and inherent risks in the portfolio  giving consideration to the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  level of delinquencies  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  the existence and estimated net realizable value of any underlying collateral and guarantees securing the loans  and current economic and market conditions 
although management uses the best information available to it  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
furthermore  the majority of the company s loans are secured by real estate in the state of new jersey 
accordingly  the collectibility of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the company s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in local market conditions and may be adversely affected should real estate values decline or the central new jersey area experience an adverse economic shock 
future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond the company s control 
results of operations the company reported record earnings of  or per share diluted  for the year ended december  compared to  or per share diluted  in net income and diluted earnings per share grew and  respectively  for the year ended december  the company posted net income of  or per share diluted  for the year ended december  all share information has been restated for the effect of a stock dividend declared on december  and paid on january  to shareholders of record on january  net interest income net interest income  the company s largest and most significant component of operating income  is the difference between interest and fees earned on loans and other earning assets  and interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
this component represented of the company s net revenues for the year ended december  net interest income also depends upon the relative amount of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
the following tables set forth the company s consolidated average balances of assets and liabilities and shareholders equity as well as interest income and expense on related items  and the company s average yield or rate for the years ended december   and the average rates are derived by dividing interest income and expense by the average balance of assets and liabilities  respectively

for the purpose of calculating loan yields  average loan balances include nonaccrual loans with no related interest income 
the interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
tax equivalent basis 
changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction between the volume and composition of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  related yields  and associated funding costs 
the rate volume table demonstrates the impact on net interest income of changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in interest rates earned and paid 
the company s net interest income increased on a tax equivalent basis by  or  to  for the year ended december   from the  reported for the year ended december  as indicated in the rate volume table  the principal factor contributing to the increase in net interest income was an increase in the interest income of  resulting from increased balances in the loan portfolio components 
this was partially offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from increases in the rates paid on deposit components

service charge income decreased in principally due to management s actions to restructure service charges and fees based on the results of a comparative study of market fees performed in early during  new fees were assessed on accounts overdrawn for drawing on uncollected funds and for processing incoming wire transfers 
service charge income decreased in as a result of the bank waiving service charges on new accounts during the period of branch expansion  and a decreasing number of accounts subject to service charges 
management continues to utilize a strategy of requiring compensating balances from its commercial customers 
those who meet balance requirements are not assessed service charges 
gains on sales of loans held for sale decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  gains on sales of loans held for sale totaled  in market interest rates on year fixed rate mortgages fell consistently during  and into the first half of consumer refinance of home loans  which  along with a strong housing market  led to the bank achieving high levels in mortgage origination volumes and mortgage loan sale gains  as newly originated loans were sold at higher than normal spreads due to the consistently lower level of market interest rates 
the rising rate environment that evolved during late and continued throughout the first half of has significantly impacted the mortgage market and resultant secondary loan sales for as long term rates have increased 
non interest income also includes income from bank owned life insurance boli which amounted to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the bank purchased million in tax free boli assets in and million in  which partially offset the cost of employee benefit plans and reduced the overall effective tax rate 
the bank also generates non interest income from a variety of fee based services 
these include safe deposit rentals  wire transfer service fees and automated teller machine fees for non customers 
deposit and service fee charges are reviewed and adjusted as needed from time to time by management to reflect current costs incurred by the bank to offer the products or services and prices charged by competitor financial institutions amid the bank s competitive market 
the company recorded net losses on sales of securities available for sale of  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the company recorded net gains on sales of securities available for sale of  in these portfolio transactions in  and were primarily the result of modest portfolio restructurings 
their purpose was to improve the company s longer term interest rate risk position 
non interest expenses non interest expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  non interest expenses in increased to  from  in the largest increase in non interest expenses for compared to was in salaries and employees benefits 
to a lesser extent  occupancy  and other non interest expenses also reflect increases for the comparable periods 
the largest increase in non interest expenses in compared to was in salaries and employee benefits and  to a lesser extent  other non interest expenses  as indicated in the table below 
the following table presents the major components of non interest expenses for the years through non interest expenses salaries and employee benefits occupancy expense equipment expense marketing date processing services regulatory  professional and other fees office expense all other expenses total salaries and employee benefits  which represent the largest portion of non interest expenses  increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to a increased staffing levels for all of as a result of the opening of two new branch locations b normal employee salary increases 
these expenses increased in by  or  over the  reported for the increase in the level of salaries and employee benefits for versus reflects the increase in staffing levels due to the branch expansion program plus normal salary increases 
salaries and employee benefits as a percentage of average assets were for  for and for as the result of the adoption by the company as of january  of financial accounting standards board statement no

this expanded location allows the bank to offer drive through banking plus atm services that were not available at the previous location 
the current period increase in occupancy costs is primarily attributable to this branch relocation project 
in addition  the relocation and expansion of our fort lee loan production office to a full service branch of the bank was completed in early november certain costs related to this relocation have been incurred prior to the actual opening of this branch 
the occupancy expense component of total non interest expense as a percentage of average assets was for the year ended december   for the year ended december  and for the year ended december   respectively 
data processing service expense increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  as the company incurred operating costs to bring the two new branch locations online during as well upgrading existing systems throughout the year 
the bank s ratio of non interest expense to average assets has remained consistently favorable at for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  an important industry productivity measure is the efficiency ratio 
the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total operating expenses by net interest income and other income 
an increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same or greater volume of income  while a decrease would indicate a more efficient allocation of resources 
the bank s efficiency ratio decreased for the year ended december  to compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  financial condition cash and cash equivalents at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  compared to  at december  cash and cash equivalents at december  consisted of cash and due from banks of  and federal funds sold short term investments of  the corresponding balances at december  were  and  respectively

loans the loan portfolio  which represents the bank s largest asset  is a significant source of both interest and fee income 
elements of the loan portfolio are subject to differing levels of credit and interest rate risk 
the bank s primary lending focus continues to be construction loans wholesale and retail  commercial loans  owner occupied commercial mortgage loans and tenanted commercial real estate loans 
total loans averaged  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  compared to an average of  for the year ended december  growth in the average loan portfolio balance was generated primarily by an increase of  or  in construction loans 
at december   total loans amounted to  compared to  at december   an increase of  or 
the average yield earned on the loan portfolio was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   an increase of basis points 
this increase is primarily due to the rising interest rate environment that evolved during the last half of and continued throughout the first half of the following table represents the components of the loan portfolio for the dates indicated 
december  amount amount amount amount amount construction loans residential real estate loans commercial and commercial real estate loans loans to individuals lease financing deferred loan fees all other loans total the rising interest rate environment that existed throughout the first half of  especially the rising average prime rate  and competitive loan pricing resulted in the increased portfolio components discussed in the following paragraphs 
commercial and commercial real estate loans averaged  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  commercial loans consist primarily of loans to small and middle market businesses and are typically working capital loans used to finance inventory  receivables or equipment needs 
these loans are generally secured by business assets of the commercial borrower 
the average yield on the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio increased basis points to for from for construction loans averaged  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  generally  these loans represent owner occupied or investment properties and usually complement a broader commercial relationship between the bank and the borrower 
construction loans are structured to provide for advances only after work is completed and inspected by qualified professionals 
the average yield on the construction loan portfolio increased basis points to for from for residential loans averaged  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  these loans consist primarily of residential mortgage loans secured by residential real estate 
the average yield on this portfolio increased basis points to for from for the following table provides information concerning the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s commercial and commercial real estate loans and construction loans at december  maturity range type within one year after one but within five years after five years total commercial commercial real estate construction total fixed rate loans floating rate loans total non performing assets non performing assets consist of non performing loans and other real estate owned 
non performing loans are composed of loans on a non accrual basis  loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest and principal payments but have not been classified as non accrual  and loans whose terms have been restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest on principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
the bank s policy with regard to non accrual loans is that generally  loans are placed on a non accrual status when they are days past due unless these loans are well secured and in the process of collection or  regardless of the past due status of the loan  when management determines that the complete recovery of principal or interest is in doubt 
consumer loans are generally charged off after they become days past due 
subsequent payments on loans in non accrual status are credited to income only if collection of principal is not in doubt 
non performing loan increased by  to  at december  from  at december  this increase is primarily due to an increase of  in non accrual loans to  at december  compared to  at december  the increase in non accrual loans is primarily related to the bank s construction lending activities totaling  being designated as non accrual 
the largest segment of the increase represents unfinished residential construction where litigation has been commenced and work out negotiations are in process 
the balance of the non performing loans are centered in completed residential and commercial properties which are in foreclosure 
the table below sets forth non performing assets and risk elements in the bank s portfolio by type for the years indicated 
as the table demonstrates  non performing loans to total loans increased to at december  from at december  for the reasons previously stated  but loan quality is still considered to be strong 
this was accomplished through quality loan underwriting  a proactive approach to loan monitoring and aggressive workout strategies 
non performing assets increased by  to  at december  from  at december  non performing assets represented of total assets at december  and at december  non performing loans as a percentage of total loans were at december   compared to at december  the bank had no loans classified as restructured loans at december  or at december   the bank had no loans that were days or more past due but still accruing interest income compared to of loans in this category of non performing loans at december  management s decision to accrue income on these loans was based on the level of collateral and the status of collection efforts 
non performing assets and loans non performing loans loans days or more past due and still accruing non accrual loans total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total assets management takes a proactive approach in addressing delinquent loans 
the company s president meets weekly with all loan officers to review the status of credits past due ten days or more 
an action plan is discussed for each of the loans to determine the steps necessary to induce the borrower to cure the delinquency and restore the loan to a current status 
also  delinquency notices are system generated when loans are five days past due and again at days past due 
in most cases  the company s collateral is real estate and when the collateral is foreclosed upon  the real estate is carried at the lower of fair market value less estimated selling costs  or at cost 
the amount  if any  by which the recorded amount of the loan exceeds the fair market value of the asset is a loss which is charged to the allowance for loan losses at the time of foreclosure or repossession 
resolution of a past due loan can be delayed if the borrower files a bankruptcy petition because collection action cannot be continued unless the company first obtains relief from the automatic stay provided by the bankruptcy code 
allowance for loan losses and related provision the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses in the loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation reserve available for losses incurred or inherent in the loan portfolio and other extensions of credit 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of the company 
the company s primary lending emphasis is the origination of commercial and commercial real estate loans including construction loans 
based on the composition of the loan portfolio  the primary risks inherent in it are deteriorating credit quality  increases in interest rates  a decline in the economy  and a decline in new jersey real estate market values 
any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect the loan portfolio and may result in increased delinquencies  loan losses and increased future provision levels 
all or part of the principal balance of commercial and commercial real estate loans  and construction loans are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all  or part  of the principal balance is highly unlikely 
consumer loans are generally charged off no later than days past due on a contractual basis  earlier in the event of bankruptcy  or if there is an amount deemed uncollectible 
because all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan and lease losses 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for loan and lease losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is adequate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses 
the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses consists of several key elements 
these elements include a specific reserve for doubtful or high risk loans  an allocated reserve  and an unallocated portion 
the company consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology 
during the quarterly review of the allowance for loan and lease losses  the company considers a variety of factors that include general economic conditions 
trends in charge offs 
trends and levels of delinquent loans 
trends and levels of non performing loans  including loans over days delinquent 
trends in volume and terms of loans 
levels of allowance for specific classified loans 
credit concentrations 
the specific reserve for high risk loans is established for specific commercial loans  commercial real estate loans  and construction loans which have been identified by management as being high risk loan assets 
these high risk loans are assigned a doubtful risk rating grade because the loan has not performed according to payment terms and there is reason to believe that repayment of the loan principal in whole  or part  is unlikely 
the specific portion of the allowance is the total amount of potential unconfirmed losses for these individual doubtful loans 
to assist in determining the fair value of loan collateral  the company often utilizes independent third party qualified appraisal firms which in turn employ their own criteria and assumptions that may include occupancy rates  rental rates  and property expenses  among others 
the second category of reserves consists of the allocated portion of the allowance 
the allocated portion of the allowance is determined by taking pools of loans outstanding that have similar characteristics and applying historical loss experience for each pool 
this estimate represents the potential unconfirmed losses within the portfolio 
individual loan pools are created for commercial and commercial real estate loans  construction loans  and for the various types of loans to individuals 
the historical estimation for each loan pool is then adjusted to account for current conditions  current loan portfolio performance  loan policy or management changes  or any other factor which may cause future losses to deviate from historical levels 
the company also maintains an unallocated allowance 
the unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions which may cause a potential loan loss but are not specifically identifiable 
it is prudent to maintain an unallocated portion of the allowance because no matter how detailed an analysis of potential loan losses is performed  these estimates by definition lack precision 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
at december   management believed that the allowance for loan losses and non performing loans was adequate 
while management uses the best information available to make such evaluations  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the table below presents  for the years indicated  an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and other related data

the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans was at december   compared to at december  management believes the quality of the loan portfolio remains strong and that the allowance for loan losses is adequate in relation to credit risk exposure levels 
the provision for loan losses was  and  respectively  for the years ended december  and management considers a complete review of the following specific factors in determining the provision for loan losses historical losses by loan category  non accrual loans  problem loans as identified through internal classifications  collateral values  and the growth and size of the portfolio 
in addition to these factors  management takes into consideration current economic conditions and local real estate market conditions 
the increase in the provision for the year ended december  was primarily due to inherent risk related to loan growth and increased watch list loans 
management believes the quality of the loan portfolio remains sound  the determination of the provision for loan losses amount was primarily due to the manageable balances in non accrual loans and management s assessment of economic conditions in the bank s marketplace 
the following table describes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among the various categories of loans and certain other information as of the dates indicated 
the allocation is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which future losses may occur

liquidity liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
liquidity management refers to the company s ability to support asset growth while satisfying the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers 
in addition to maintaining liquid assets  factors such as capital position  profitability  asset quality and availability of funding affect a bank s ability to meet its liquidity needs 
on the asset side  liquid funds are maintained in the form of cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold  investment securities held to maturity maturing within one year  securities available for sale and loans held for sale 
additional asset based liquidity is derived from scheduled loan repayments as well as investment repayments of principal and interest from mortgage backed securities 
on the liability side  the primary source of liquidity is the ability to generate core deposits 
short term borrowings are used as supplemental funding sources when growth in the core deposit base does not keep pace with that of earnings assets 
the bank has established a borrowing relationship with the fhlb and a correspondent bank which further supports and enhances liquidity 
at december   the bank maintained an overnight line of credit at the fhlb in the amount of  plus a one month overnight repricing line of credit of  advances issued under these programs are subject to fhlb stock level and collateral requirements

the securities portfolios are also a source of liquidity  providing cash flows from maturities and periodic repayments of principal 
for the year ended december   prepayments and maturities of investment securities totaled  another source of liquidity is the loan portfolio  which provides a flow of payments and maturities 
interest rate sensitivity analysis the largest component of the bank s total income is net interest income  and the majority of the bank s financial instruments are composed of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities with various terms and maturities 
the primary objective of management is to maximize net interest income while minimizing interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is derived from timing differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities  loan prepayments  deposit withdrawals  and differences in lending and funding rates 
management actively seeks to monitor and control the mix of interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the following tables set forth certain information relating to the bank s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity or repricing and the fair value of such instruments at december  interest rate sensitivity analysis at december  in thousands interest sensitivity period total within one year one year to two years non interest sensitive and over two years total day day day day earning assets total investment securities loans other interest earning assets source of funds savings and time deposits other interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing sources asset liability sensitivity gap period gap cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets the bank continually evaluates interest rate risk management opportunities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
management believes that hedging instruments currently available are not cost effective  and therefore has focused its efforts on increasing the bank s spread by attracting lower costing retail deposits 
in addition to utilizing the gap ratio for interest rate risk assessment  management utilizes simulation analysis whereby the model estimates the variance in net income with a change in interest rates of plus or minus basis points over and month periods 
given recent simulations  net interest income would be within policy guidelines regardless of the direction of market rates 
recent accounting pronouncements in february   the fasb issued sfas no

sfaf amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas and permits fair value re measurement for any hybrid financial instrument with an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation  provided that the whole instrument is accounted for on a fair value basis 
prior to fair value measurement  interests in securitized financial assets must be evaluated to identify interests containing embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation 
the amendments to sfas also clarify which interest only and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas  and that concentration of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives 
sfas amends sfas to allow a qualifying special purpose entity to hold a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk analysis to measure the impacts of longer term asset and liability mismatches beyond two years  the company utilizes modified duration of equity and economic value of portfolio equity evpe models 
the modified duration of equity measures the potential price risk of equity to changes in interest rates 
a longer modified duration of equity indicates a greater degree of risk to rising interest rates 
because of balance sheet optionality  an evpe analysis is also used to dynamically model the present value of asset and liability cash flows  with rates ranging up or down basis points 
the economic value of equity is likely to be different as interest rates change 
results falling outside prescribed ranges require action by management 
at december  and  the company s variance in the economic value equity as a percentage of assets with an instantaneous and sustained parallel shift of basis points is within the negative guideline  as shown in the tables below 
the market capitalization of the company should not be equated to the evpe  which only deals with the valuation of balance sheet cash flows using conservative assumptions 
calculated core deposit premiums may be less than what is available in an outright sale 
the model does not consider potential premiums on floating rate loan sales  the impact of overhead expense  non interest income  taxes  industry market price multiples and other factors reflected in the market capitalization of a company
