overview innotrac  founded in and headquartered in atlanta  georgia  is a full service fulfillment and logistics provider serving enterprise clients and world class brands 
the company employs sophisticated order processing and warehouse management technology and operates ten fulfillment centers and two call centers in seven cities spanning all time zones across the continental united states 
prior to  the company was primarily focused on the telecommunications industry  with over of its revenues being derived through this vertical 
today  the company is primarily focused on five diverse lines of business  or industry verticals 
this is a result of a significant effort made by the company to diversify both its industry and client base over the past several years 
key economic factors was driven by the commencement of services to new clients  including clients from the acquisition of the fulfillment and reverse logistics business of clientlogic  and target 
com  a division of target corporation 
the company recorded net losses of million during the year ended december  contributing to the net losses were higher than anticipated start up costs associated with the implementation of new clients and transition and start up costs associated with the clientlogic acquisition 
in addition  variable labor costs exceeded expectation as more labor was required to handle the larger than expected volumes 
the financial results of the fourth quarter in particular were adversely impacted by the ramping up and implementation costs associated with these new clients  as the fourth quarter net loss was million 
the company chose to forego short term profits in order to timely fulfill the increased volume of orders and maintain client satisfaction  and as a result experienced increased revenue but at a higher variable cost 
without the new clients  revenues would have decreased by approximately million as compared to  but the net loss would have been approximately million less than was actually incurred 
as a result of higher than anticipated losses  the company was not in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio in our revolving credit agreement at december  however on april   the company and wachovia bank entered into a second waiver and amendment agreement the second waiver agreement whereby the bank agreed to waive the company s then existing defaults under the credit agreement  which included failure to maintain the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  failure to make a certain deferred purchase payment and failure to deliver certain financial information as required by the credit agreement  provided that the company comply with the terms of the credit agreement  as amended  and the additional conditions of the second waiver agreement

on october   the company acquired the fulfillment and reverse logistics business of clientlogic  located in columbus  ohio  for million which includes estimated payments equal to ten percent of net revenues of the acquired business for a twelve month period beginning on april   totaling million 
the acquisition will be funded from the company s revolving credit facility  reducing the availability under the credit facility 
the acquisition added several large clients consistent with our existing business lines and complementary to our core competencies 
the majority of the clients acquired have long standing relationships with the operation in the columbus facility and we anticipate that the relationships will continue 
in the fourth quarter  the clients acquired from the clientlogic business contributed approximately million in revenue 
on a pro forma basis  the clients would have contributed million in revenue for the year ended december  the information on which we have based this pro forma information was provided by the seller but not independently verified by innotrac 
the purchased business was not accounted for on a stand alone basis by clientlogic  as clientlogic operated the purchased business as a group of departments within its overall operations

com  which started late in the second quarter of  and the additional revenue from the clientlogic acquisition in october we anticipate that the percentage of our revenues attributable to our direct marketing clients will increase during due to the addition of several new clients  including those relating to the clientlogic acquisition  and additional revenues from existing clients due to increased volumes 
revenues attributable to our direct marketing clients increased in the first half of due to a highly successful new product introduced by one of our newer direct marketing clients  but weakened considerably in the second half as that product matured and the client s advertising for that product was reduced 
on october   tactica international  inc tactica  one of the company s former direct response clients  filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter in us bankruptcy court 
on october  the bankruptcy court approved  on an interim basis  a stipulation and consent order stipulation entered into between tactica and innotrac 
this stipulation allowed tactica to continue to sell its inventory while reducing the receivables owed by tactica to innotrac 
tactica defaulted on the stipulation and in march  innotrac and tactica reached a verbal agreement that would permit innotrac to liquidate the tactica inventory in order to pay down the receivable balance  with any excess proceeds to be remitted to tactica 
on june   the bankruptcy court approved the agreement among innotrac  tactica and the creditor s committee on the terms of the liquidation and an additional amount of the proceeds to be remitted to the unsecured creditors of tactica 
based on the stipulation and an appraisal performed by a third party independent appraiser  the reserve associated with the tactica receivable was decreased from million at june  to million at september  the reserve was further reduced to million at december  based on the verbal agreement reached with tactica regarding the liquidation of its inventory 
based on the approved agreement and management s estimate of the net realizable value of the inventory  the reserve associated with the tactica receivable was further reduced from million to  at march  in the fourth quarter  the reserve associated with the tactica receivable was increased to million 
the additional reserve was based on management s estimate of the net realizable value of the inventory  which was considerably reduced in the fourth quarter as a result of buyers not materializing as initially indicated by the third party independent appraiser and a continuing reduction in value of the merchandise 
the liquidation was completed and the receivable written off against the reserve during the second quarter of telecommunications and modems 
the company continues to be a major provider of fulfillment and customer support services to the telecommunications industry 
inventory for our telecommunications and dsl clients is held on a consignment basis  with the exception of certain bellsouth at t inventory  for which we are contractually indemnified  and includes items such as telephones  caller id equipment and dsl modems and ancillary equipment 
due to a decline in our telecommunications business as a result of reduced volumes due to the maturity of the telephone and caller id equipment business and an increase in revenues generated from our retail  catalog and direct marketing clients  we anticipate that the percentage of our revenues attributable to telecommunications and dsl clients will decline during  despite increased volumes from our dsl modem business  which is still in a strong growth mode

payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases clientlogic acquisition additional payments critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and demand the most significant use of subjective estimates and management judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
specific risks inherent in our application of these critical policies are described below 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
these policies often require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
additional information concerning our accounting policies can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the policies that we believe are critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below reserve for uncollectible accounts 
the company makes estimates each reporting period associated with its reserve for uncollectible accounts 
these estimates are based on the aging of the receivables and known specific facts and circumstances 
goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
goodwill represents the cost of an acquired enterprise in excess of the fair market value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january   which changed the accounting for goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
innotrac s goodwill carrying amount as of december  and was million 
this asset relates to the goodwill associated with the company s acquisition of universal distribution services uds in december including the earnout payment made to the former uds shareholders in february and the acquisition of ifulfillment  inc in july in accordance with sfas no 
 the company contracted with an independent third party valuation firm to perform a valuation in the first quarter of the third party valuation supported that the fair value of the reporting unit at january  exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets  including goodwill  and thus no impairment currently exists 
management has reviewed and concurs with the major assumptions used in the third party s valuation at january  the company will perform this impairment test annually as of january or sooner if circumstances dictate 
accounting for income taxes 
innotrac utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if the company considers it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
innotrac s gross deferred tax asset as of december  is million 
this deferred tax asset was generated primarily by net operating loss carryforwards created primarily by the special charge of million recorded in and the net losses generated in   and innotrac has a tax net operating loss carryforward of million at december  that expires between and innotrac s ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  collection of existing outstanding accounts receivable  competitive pressures on sales and margins and other factors beyond management s control 
these factors  combined with losses in recent years  create uncertainty about the ultimate realization of the gross deferred tax asset in future years 
therefore  a valuation allowance of approximately million and million has been recorded as of december  and  respectively 
income taxes associated with future earnings will be offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance 
for the year ended december   the deferred income tax benefit of million was offset by a corresponding increase of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
when  and if  the company can return to consistent profitability and management determines that it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration  the valuation allowance can be reduced or eliminated 
accounting estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates

the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement
