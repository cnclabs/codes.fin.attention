the lower sales in were primarily driven by milder weather compared to earnings in also reflect higher operating and maintenance expenses and interest costs 
partially offsetting these factors was an increase in electric distribution rates in for unitil s utility subsidiary in new hampshire and increased gas delivery sales under a new contract with a large industrial customer in massachusetts 
during the fourth quarter of  the company received final approval of a rate settlement that increased base distribution rates by about million on an annualized basis for its electric utility operations in new hampshire 
the company also recently received approval of a gas base rate settlement in massachusetts for its gas distribution operations  which will phase in rate increases of million as of february   and an additional million increase on november  together these rate settlements represent an increase of about on unitil s consolidated electric and gas distribution revenues

conservation load management conservation and load management expenses are expenses associated with the development  management  and delivery of the company s energy efficiency programs 
energy efficiency programs are designed  in conformity to state regulatory requirements  to help consumers use natural gas and electricity more efficiently and thereby decrease their energy costs 
programs are tailored to residential  small business and large business customer groups and provide educational materials  technical assistance  and rebates that contribute toward the cost of purchasing and installing approved measures 
approximately of these costs are related to electric operations and to gas operations 
total conservation load management expenses decreased slightly  by million  in compared to these costs are collected from customers on a fully reconciling basis and therefore  fluctuations in program costs do not affect earnings 
total conservation load management expenses increased million  in compared to depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  in compared to  reflecting lower amortization on regulatory assets  including seabrook station  million  and lower depreciation rates on utility plant resulting from the nhpuc s order in ues base rate case  million  partially offset by depreciation on utility plant additions  million

interest expense  net interest expense is presented in the financial statements net of interest income 
interest expense is mainly comprised of interest on long term debt and short term borrowings 
certain reconciling rate mechanisms used by the company s distribution operating utilities give rise to regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities on which interest is calculated 
the company operates a number of reconciling rate mechanisms to recover specifically identified costs on a pass through basis 
these reconciling rate mechanisms track costs and revenue on a monthly basis 
in any given month  this monthly tracking and reconciling process will produce either an under collected or an over collected balance of costs 
in accordance with the company s rate tariff  interest is accrued on these balances and will produce either interest income or interest expense 
interest income is recorded on an under collection of costs  which creates a regulatory asset to be recovered in future periods when rates are reset 
interest expense is recorded on an over collection of costs  which creates a regulatory liability to be refunded in future periods when rates are reset

a rise in bank borrowing rates and average daily bank borrowings during drove interest expense on short term debt 
liquidity  commitments and capital requirements sources of capital unitil requires capital to fund utility plant additions  working capital and other utility expenditures recovered in subsequent and future periods through regulated rates 
the capital necessary to meet these requirements is derived primarily from internally generated funds  which consist of cash flows from operating activities  excluding payment of dividends 
the company initially supplements internally generated funds through bank borrowings  as needed  under unsecured short term bank lines 
at december   unitil had an aggregate of million in unsecured revolving lines of credit with three banks 
on january   unitil s bank lines of credit increased to million with the same three banks 
the company anticipates that it will be able to secure renewal or replacement of some or all of its revolving lines of credit  in accordance with projected requirements 
the company had short term debt outstanding through bank borrowings of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
in addition  unitil had approximately million in cash at december  periodically  the company replaces portions of its short term debt with long term financings more closely matched to the long term nature of its utility assets 
the maximum amount of short term borrowings that may be incurred by unitil and its subsidiaries has been subject to periodic approval by the sec under the puhca and state regulators of the company s retail distribution utilities  ues and fg e 
however  in the puhca was repealed 
under the energy policy act of  many regulatory oversight responsibilities of the sec prior to the repeal of the puhca were transferred to the ferc 
the ferc s transition rule permits unitil and its subsidiaries to rely on outstanding sec orders issued under the puhca  including an order related to unitil s cash pooling and loan arrangement and certain maximum borrowing authorizations to be extended through december  at december   unitil had regulatory authorization to incur total short term bank borrowings up to a maximum of million  and ues and fg e had regulatory authorizations to borrow up to a maximum of million and million  respectively 
in  ues and fg e had average short term debt outstanding of million and million  respectively 
unitil and its subsidiaries are individually and collectively members of the unitil cash pool 
the cash pool is the financing vehicle for day to day cash borrowing and investing 
the cash pool agreement allows an efficient exchange of cash among unitil and its subsidiaries 
the interest rates charged to the subsidiaries for borrowing from the cash pool are based on unitil s actual interest costs from its banks under the revolving lines of credit 
at december   all unitil subsidiaries were in compliance with the regulatory requirements to participate in the cash pool 
on september   ues issued and sold million of series o first mortgage bonds  due september   to institutional investors in the form of a private placement see note 
the proceeds from this long term financing were used principally to permanently finance utility plant additions that had been previously financed on an interim basis with short term bank borrowings 
in december  fg e issued and sold million of unsecured long term notes under a debenture note structure 
table of contents see note 
the proceeds were utilized to repay outstanding short term indebtedness of fg e 
the company expects to continue to be able to satisfy its external financing needs by utilizing additional short term bank borrowings and to periodically replace short term debt with long term financings 
the continued availability of these methods of financing  as well as the company s choice of a specific form of security  will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to security market conditions  general economic climate  regulatory approvals  the ability to meet covenant issuance restrictions  if any  the level of the company s earnings  cash flows and financial position  and the competitive pricing offered by financing sources 
contractual obligations the table below lists the company s significant contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period significant contractual obligations s as of december  total beyond long term debt capital lease operating leases power supply contract obligations ma power supply contract obligations nh gas supply contracts total contractual cash obligations the company has material energy supply commitments that are discussed in note cash outlays for the purchase of electricity and natural gas to serve our customers are subject to full recovery through periodic changes in rates  with carrying charges on deferred balances 
from year to year  there are likely to be timing differences associated with the cash recovery of such costs  creating under or over recovery situations at any point in time 
rate recovery mechanisms are typically designed to collect the under recovered cash or refund the over collected cash over subsequent month periods 
the company also provides limited guarantees on certain electric supply contracts entered into by the retail distribution utilities 
the company s policy is to limit these guarantees to two years or less 
as of december  there are million of guarantees outstanding and these guarantees extend through october  benefit plan funding in the company and its subsidiaries made cash contributions to its pension plan in the amount of million 
in and  the company and its subsidiaries contributed approximately million and million  respectively to the voluntary employee benefit trusts vebt and expects to continue to make contributions to the vebt s in future years in amounts consistent with the amounts recovered in retail distribution utility rates for these other postretirement benefit costs 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not currently use  and is not dependent on the use of off balance sheet financing arrangements  such as securitization of receivables  or obtaining access to assets or cash through special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
the company does have an operating lease agreement with a major financial institution 
the operating lease is used to finance the company s utility vehicles

table of contents regulatory matters overview unitil s retail distribution utilities have the franchise to deliver electricity and or natural gas to all customers in our franchise areas  at rates established under traditional cost of service regulation 
under this regulatory structure  ues and fg e recover the cost of providing distribution service to their customers based on an historical test year  in addition to earning a return on their capital investment in utility assets 
as a result of a restructuring of the utility industry in massachusetts and new hampshire  all of unitil s customers have the opportunity to purchase their electric or natural gas supplies from third party suppliers 
most small and medium sized customers  however  continue to purchase such supplies through ues and fg e as the providers of last resort 
ues and fg e purchase electricity or natural gas from unaffiliated wholesale suppliers and recover the actual costs of these supplies  without profit or markup  through reconciling  pass through rate mechanisms that are periodically adjusted 
in connection with the implementation of retail choice  unitil power and fg e divested their long term power supply contracts through the sale of the entitlements to the electricity sold under those contracts 
ues and fg e recover in their rates all the costs associated with the divestiture of their power supply portfolios and have secured regulatory approval from the nhpuc and mdte  respectively  for the recovery of power supply related stranded costs and other restructuring related regulatory assets 
the remaining balance of these assets  to be recovered principally over the next four to six years  is million as of december  and is included in regulatory assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet see regulatory assets table in note unitil s retail distribution companies have a continuing obligation to submit filings in both states that demonstrate their compliance with regulatory mandates and provide for timely recovery of costs in accordance with their approved restructuring plans

its current retail electric distribution rates were approved by the mdte in fg e is required  as the provider of last resort  to purchase and provide power through default service for retail customers who chose not to buy  or were unable to purchase  energy from a competitive supplier 
prices for default service are set periodically based on market solicitations as approved by the mdte 
as of december   approximately percent of fg e s electric load was served by default service 
the remaining portion was served by competitive third party suppliers 
the vast majority of customers being served by competitive third party suppliers are large c i customers 
most residential and small commercial customers continue to purchase their electric supply through the retail distribution utilities 
the concentration of the competitive retail market on higher use customers has been a common experience throughout the new england electricity market 
as a result of the restructuring and the divestiture of fg e s owned generation assets and buyout of fg e s power supply obligations  regulatory assets on the company s balance sheets include the following three categories power supply buyout obligations associated with the divestiture of its long term purchase power obligations  recoverable deferred restructuring charges resulting from the restructuring legislation s seven year rate cap  and recoverable generation related assets associated with the divestiture of its owned generation plant 
fg e earns carrying charges on the majority of the unrecovered balances of the recoverable deferred restructuring charges 
the value of fg e s recoverable deferred restructuring charges and recoverable generation related assets was approximately million at december   and million at december   and is expected to be recovered in fg e s rates over the next four to six years 
in addition  as of december   fg e had recorded on its balance sheet million as power supply buyout obligations and corresponding regulatory assets associated with the divestiture of its long term purchase power contracts  which are included in unitil s consolidated financial statements  and on which carrying charges are not earned as the timing of cash disbursements and cash receipts associated with these long term obligations is matched through rates see note 
table of contents on march   the mdte approved fg e s and annual reconciliation of costs and revenues for transition  transmission  standard offer service  and default service filed under its restructuring plan 
fg e s and filings  which are subject to investigation  are pending 
the company expects that these filings will be approved without material changes or adjustments 
fg e gas division fg e provides natural gas delivery service to its customers on a firm or interruptible basis under unbundled distribution rates approved by the mdte 
its current retail distribution rates were approved by the mdte in fg e s customers may purchase gas supplies from third party vendors or purchase their gas from fg e as the provider of last resort 
fg e collects its gas supply costs through a seasonal reconciling cgac and recovers other related costs through a reconciling local distribution adjustment clause 
on january   the mdte approved a rate settlement agreement settlement which fg e and the attorney general of massachusetts had signed and filed with the mdte for fg e s gas division on november  under the settlement  fg e will phase in gas distribution rate changes with an initial rate increase of million as of february   and an additional million increase on november  the settlement also includes agreement on several other rate matters and service quality performance measures for the company s gas division in the areas of safety  customer service and satisfaction 
on september   the mdte issued an order allowing fg e to recover its actual gas and electric supply related bad debt effective december  prior to this final approval  fg e had recovered supply related bad debt based on a fixed rate formula that was resulting in a significant underrecovery of these costs 
on september   the attorney general filed a petition for appeal with the massachusetts supreme judicial court seeking to set aside the mdte s order of september  fg e intends to support the mdte s order but the company cannot predict the outcome of the attorney general s appeal at this time 
ues ues provides electric distribution service to its customers pursuant to rates approved by the nhpuc 
its current retail electric distribution rates were approved by the nhpuc in under the settlement agreement discussed below 
as the provider of last resort  ues also provides its customers with electric power through default service at rates which reflect ues costs for wholesale supply with no profit or markup 
ues procures default service power for its larger commercial and industrial customers on a quarterly basis  and for its smaller commercial and residential customers through a portfolio of longer term contracts on a semi annual basis 
ues recovers its costs for this service on a pass through basis through reconciling rate mechanisms 
as of december   approximately percent of ues electric load was served by default service 
the remaining portion was served by competitive third party suppliers 
the vast majority of customers being served by competitive third party suppliers are large c i customers 
most residential and small commercial customers continue to purchase their electric supply through the retail distribution utilities 
the concentration of the competitive retail market on higher use customers has been a common experience throughout the new england electricity market 
in the restructuring settlement  the nhpuc approved the divestiture of the long term power supply portfolio by unitil power and tariffs for ues for stranded cost recovery  including certain charges that are subject to annual or periodic reconciliation or future review 
as of december   ues had recorded on its balance sheets million as power supply contract obligations and corresponding regulatory assets associated with these long term purchase power stranded costs  which are included in unitil corporation s consolidated financial statements 
these power supply contract obligations are expected to be recovered principally over a period of approximately four years 
the company does not earn carrying charges on these regulatory assets as the timing of cash receipts and cash disbursements associated with these long term obligations is matched through rates 

table of contents on march   ues made its third annual reconciliation and rate filing with the nhpuc under its restructuring plan  effective may   including reconciliation of prior year costs and revenues  power supply and power supply related stranded costs 
the nhpuc approved the filing on april  on october   ues received approval from the nhpuc of a settlement agreement agreement resolving all issues in its electric distribution base rate case filed in november  the terms of the agreement provide for an increase in base distribution rates of million annually  effective as of january  additionally  the agreement authorizes two step increases in base distribution rates  related to utility plant additions in  of approximately million and million annually  effective as of november  and may   respectively 
also  the agreement provides for the recovery of approximately million annually of supply related operating and administrative costs through default energy service rates and a reduction of approximately million in annual depreciation expense  primarily reflecting an increase in utility plant and equipment average service lives 
the stipulated rate of return under the settlement is  including a return on equity of 
the agreement also authorizes a temporary rate surcharge for recovery of certain rate case expenses and recoupment of the authorized distribution rate increase from january through october ferc wholesale power markets fg e  ues and unitil power  as well as virtually all new england electric utilities  are participants in iso new england inc  the regional transmission organization rto in new england 
the regional bulk power system is operated by an independent corporate entity  iso ne 
the purpose of iso ne is to assure reliable operation of the bulk power system in the most economic manner for the region 
substantially all operation and dispatching of electric generation and bulk transmission capacity in new england are performed on a regional basis 
the tariff imposes generating capacity and reserve obligations  and provides for the use of major transmission facilities and support payments associated therewith 
the most notable benefits of the iso ne are coordinated power system operation in a reliable manner and a supportive business environment for the development of a competitive electric marketplace 
the formation of an rto and other wholesale market changes are not expected to have a material impact on unitil s operations because of the cost recovery mechanisms for wholesale energy and transmission costs approved by the mdte and nhpuc 
environmental matters the company s past and present operations include activities that are generally subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations 
the company believes it is in compliance with all applicable environmental and safety laws and regulations  and the company believes that as of december   there are no material losses reasonably possible in excess of recorded amounts 
however  there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future 
it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly stringent federal  state or local environmental laws and regulations could result in increased environmental compliance costs 
sawyer passway mgp site fg e continues to work with environmental regulatory agencies to identify and assess environmental issues at the former manufactured gas plant mgp site at sawyer passway  located in fitchburg  massachusetts 
fg e has proceeded with site remediation work as specified on the tier b permit issued by the massachusetts department of environmental protection dep  which allows fg e to work towards temporary closure of the site 
a status of temporary closure requires fg e to monitor the site until a feasible permanent remediation alternative can be developed and completed 
fg e has recovered the environmental response costs incurred at this former mgp site in gas rates pursuant to an mdte approved settlement agreement between the massachusetts attorney general and the natural gas utilities of the commonwealth of massachusetts agreement 
the agreement allows fg e to amortize and recover environmental response costs from gas customers over succeeding seven year periods  without carrying costs 
in addition fg e has filed suit against several of its former insurance carriers 
table of contents seeking coverage for past and future environmental response costs at the site 
any recovery that fg e receives from insurance or third parties with respect to environmental response costs  net of the unrecovered costs associated therewith  are split equally between fg e and its gas customers 
fg e is in the process of developing long range plans for a feasible permanent remediation solution for the sawyer passway site  including alternatives for re use of the site 
included on the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  in environmental obligations is million related to estimated future clean up costs for permanent remediation of the site 
a corresponding regulatory asset was recorded to reflect the future rate recovery for these costs 
the amounts recorded do not assume any amounts are recoverable from insurance companies or other third parties 
the company s ultimate liability for future environmental remediation costs may vary from estimates  which may be adjusted as new information or future developments become available 
based on the company s current assessment of its environmental responsibilities  existing legal requirements and regulatory policies  the company does not believe that these environmental costs will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
employees and employee relations as of december   the company and its subsidiaries had employees 
the company considers it relationships with employees to be good and has not experienced any major labor disruptions 
there are approximately employees represented by labor unions 
these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  which expire may  the agreements provide discreet salary adjustments  established work practices and uniform benefit packages 
the company expects to successfully negotiate new agreements prior to their expiration dates 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in making those estimates and assumptions  the company is sometimes required to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about the impact of matters that are inherently uncertain and for which different estimates that could reasonably have been used could have resulted in material differences in its financial statements 
if actual results were to differ significantly from those estimates  assumptions and judgment  the financial position of the company could be materially affected and the results of operations of the company could be materially different than reported 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting policies  which are defined as those policies where judgments or uncertainties could materially affect the application of those policies 
for a complete discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to the financial statements and note summary of significant accounting policies 
regulatory accounting the company s principal business is the distribution of electricity and natural gas by the retail distribution companies ues and fg e 
both ues and fg e are subject to regulation by the ferc and fg e is regulated by the mdte and ues is regulated by the nhpuc 
accordingly  the company uses the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
sfas no 

in accordance with sfas no 
 the company has recorded regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities which will be recovered or refunded in future electric and gas retail rates 

table of contents sfas no 
specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise 
revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred 
if regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future  these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under sfas no 
if revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future  these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under sfas no 
the company s principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
generally  the company is currently receiving or being credited with a return on all of its regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made 
generally  the company is currently paying or being charged with a return on all of its regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received 
the company s regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers  or applied for customer benefit  in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission 
the application of sfas no 
results in the deferral of costs as regulatory assets that  in some cases  have not yet been approved for recovery by the applicable regulatory commission 
the company must conclude that any costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery in rates 
however  regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs  which can have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company believes it is probable that its regulated utility companies will recover their investments in long lived assets  including regulatory assets 
the company also has commitments under long term contracts for the purchase of electricity and natural gas from various suppliers 
the annual costs under these contracts are included in purchased electricity and purchased gas in the consolidated statements of earnings and these costs are recoverable in current and future rates under various orders issued by the ferc  mdte and nhpuc 
if the company  or a portion of its assets or operations  were to cease meeting the criteria for application of these accounting rules  accounting standards for businesses in general would become applicable and immediate recognition of any previously deferred costs  or a portion of deferred costs  would be required in the year in which the criteria are no longer met  if such deferred costs were not recoverable in the portion of the business that continues to meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
if unable to continue to apply the provisions of sfas no 
 the company would be required to apply the provisions of fasb statement no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of financial accounting standards board statement no 
in the company s opinion  the its regulated operations will be subject to sfas no 
for the foreseeable future 
utility revenue recognition regulated utility revenues are based on rates and charges approved by federal and state regulatory commissions 
revenues related to the sale of electric and gas service are recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers 
the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each calendar month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated 
this unbilled revenue is estimated each month based on estimated customer usage by class and applicable customer rates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company recognizes a provision for doubtful accounts each month 
the amount of the monthly provision is based upon the company s experience in collecting electric and gas utility service accounts receivable in prior years 
account write offs  net of recoveries  are processed monthly 
at the end of each month  an analysis of the delinquent receivables is performed and the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed 
the analysis takes into account an assumption about the cash recovery of delinquent receivables and also uses calculations related to customers who have chosen payment plans to resolve their arrears 
the analysis also calculates the amount of written off receivables that 
table of contents are recoverable through regulatory rate reconciling mechanisms 
the company is authorized by regulators to recover the supply related portion of its written off accounts from customers through periodically reconciling rate mechanisms 
evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires judgment about the assumptions used in the analysis 
also  the company has experienced periods when state regulators have extended the periods during which certain standard credit and collection activities of utility companies are suspended 
in periods when account write offs exceed estimated levels  the company adjusts the provision for doubtful accounts to maintain an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts balance 
retirement benefit obligations the company has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all its employees and also provides certain other post retirement benefits pbop  primarily medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees 
the company also has a supplemental executive retirement plan serp covering certain executives of the company 
in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  sfas no 
 an amendment of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and sfas no 
r  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
sfas no 
requires companies to record on their balance sheets the overfunded or underfunded status of their retirement benefit obligations rbo based on the projected benefit obligation 
the company has recognized a corresponding regulatory asset  to recognize the future collection of these obligations in electric and gas retail rates 
see note for a table showing the incremental effect of applying sfas no 
on individual line items of the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  the company accounts for its pension and postretirement benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 sfas no 
and sfas no 
in applying these accounting policies  the company has made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions  including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets  future compensation  health care cost trends  and appropriate discount rates 
for each of these plans  the development of the benefit obligation  fair value of plan assets  funded status and net periodic benefit cost is based on these significant assumptions 
the company s reported costs of providing retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
the company s health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
rbo are affected by actual employee demographics  the level of contributions made to the plans  earnings on plan assets  and health care cost trends 
changes made to the provisions of these plans may also affect current and future costs 
rbo may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including  anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the rbo 
if these assumptions were changed  the resultant change in benefit obligations  fair values of plan assets  funded status and net periodic benefit costs could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
see note pension income is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of  and for  and  respectively 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumption  the company evaluated input from actuaries and investment managers 
the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on target asset allocation assumptions of in common stock equities and in fixed income securities 
the combination of these target allocations and expected returns resulted in the overall assumed long term rate of return of for the company will continue to evaluate the actuarial assumptions  including the expected rate of return  at least annually  and will adjust the appropriate assumptions as necessary 

table of contents the company bases the actuarial determination of pension expense on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a three year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a three year period  the future value of the market related assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized 
the company s pension expense for the years  and was   and  respectively 
had the company used the fair value of assets instead of the market related value  pension expense for the years  and would have been   and  respectively 
the discount rate that is utilized in determining future pension obligations is based on a market average of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the discount rate used for was 
for the period january  through may   the discount rate used was 
in may  the company reached agreements with its union labor bargaining units for new five year contracts  effective june   which resulted in amendments to the defined benefit pension plan 
effective for the period of june  through december   the company lowered the assumed discount rate to 
the discount rate used for the fiscal year was 
for  a change in the discount rate of would have resulted in an increase or decrease of approximately  in the net periodic pension cost 
similarly  for and  a change in the discount rate of would have resulted in an increase or decrease of approximately  the compensation cost increase assumption used for  and was  based on the expected long term increase in compensation costs for personnel covered by the plan 
income taxes income tax expense is calculated in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates for each period for which a statement of income is presented 
this process involves estimating the company s actual current tax liabilities as well as assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as timing of the deduction of expenses for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company accounts for income tax assets  liabilities and expenses in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
which is the authoritative pronouncement on accounting for and reporting income taxes 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of fas fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in enterprise s financial statements 
fin prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold for the recognition and measurement of the benefits of a tax position taken or expected to be taken 
fin applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to fas this includes tax positions considered to be routine as well as those with a high degree of uncertainty such as tax advantaged transactions 
fin effectively amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 
 such that all references to income taxes in sfas no 
have been deleted and fin is now the primary guidance in accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
under fin  tax positions accounted for under fas will be evaluated for recognition  derecognition  and classification and the cumulative affect of adopting fin may be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings 
fin requires disclosures of items and amounts that would affect the company s effective tax rate in its statement of earnings 
fin also provides guidance on disclosures for interim reporting periods for accounting for income taxes  interest and penalties 
the company will adopt fin as of january   as required 
the company does not expect that the adoption of fin will have a significant impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 

table of contents depreciation depreciation expense is calculated based on the useful lives of assets and judgment is involved when estimating the useful lives of certain assets 
the company conducts independent depreciation studies on a periodic basis as part of the regulatory ratemaking process and considers the results presented in these studies in determining the useful lives of the company s fixed assets 
a change in the estimated useful lives of these assets could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contingencies the company s accounting policy is to record and or disclose commitments and contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
applies to an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
as of december   the company is not aware of any material commitments or contingencies other than those disclosed in the significant contractual obligations table in the contractual obligations section above and the commitments and contingencies footnote to the company s consolidated financial statements below 
refer to recently issued accounting pronouncements in note of the notes of consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards 
for further information regarding these types of activities  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  note  income taxes  note  energy supply  note  benefit plans  and note  commitment and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk please also refer to item a 
risk factors 
interest rate risk as discussed above  unitil meets its external financing needs by issuing short term and long term debt 
the majority of debt outstanding represents long term notes bearing fixed rates of interest 
changes in market interest rates do not affect interest expense resulting from these outstanding long term debt securities 
however  the company periodically repays its short term debt borrowings through the issuance of new long term debt securities 
changes in market interest rates may affect the interest rate and corresponding interest expense on any new issuances of long term debt securities 
in addition  short term debt borrowings bear a variable rate of interest 
as a result  changes in short term interest rates will increase or decrease interest expense in future periods 
for example  if the average amount of short term debt outstanding of million for the period of one year  a change in interest rates of would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately  the average interest rate on short term borrowings was  and during  and  respectively 
market risk although unitil s utility operating companies are subject to commodity price risk as part of their traditional operations  the current regulatory framework within which these companies operate allows for full collection of electric power and natural gas supply costs in rates on a pass through basis 
consequently  there is limited commodity price risk after consideration of the related rate making 
additionally  as discussed above and below in regulatory matters  the company has divested its commodity related contracts and therefore  further reduced its exposure to commodity risk
