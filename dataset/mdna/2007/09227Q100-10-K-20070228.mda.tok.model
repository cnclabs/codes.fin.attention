item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements reflect our current view with respect to future events and financial performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties  including those set forth under item a  risk factors  and elsewhere in this report  that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results 
overview we are the leading global provider of software and related services designed specifically for nonprofit organizations 
our products and services enable nonprofit organizations to increase donations  reduce fundraising costs  improve communications with constituents  manage their finances and optimize internal operations 
we have focused solely on the nonprofit market since our incorporation in and have developed our suite of products and services based upon our extensive knowledge of the operating challenges facing nonprofit organizations 
at the end of  we had over  customers  of which or almost  pay annual maintenance and support fees 
our customers operate in multiple verticals within the nonprofit market including religion  education  foundations  health and human services  arts and cultural  public and societal benefits  environment and animal welfare  and international and foreign affairs 
we derive revenue from licensing software products and providing a broad offering of services  including consulting  training  installation  implementation  and donor prospect research and modeling services  as well as ongoing customer support and maintenance 
consulting  training and implementation are generally not essential to the functionality of our software products and are sold separately 
accordingly  we recognize revenue from these services separately from license fees 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to our revenue recognition  allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  impairment of long 
table of contents lived and intangible assets  stock based compensation and provision for income taxes and realization of deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
on an ongoing basis  we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we are not aware of any circumstances in the past  which have caused these estimates and assumptions to be materially wrong 
furthermore  we are not currently aware of any material changes in our business that might cause these assumptions or estimates to differ significantly 
in our discussion below of deferred taxes  the most significant asset subject to such assumptions and estimates  we have described the sensitivity of these assumptions or estimates to potential deviations in actual results 
actual results could differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the critical accounting policies listed below affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sops and  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants  and in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
as we develop new products  we may experience difficulty in determining vsoe regarding the fair value of those new products 
this would result in the deferral of revenue on those transactions until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered or until vsoe is established 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
delivery occurs when the product is delivered 
our typical license agreement does not include customer acceptance provisions  if acceptance provisions are provided  delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable with our standard payment terms 
we consider payment terms greater than days to be beyond our customary payment terms 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we postpone recognition of the revenue until cash collection 
we sell software licenses with maintenance and  frequently  professional services 
we allocate revenue to delivered components  normally the license component of the arrangement  using the residual value method based on objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to our company 
fair value for the maintenance services associated with our software licenses is based upon renewal rates stated in our agreements  which vary according to the level of the maintenance program 
fair value of professional services and other products and services  which is evaluated at least annually  is based on sales of these products and services to other customers when sold on a stand alone basis 
we recognize revenue from maintenance services ratably over the contract term  which is usually one year 
maintenance revenue also includes the right to unspecified product upgrades on an if and when available basis 
subscription revenue includes fees for hosted solutions  data enrichment services and hosted online training programs 
subscription based revenue and any related set up fees are recognized ratably over the twelve month service period of the contracts 
hosting revenues are recognized ratably over the thirty six month period of the hosting contracts 

table of contents our services  which include consulting  installation and implementation services  are generally billed based on hourly rates plus reimbursable travel related expenses 
for small service engagements  less than approximately  we frequently contract for and bill based on a fixed fee plus reimbursable travel related expenses 
we recognize this revenue upon completion of the work performed 
when our services include software customization  these services are provided to support customer requests for assistance in creating special reports and other minor enhancements that will assist with efforts to improve operational efficiency and or to support business process improvements 
these services are not essential to the functionality of our software and rarely exceed three months in duration 
we recognize revenue as these services are performed 
when we sell hosting separately from consulting  installation and implementation services  we recognize that revenue ratably over the service period 
we sell training at a fixed rate for each specific class  at a per attendee price  or at a packaged price for several attendees  and revenue is recognized only upon the customer attending and completing training 
during the second quarter of  we introduced the blackbaud training pass  which permits customers to attend unlimited training over a specified contract period  typically one year  subject to certain restrictions 
this revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period that is typically one year 
we recognize revenue from donor prospect research and data modeling service engagements upon delivery 
to the extent that our customers are billed and or pay for the above described services in advance of delivery  the amounts are recorded in deferred revenue 
sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts we provide customers a day right of return and maintain a reserve for returns 
we estimate the amount of this reserve based on historical experience and existing economic conditions 
provisions for sales returns are charged against the related revenue items 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from extending credit to our customers 
in judging the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors including historical bad debt experience  the general economic environment  the need for specific customer reserves and the aging of our receivables 
any necessary provision is reflected in general and administrative expense 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors and if any receivables were to deteriorate  an additional provision for doubtful accounts could be required 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we review identifiable intangible and other long lived assets for impairment when events change or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or significant adverse change in the business climate 
if such events or changes in circumstances are present  the undiscounted cash flow method is used to determine whether the asset is impaired 
cash flows would include the estimated terminal value of the asset and exclude any interest charges 
to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining life of the asset  the impairment is measured using discounted cash flows 
the discount rate utilized would be based on our best estimate of the related risks and return at the time the impairment assessment is made 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  impairment is indicated 
all of the goodwill is assigned to the various reporting units 

table of contents stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board s fasb sfas statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective application method 
sfas no 
r replaced sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
under the modified prospective application method  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
the provisions of sfas no 
r apply to grants made after the adoption date and existing grants which were partially unvested at that date 
compensation expense for grants outstanding on the date of adoption is being recognized over the remaining service period using the grant date fair values and amortization methods determined previously for the sfas no 
pro forma disclosures 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation under apb no 
 which provided that no compensation expense should be recorded for stock options or other stock based awards to employees that are granted with an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the estimated fair value per share of our common stock on the grant date of the award 
certain of our option grants were accounted for as variable awards under the provisions of apb no 
 which required us to record deferred compensation  and recognize compensation expense over the requisite vesting period  for the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the stock at each reporting date 
the adoption of sfas no 
r resulted in the reclassification of approximately million of unamortized deferred compensation to additional paid in capital that had previously been subject to variable accounting under apb no 
 and a nominal cumulative effect adjustment to apply an assumed forfeiture rate to expense previously taken on options unvested as of the date of adoption  which was recorded in general and administrative expense 
the adoption of sfas r did not cause us to modify any existing awards  change any terms of existing awards  or otherwise modify our share based compensation plans 
the adoption of sfas no 
r had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our stock based compensation assumptions and expenses  including pro forma disclosures for prior periods under the provisions of sfas no 
no new stock options were issued in the year ended december  the fair value of options issued in prior periods was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of our restricted stock awards was determined by using the closing price of the company s shares  as traded on the nasdaq global select market on the date of the grant 
the fair value of our stock appreciation rights sars  which were granted for the first time in  was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding sars 
we have separately disclosed stock based compensation throughout this discussion and in our consolidated financial statements because  in managing our operations  we believe such costs significantly affect our ability to better understand and manage other operating expenses and cash needs 
provision for income tax and valuation of deferred tax assets we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach as prescribed by sfas statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this approach requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or income tax returns 
using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences 
table of contents between the financial reporting and the tax basis of an asset or liability 
we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in a net deferred tax asset  which is included on our consolidated balance sheets 
the final tax outcome of these matters might be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions  benefits and accruals 
any difference could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 
prior to october   we were organized as an s corporation under the internal revenue code and  therefore  were not subject to federal income taxes 
in addition  we were not subject to income tax in many of the states in which we operated as a result of our s corporation status 
we historically made distributions to our stockholders to cover the stockholders anticipated tax liability 
in connection with a recapitalization agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements  we converted our us taxable status from an s corporation to a c corporation 
accordingly  since october   we have been subject to federal and state income taxes 
upon the conversion and in connection with the recapitalization  we recorded a one time benefit of million to establish a deferred tax asset as a result of the recapitalization agreement 
we must assess the likelihood that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
except with respect to certain state income tax credits as discussed in note of these consolidated financial statements  we have not recorded a valuation allowance as of december  and  because we expect to be able to utilize our entire net deferred tax asset 
the ability to utilize our net deferred tax asset is solely dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 
based on current estimates of revenue and expenses  we expect future taxable income will be more than sufficient to recover the annual amount of additional tax deductions permitted 
even if actual results are significantly below our current estimates  the recovery still remains likely and no valuation allowance would be necessary 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes 
to the extent that the final results differ from these estimated amounts that were initially recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and could have an impact on the deferred tax asset 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded at an amount based upon a blended us federal income tax rate of 
this us federal income tax rate is based on our expectation that our deductible and taxable temporary differences will reverse over a period of years during which  except for due to stock option exercises and other reductions to income  we will have annual taxable income exceeding million per year 
if our results of operations fall below that threshold in the future  we will adjust our deferred tax assets and liabilities to an amount reflecting a reduced expected us federal income tax rate  consistent with the corresponding expectation of lower taxable income 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies in the normal course of business 
we accrue for loss contingencies when a loss is estimable and probable

prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for options under apb no 
because of certain provisions in certain of the option agreements  we were required to account for these options under variable accounting 
variable accounting requires marking these options to the market price on the reporting date and recognizing a corresponding expense or benefit in the financial statements  which can cause significant fluctuations in compensation expense and resulted in a significant decrease in stock based compensation in compared to

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this approach requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or income tax returns 
using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of an asset or liability 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
if a change in the effective tax rate to be applied to the timing differences or a change in a valuation reserve is determined to be appropriate  it will affect the provision for income taxes during the period that the determination is made 
in  we increased our deferred tax asset valuation allowance by million for state credits that are expected to expire unused 
in  we recognized an income tax benefit of million related to changes in state income tax credits 
our deferred tax asset at december  included state income tax credits  net of federal taxes at  of approximately million that expire between and we established a full valuation allowance against these credits when the asset was recorded because  based on information available at that time  it was not deemed probable that these credits would be realized 
during  as a result of profitable results in and  expectations of future profitability and utilization of all related state net operating losses  we released million of the valuation allowance related to these state income tax credits which resulted in a credit to income tax expense for additionally  certain other state tax credits whose use was previously restricted to reducing state franchise taxes became available to offset state income tax as a result of a clarification in enacted tax law during accordingly  a deferred tax asset was established during in the amount of million  net of federal taxes at  related to the associated future reduction of state income taxes which resulted in an additional credit to income tax expense for a valuation allowance was established for million of the million representing 
table of contents the portion of the credits not deemed more likely than not to be utilized which resulted in a debit to income tax expense for the net effect of these items related to state income tax credits was a decrease in our income tax expense of million 
we continue to evaluate the realizability of the remaining state tax credits and any further adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made in the period we determine it is more likely than not any of the remaining credits will be utilized 
liquidity and capital resources at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  compared to million at december  the million increase in cash and cash equivalents during is the result of million of cash generated from operations  million from proceeds of stock option exercises and a million tax benefit on the exercise of stock options offset by million in dividend payments to our stockholders  million of purchases of our common stock  million for acquisitions of companies and million of purchases of property and equipment 
on september   we entered into a million revolving credit facility  which replaced our prior million revolving credit facility that was terminated in july amounts borrowed under the credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes 
no amounts were drawn under the credit facility at closing and there was no outstanding balance as of december  amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a variable rate based on the prime rate  federal funds rate or libor plus a margin of between and based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility are guaranteed by our operating subsidiaries and it is subject to restrictions on certain types of transactions and certain covenants including a maximum leverage ratio  minimum interest coverage ratio and minimum net worth 
additionally  the credit facility restricts our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase our common stock
