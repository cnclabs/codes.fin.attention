item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction for a description of the company s business  refer to item of part i of this annual report on form k 
as indicated in item  the company is primarily engaged in three business segments the real estate business operated by amrep southwest and the fulfillment services and newsstand distribution services businesses operated by kable 
data concerning industry segments is set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s foreign sales and activities are not significant 
the following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
all references in this item to  and mean the fiscal years ended april   and critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company discloses its significant accounting policies in the notes to its audited consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of those financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas that require significant judgments and estimates to be made include i the determination of revenue recognition for the newsstand distribution services business  which is based on estimates of allowances for magazine returns to the company from wholesalers and the offsetting return of magazines by the company to publishers for credit  ii allowances for doubtful accounts  iii real estate cost of sales calculations  which are based on land development budgets and estimates of costs to complete  iv the determination of revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method for certain development contracts  which is determined based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the project  v cash flow and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long lived assets  goodwill impairment and assets held for sale  vi actuarially determined benefit obligations for pension plan accounting  and vii legal contingencies 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
there are numerous critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas 
management bases its critical assumptions on historical experience  third party data and various other estimates that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
certain of the most critical assumptions made in arriving at these accounting estimates include the following i newsstand distribution services revenues represent commissions earned from the distribution of publications for client publishers that are recorded by the company at the time the publications go on sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
the publications generally are sold on a fully returnable basis  which is in accordance with prevailing trade practice 
accordingly  the company provides for estimated returns by charges to income that are determined on an issue by issue basis utilizing historical experience and current sales information 
the financial impact to the company of a change in the sales estimate for magazine returns to it from its wholesalers is substantially offset by the simultaneous change in the company s estimate of its cost of purchases since it passes on the returns to publishers for credit 
as a result  the effect of a difference between the actual and estimated return rates on the company s commission revenues is the amount of the commission attributable to the difference 
the effect of an increase or decrease in the company s estimated rate of returns of during any period would be dependent upon the mix of magazines involved and the related selling prices and commission rates  but would generally result in a change in that period s net commission revenues of approximately  ii management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by attempting to identify troubled accounts by analyzing the credit risk of specific customers and by using historical experience applied to the aging of accounts and  where appropriate within the real estate business  by reviewing any collateral which may secure a receivable  iii real estate development costs are incurred throughout the life of a project  and the costs of initial sales from a project frequently must include a portion of costs that have been budgeted based on engineering estimates or other studies  but not yet incurred  iv percentage of completion revenue recognition for certain development contracts is based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
total estimated costs  and thus contract income  are impacted by several factors including  but not limited to  changes in the costs of subcontractors  materials and equipment  productivity and scheduling  v asset impairment determinations including that of goodwill  which is based on the fair value of reporting units are based upon the intended use of assets and expected future cash flows  vi benefit obligations and other pension plan accounting and disclosure is based upon numerous assumptions and estimates  including the expected rate of investment return on retirement plan assets  the interest rate used to determine the present value of liabilities the discount rate  and certain employee related factors such as turnover  retirement age and mortality 
the effect of every change in the investment rate of return on retirement plan assets would increase or decrease the pension expense by approximately  per year  an increase in the discount rate of at a fiscal year end would result in a decrease in the subsequent year s pension cost of approximately  and a decrease in the discount rate of at a fiscal year end would increase the subsequent year s pension cost by approximately  and vii the company is currently involved in one significant legal proceeding which is described in item of this annual report on form k  and various more routine matters 
if the summary judgment in favor of the defendants  including the company  were reversed upon appeal in the significant proceeding and if the plaintiffs were then to prevail in the case  the result could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
also  it is possible that the consolidated financial position or results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an outcome of other litigation that is significantly different from the company s assumptions 
year ended april  compared to year ended april  results of operations net income in was  or per share  compared to net income of  or per share 
results for consisted of net income from continuing operations of  or per share  and a net loss from discontinued operations of  or per share  compared to the results which consisted of net income from continuing operations of  or per share  and net income from discontinued operations of  or per share 
consolidated revenues were  an increase of  over consolidated revenues of  the increase in consolidated revenues was attributable to continued revenue growth achieved by the company s real estate operations  and  to a lesser extent  the acquisition of palm coast by the company s kable media services  inc subsidiary 
the increase in net income from continuing operations was attributable to higher gross profits associated with the increased real estate land sales 
net income from discontinued operations in reflected the gain from the disposition of the primary assets of the company s el dorado  new mexico water utility subsidiary  which were taken through condemnation proceedings during in june  the company settled all existing litigation involving this former subsidiary 
the total amount of the settlements  including legal fees  was  net of tax  and has been accounted for as a loss from discontinued operations in revenues from real estate land sales at amrep southwest increased  from  for to  in this substantial revenue increase was due to higher average selling prices and increased sales of both developed and undeveloped lots as well as commercial and industrial properties in the company s principal market of rio rancho  new mexico 
an increase in revenues from additional sales in all categories of residential and commercial lots in compared to resulted from the strength of the rio rancho market  particularly in the first six months of the year 
revenues from sales of developed lots to homebuilders increased from  in to  in revenues from sales of undeveloped builder lots increased from  in to  principally due to higher prices for scattered builder lots  and revenues from sales of commercial and industrial properties increased in to  from  in as a result of an increased number of and size of transactions 
the average gross profit percentage on land sales increased from in to for  reflecting higher average selling prices in and the mix of developed and undeveloped residential lots sold in each of the periods 
in recent years the average selling price of land sold by the company in rio rancho has increased significantly  from  per acre in to  per acre in and  per acre in this increase has been due to a number of factors  including differences in the mix of the types of properties sold in each period and the effects of a strong regional market which resulted in three consecutive years of a record number of single family residential housing starts in rio rancho  reaching a total in excess of  starts during the twelve months ending april  the real estate market in rio rancho has softened in recent months  however  and there was a decline in the number of housing starts in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  in may rio rancho s largest employer  intel corporation  announced a workforce reduction starting in august of at least  jobs in rio rancho  which could reduce the demand for the company s land inventory 
as a result of these and other factors  including the nature and timing of specific transactions  revenues and related gross profits from real estate land sales can vary significantly from period to period and prior results are not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods 
revenues from kable s fulfillment services and newsstand distribution services businesses collectively  media services increased  from  in to  in this increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the january  acquisition of palm coast 
newsstand distribution services revenues increased by  from  in to  in  principally due to a increase in commission revenues from new business 
fulfillment services revenues increased by  from  in to  in due to the contribution from palm coast 
the increase in revenues from the palm coast acquisition was partially offset by decreases in core and ancillary services of customer telephone  lettershop and list services of other parts of kable s fulfillment services business 
the revenue decreases in core and ancillary services resulted from continued competitive market pressures and customer losses 
pricing pressure from customers due to the competitive environment for fulfillment services business also had a negative effect on fulfillment services revenues and profitability in the fourth quarter of  which is expected to continue into fiscal media services operating expenses increased by  in compared to  primarily attributable to i the addition of operating expenses of palm coast and ii an increase in newsstand distribution services operating expenses  principally payroll  associated with the revenue growth of that business  offset in part by decreased payroll and benefit expenses in other parts of kable s fulfillment services businesses 
media services general and administrative expenses increased  in compared to as the addition of palm coast was only partially offset by lower costs in other fulfillment services businesses 
although there are multiple revenue streams in the fulfillment services business  including revenues from the maintenance of customer computer files and the performance of other fulfillment related activities  including telephone call center support and graphic arts and lettershop services  a customer generally contracts for and utilizes all available services as a total package  and the company would not provide its ancillary services to a customer unless it was also providing the core service of maintaining a data base of subscriber names 
thus  variations in fulfillment revenues are the result of fluctuations in the number and sizes of customers rather than in the demand for a particular service 
this is also true in the newsstand distribution services business where there is only one primary service provided which results in one revenue source  the commissions earned on the distribution of magazines 
the company competes with other companies  including three much larger companies in the newsstand distribution services business and one much larger company in the fulfillment services business  and the competition for new customers is intense in both segments  which results in a price sensitive industry that may restrict the company s ability to increase its prices 
during fiscal  kable acquired the colorado based fulfillment services business of electronic data systems corporation eds 
since that time kable has outsourced to eds a substantial portion of the data processing required to service that business but has intended to move that activity in house when it had a suitable internal data processing system 
kable has been developing an expanded internal data processing platform kable system to service the eds business along with its existing fulfillment business 
palm coast  which the company acquired in january  also maintains an internal data processing system 
the company is in the process of migrating its colorado fulfillment services customers away from the eds system to the company s internal systems 
the migration process is technically complex and the company is encountering unanticipated problems that have delayed its full implementation 
should the company continue to encounter such problems and delays  it may continue to be burdened with its outsourcing and additional development costs  and it may result in a devaluation of its investment in the expanded data processing platform 
kable management is presently evaluating its future operational course of action to determine the next steps relative to the migration of the former eds customers to the new kable system and additionally considering the possibility of maintaining the palm coast and other customers on the palm coast system 
should kable be unable  in an economically practical manner  to resolve the unanticipated problems that have arisen within the eds migration process  it will continue to be burdened with additional development and outsourcing costs which may negatively impact the value of its investment in the kable system and offset the benefits being contributed by the palm coast acquisition 
real estate commissions and selling expenses remained generally unchanged in compared to despite the increase in land sales  primarily due to decreases in variable commissions and selling expenses 
such costs generally vary depending upon the terms of specific land sale transactions 
real estate and corporate general and administrative expenses increased by  in compared to the prior year due to increased legal  real estate consulting and other consulting fees associated with sarbanes oxley act requirements 
interest and other revenues increased by  in compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of increased interest income on invested cash balances as well as from the first quarter sale of certain real estate investment assets  including the company s office building in rio rancho  new mexico  which in the aggregate contributed a pre tax gain of  the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations was in compared to in the decrease from the statutory rate in both years was primarily due to tax benefits associated with charitable contributions of land

consolidated revenues increased  to  in from  in as a result of the increased real estate revenues  partially offset by decreased revenues from the company s media services operations 
net income from discontinued operations in reflected the gain from the disposition of the primary assets of the company s el dorado  new mexico water utility subsidiary  which were taken through condemnation proceedings 
the company began accounting for this subsidiary as a discontinued operation in the quarter ended january  accordingly  financial information for prior periods was reclassified to conform to this presentation 
revenues from land sales at the company s amrep southwest subsidiary increased approximately  from  in to  in  resulting in significantly higher gross profits in compared to the prior year 
this substantial revenue increase was due to increased sales of both developed and undeveloped lots in the company s principal market of rio rancho  new mexico 
an increase in revenues from the sale of developed lots to homebuilders from  in to  in demonstrated the continuing strength of the rio rancho market  while revenues from the sale of undeveloped builder lots increased from  in to  in  principally due to one large transaction that was part of a redevelopment project being undertaken by another company 
revenues from sales of commercial and industrial properties decreased slightly in  from  in to  in  as the prior year included one large sale that represented a major component of the revenues whereas activity consisted of numerous smaller transactions 
the average gross profit percentage on land sales decreased to in from in  reflecting the relative mix of lots sold in each year 
revenues and related gross profits from land sales can vary significantly from period to period as a result of many factors  including the nature and timing of specific transactions  and prior results are not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods 
revenues from media services operations decreased from  in to  in or a decrease of 
this revenue decline was due to a decrease in fulfillment services revenues of  offset in part by a  increase in newsstand distribution services revenues 
the revenue decline in fulfillment services in was principally caused by customer losses that occurred in earlier periods at kable s colorado fulfillment services business that was acquired from eds in fiscal  while revenues of newsstand distribution services increased primarily because decreases in gross billings to existing customers were offset by additional revenues generated by new business 
total operating expenses of the media services operation decreased by  in compared to  with the operating expenses of fulfillment services decreasing  compared to the prior year principally due to decreases in payroll and other variable expenses resulting from the fulfillment services revenue decrease as well as the non recurrence of certain consulting expenses incurred in the prior year

such costs generally vary depending upon the terms of specific sale transactions 
real estate and corporate general and administrative expenses increased by  in as a result of an increase in the company s stock price which was used to value the portion of director compensation that was paid in stock  the addition of a corporate general counsel and the presence in the prior year of a sublease on certain corporate office space which offset a portion of the company s rental expense 
general and administrative costs of media services operations decreased by approximately  from to  and remained at approximately of kable s total revenues in both years 
interest and other revenues increased from  in to  in as a result of higher average balances of invested cash and cash equivalents during other expenses primarily consisted of expenses associated with rental operations and real estate taxes on land parcels not under development  and these expenses decreased from approximately  in to  in  principally due to costs incurred in to settle certain warranty claims related to the company s previously discontinued homebuilding operations

fin also provides accounting guidance for related income tax effects of tax positions that do not meet the recognition threshold specified in this interpretation 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently in the process of assessing the impact of fin based on the company s preliminary analysis  it anticipates that the adoption of fin on may  will not have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows

segment information information by industry segment is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this information has been prepared in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related disclosures  which requires that industry segment information be prepared in a manner consistent with the manner in which financial information is prepared and evaluated by management for making operating decisions 
a number of assumptions and estimations are required to be made in the determination of segment data  including the need to make certain allocations of common costs and expenses among segments 
on an annual basis  management has evaluated the basis upon which costs are allocated  and has periodically made revisions to these methods of allocation 
accordingly  the determination of income from continuing operations before income taxes of each segment as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements is presented for informational purposes  and is not necessarily the amount that would be reported if the segment were an independent company 
impact of inflation operations of the company can be impacted by inflation 
within the industries in which the company operates  inflation can cause increases in the cost of materials  services  interest and labor 
unless such increased costs are recovered through increased sales prices or improved operating efficiencies  operating margins will decrease 
within the land development industry  the company encounters particular risks 
a large part of the company s real estate sales are to homebuilders who face their own inflationary concerns that rising housing costs  including interest costs  may substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers and make it difficult for them to finance the purchase of a new home or sell their existing home 
if this situation were to exist  the demand for the company s land by these homebuilder customers could decrease 
in general  in recent years interest rates have been at historically low levels and other price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in the company s markets  and as a result the company has not found the inflation risk to be a significant problem in its real estate or media services operations businesses
