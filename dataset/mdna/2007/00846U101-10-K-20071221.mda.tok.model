overview and executive summary agilent technologies  inc we  agilent or the company is the world s premier measurement company  providing core bio analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications  electronics  life sciences and chemical analysis industries 
agilent has two primary businesses focused on the electronic measurement market and the bio analytical measurement market 
our fiscal year end is october unless otherwise stated  all years and dates refer to our fiscal year 
in december  we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business 
in  we completed the initial public offering of our semiconductor test solutions business  verigy ltd 
verigy 
the results of our semiconductor products business and our semiconductor test solutions business are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this annual report on form k 
agilent s net revenue from continuing operations in was  million  an increase of percent in comparison to our bio analytical business performed very well throughout the year and net revenue in increased by percent in comparison to demand for our products and services increased across every market in which our life sciences and chemical analysis businesses operate 
in our electronic measurement business  net revenue in increased percent in comparison to the electronic measurement business saw reasonable growth in our general purpose test market and the communications test market declined slightly over last year 
growth for the electronic measurement segment was led by aerospace defense and wireline wireless research and development 
there was a reduction in revenues in the wireless manufacturing market during the year as the industry experienced excess capacity in handset test 
agilent s total net revenue in increased percent in comparison to net income was million in net income in was  million  which included the income from and gain on sale of our semiconductor products business for  million  the income from the discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business for million and a gain of million on the sale of our investment in lumileds 
net income in was million 
in  we generated operating cash flows of million and had cash and cash equivalents balance as of october  of  million 
in  we generated operating cash flows of million and had a cash and cash equivalents balance as of october  of  million 
the following significant events occurred in fiscal year in may  we entered into a five year credit agreement  which provides for a million unsecured credit facility that will expire in may  the company is not borrowing under the facility at this time  but may borrow under the facility from time to time as needs arise 
in june  we completed the acquisition of stratagene corporation previously announced in the second quarter of we paid approximately million cash for stratagene  or per share of their common stock 
the results of operations for stratagene have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in october  we completed a stock repurchase program of billion of common stock 
the program was originally announced in september and subsequently updated during the second quarter of to enable the accelerated repurchase of the remaining amount 
in october  we issued million of unsecured senior notes  discounted at and due for repayment in november we may redeem the notes at any time prior to their maturity and we would pay a redemption price equal to the greater of either of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed on the redemption date or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments 
in each case  accrued and unpaid interest would be paid up to but not including the redemption date 
upon the closing of the offering of the senior notes  we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the economic effect of these swaps will be to convert the fixed rate interest expense on the senior notes to a variable libor based interest rate 
looking forward  our continued focus will be to grow revenue at a faster rate than the electronic measurement and bio analytical markets  primarily through increasing market share  expanding our served market size with new products and channels and by complementary acquisitions 
our primary strategy is to pursue profitable growth by expanding our leadership in core adjacent markets and seeking revenue growth opportunities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may be different from the estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
those policies are revenue recognition  inventory valuation  investment impairments  share based compensation  retirement and post retirement plan assumptions  valuation of long lived assets and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we enter into agreements to sell products hardware or software  services  and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services 
revenue from product sales  net of trade discounts and allowances  is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
revenue is reduced for estimated product returns  when appropriate 
for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met 
for products that include installation  if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element  product revenue is recognized upon delivery  and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete 
otherwise  neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete 
revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use relative fair value or vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for software to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  whether fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish fair value for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
most of these conditions are subjective and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome  requiring future adjustments to revenue 
inventory valuation 
we assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage 
such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions 
the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge 
our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts  managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold to customers  resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 
investment impairments 
we recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our publicly traded equity securities and our cost method investments below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary 
significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment 
we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  including the severity and duration of the impairment  forecasted recovery  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
share based compensation 
we account for share based awards in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  shared based payment sfas no 
r which was effective november  for agilent 
under the standard  share based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value which generally uses the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized on a straight line basis for awards granted after november  over the vesting period of the award 
for awards issued prior to november   we recognize share based compensation expense based on fasb interpretation accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinions no 
and  which provides for accelerated expensing 
our estimate of share based compensation expense requires a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns expected life of the options  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
we consider several factors in estimating the expected life of our options granted  including the expected lives used by a peer group of companies and the historical option exercise behavior of our employees  which we believe are representative of future behavior 
we estimate the stock price volatility using the implied volatility of agilent s publicly traded stock options 
we have determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than a combined method of determining volatility 
in reaching this conclusion  we have considered many factors including the extent to which our options are traded and our ability to find traded options with similar terms and prices to the options we are valuing 
a percent increase in our estimated volatility from percent to percent for our most recent employee stock option grant would generally increase the value of an award and the associated compensation cost by approximately percent if no other factors were changed 
in the first quarter of  we revised our estimate of the expected life of our employee stock options from years to years 
in revising this estimate  we considered several factors  including the expected lives used by a peer group of companies and the historical option exercise behavior of our employees 
in the first quarter of  we granted the majority of our employee stock options to executive employees and the review of our data indicated that our executive employees  on average  exercise their options at years 
in  we granted restricted stock units rather than stock options to the majority of our employee base that received equity compensation 
see note  share based compensation  to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan assumptions 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business 
they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions 
to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations  we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long term return on plan assets 
other important assumptions include the health care cost trend rate  expected future salary increases  expected future increases to benefit payments  expected retirement dates  employee turnover  retiree mortality rates  and portfolio composition 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date october for us plans and september for non u 
s plans 
the us discount rates were determined by matching the expected plan benefit payments against an industry discount curve as well as a hypothetically constructed portfolio of high quality corporate bonds 
we also reviewed the movement of industry benchmarks from the prior year 
the discount rate increased slightly over the prior year to percent 
lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense  higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense 
the discount rate for non us plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds 
the expected long term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns 
a one percent change in the estimated long term return on plan assets for would result in a million impact on us pension expense and a million impact on us pension expense 
the net periodic pension and post retirement benefit costs recorded in continuing operations excluding curtailments and settlements were million in  million in and million in valuation of long lived assets 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of based on our estimates of forecasted discounted cash flows and our market capitalization at that time  we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired 
we have also assessed the recoverability of our long lived assets  by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows 
asset impairments primarily consist of property  plant and equipment and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment net of costs to sell 
during  we incurred million of asset impairment charges 
in addition  we recorded million of investment impairment charges during the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
we estimate expected future cash flows of our various businesses  which operate in a number of markets and geographical regions 
we then determine the carrying value of these businesses 
we exercise judgment in assigning and allocating certain assets and liabilities to these businesses 
we then compare the carrying value including goodwill and other intangibles to the discounted future cash flows 
if the total of future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
estimates of the future cash flows associated with the assets are critical to these assessments 
changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived assets such as our property  plant and equipment is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to  consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as the real estate market  industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized 
realization is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
during  we established valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets of the us and selected entities in foreign jurisdictions 
the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
during  we concluded that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our us federal deferred tax assets will be realized 
we did not conclude that any of our us state deferred tax assets would be similarly realized 
cumulative losses incurred by certain entities in foreign jurisdictions in recent years represent sufficient negative evidence  which make it difficult for positive evidence to overcome 
accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded in all instances 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance for these us state and foreign entities until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
profits or losses incurred in us states and by certain entities in foreign jurisdictions affect the ongoing amount of the valuation allowance 
we have not provided for all us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely 
should we decide to remit this income to the us in a future period  our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would be required 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
restructuring and asset impairment we initiated several restructuring plans in prior periods the plan  the plan and the plan prior plans 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  due to the then pending divestitures of our semiconductor products and semiconductor test businesses  we launched a new restructuring plan plan to reduce our workforce and facility footprint to match a smaller organizational size 
the workforce reduction portion of our plans are now substantially complete 
however  charges in connection with the consolidation of excess facilities continue to be recorded due to changes in market conditions from those originally expected at the date the liability for the excess facility was recorded 
payments will continue to be made related to these properties over the next four years 
in and we executed the plan and recorded restructuring charges of million in and million in workforce reduction expenses were million in and million in charges relating to facility impairments and adjustments to the accrual relating to the consolidation of excess facilities accounted for the remainder of the restructuring charge 
as of october   our accrual for pending workforce reduction costs was million  and the workforce reduction component of our restructuring plans is now substantially complete 
our accrual for the consolidation of excess facilities  decreased million from the prior year due to million of lease payments and a slight improvement in our assessments of potential recoveries from sub lease tenants in some of our vacant properties which led to a net reversal of million 
we continue to realign our businesses to the changing economic environment  although such actions do not constitute a restructuring plan as they have been and are expected to be independent actions undertaken from time to time  as appropriate  each of which have been or are expected to be individually immaterial 
total workforce management charges of approximately million have been incurred in in respect of these actions  with a further charge of approximately million expected in the restructuring accrual is recorded in other accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
for further details on our restructuring plans  see note  restructuring and asset impairment  to our consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency our revenues  costs and expenses  and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities 
we hedge revenues  expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis 
we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues  expenses  monetary assets and liabilities 
our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short term basis rolling twelve month period 
therefore  we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term 
for example  over the last three years the u 
s dollar has weakened against the euro and the british pound and although we successfully hedged currency movements in those currencies each year  we have experienced a net increase in reported expenses in europe as a result of currency fluctuations over this time period 
results from continuing operations in the beginning of the third quarter of  we moved the nanotechnology measurement business from the electronics measurement segment to the bio analytical measurement segment to more closely align with the new materials sciences business in that segment 
all historical segment numbers presented in this annual report on form k have been recast to conform to this change in reportable segments 
orders and net revenue years ended october  over change over change in millions orders    net revenue products    services and other total net revenue    years ended october  over ppts change over ppts change of total net revenue products ppt services and other ppt total net revenue in was  million  a percent increase over the  million net revenue recorded in net revenue in was  million  a percent increase over the  million net revenue recorded in the bio analytical measurement segment achieved strong revenue growth for the year of percent with increases in both life science and chemical analysis businesses 
in life science  there was sustained momentum due to the demand from biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers for the liquid chromatograph lc and liquid chromatograph mass spectroscopy lc ms platforms and microarrays 
in chemical analysis  growth was driven by demand in all markets  and in particular petrochemical environmental and food testing solutions 
our electronic measurement business saw a percent revenue growth overall with an increase in general purpose test  but a modest decline in the communication test business 
in the general purpose test business the aerospace defense market increased steadily over and the semiconductor markets were flat year over year 
the communications test business increased revenues in the wireless research and development market and the wireline market also increased in the year 
the wireless handset test market has been weak throughout the year  but there are now signs of stability 
services and other revenue include revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products  warranty extensions and consulting 
services and other revenue increased percent as compared to backlog on october   our unfilled orders were unchanged from last year for the electronic measurement business at approximately million 
on october   our unfilled orders for the bio analytical measurement business were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at october  we expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders for both businesses will be delivered to customers within nine months 
on average  our unfilled orders represent approximately two months worth of revenues 
in light of this experience  backlog on any particular date  while indicative of short term revenue performance  is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long term revenue performance 
costs and expenses years ended october  over change over change gross margin on products ppt ppts gross margin on services and other ppts total gross margin ppts ppts operating margin ppts ppts in millions research and development selling  general and administrative    in  total gross margin increased percentage point in comparison to operating margins in increased percentage points as compared to research and development expenditure has risen modestly and we have tightly controlled selling  general and administrative expenses during the year 
we experienced an unfavorable impact in gross and operating margins due to the comparative weakness of the us dollar and japanese yen denominated revenues against the euro and malaysian ringgit costs only partially offset by hedging gains 
operating margins in increased percentage points as compared to due to continued restructuring activities and tighter controls on spending 
gross inventory charges were million in  million in and million in sales of previously reserved inventory were million in  million in and million in our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies  none of which is individually significant to our operations 
we conduct five types of research and development basic research  which contributes to the fundamental understanding of areas critical to our future  foundation technologies  which enables fundamental advances across all businesses  communications  which creates technologies to enable pervasive access to information  life sciences  which enables next generation pharmaceuticals and improved patient outcomes  and measurement  which provides critical advances in test and measurement electronics and systems 
our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in electronics such as compound semiconductor devices  digital imaging systems and microfabrication technologies  software  systems and solutions such as applied mathematics  knowledge management and measurement science  life sciences such as computational biology  molecular diagnostics and high throughput measurements  and photonics  such as precision automation technology  optical switching and high speed optical links 
in each of these research fields  we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time horizon 
some of our product development research is designed to improve on the more than  products already in production  other research is on major new product releases  and yet other focused on developing new product segments for the future 
due to the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses  there are a number of drivers of this expense 
income from continuing operations in was million 
income from continuing operations in was  million  which includes a gain of million for the sale of our investment in lumileds  an equity investment 
at october   our headcount  on a continuing operations basis  was approximately  compared to  in and  in the increase in workforce is predominantly due to acquisitions and business expansion offset by reductions in infrastructure headcount 
provision for income taxes from continuing operations years ended october  in millions provision for income taxes for the year ended october   we recorded an income tax provision of million on continuing operations as compared with an income tax provision of million and million on continuing operations for the years ended october  and  respectively 
the provision was recorded for taxes on income generated in jurisdictions other than the us income or losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions were offset by adjustments to their respective valuation allowances 
for  the annual effective tax rate was percent on continuing operations 
the percent continuing operations tax rate reflects taxes at an effective tax rate of zero in the us due to a release of a significant portion of the valuation allowance and at low effective tax rates in other jurisdictions 
the low continuing operations tax rate includes a benefit of million related to valuation allowance adjustments based on changes in other comprehensive income items  portions of which are attributable to increases in currency translation adjustments and to increases in the value of certain stock investments 
in addition  the tax rate includes benefits totaling million related to the resolution of primarily non us tax issues associated with the spin off of agilent from hewlett packard 
for  the annual effective tax rate was percent on continuing operations 
the percent continuing operations tax rate reflects taxes on the sale of our lumileds joint venture at an effective tax rate of zero in the us due to the operation of the valuation allowance and at low effective tax rates in other jurisdictions 
in addition  the low continuing operations tax rate is a result of the million benefit related to the resolution of issues covered by a tax sharing agreement between agilent and hewlett packard 
the tax rate for continuing operations does not include the impact of income from low tax jurisdictions generated by our semiconductor products business and our semiconductor test solutions business which are now reported as discontinued operations 
for  the annual effective tax rate was percent on continuing operations 
this tax rate for continuing operations does not include the impact of income from low tax jurisdictions generated by our semiconductor products business and our semiconductor test solutions business which are now reported as discontinued operations 
additionally  the repatriation tax of the american jobs creation act of ajca caused a percent increase in the effective tax rate as during we decided to repatriate earnings on which we had not previously provided us taxes 
on october   the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca created a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we distributed cash from our foreign subsidiaries and reported an extraordinary dividend as defined in the ajca of million and a related tax liability of approximately million in our fiscal federal income tax return 
for  million of the million is provided for in the discontinued operations provision for income taxes  while the remaining is provided for in the continuing operations provision for income taxes 
agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions  most significantly in singapore  malaysia and switzerland 
the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment in those jurisdictions 
as a result of the incentives  the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
it is anticipated that these tax holidays will benefit agilent in a similar way in during  we established valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets of the us and certain entities in foreign jurisdictions 
the valuation allowances were determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
which require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
during  we concluded that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our us federal deferred tax assets will be realized 
we did not conclude that any of our us state deferred tax assets would be similarly realized 
cumulative losses incurred by certain entities in foreign jurisdictions in recent years represent sufficient negative evidence under sfas no 
to require full valuation allowances 
we intend to maintain full valuation allowances for these us state and foreign jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal 
our us federal income tax returns for through have been under audit by the internal revenue service irs 
in august  we received a revenue agent s report rar 
in the rar  the irs proposes to assess a net tax deficiency  after applying available net operating losses from the years under audit and undisputed tax credits  for those years of approximately million  plus penalties of approximately million and interest 
if the irs were to fully prevail  our net operating loss and tax credits generated in recent years would be utilized earlier than they otherwise would have been  and our annual effective tax rate will have increased as a result 
the rar addresses several issues 
one issue  however  relating to the use of agilent s brand name by our foreign affiliates  accounts for a majority of the claimed tax deficiency 
we believe that the claimed irs adjustment for this issue in particular is inconsistent with applicable tax laws and that we have meritorious defenses to this claim 
therefore we have not included any tax for this item in our tax provision for we have filed a formal protest and requested a conference with the appeals office of the irs and have opposed this claim  and most of the other claimed adjustments proposed in the rar  vigorously 
the final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain and may take several years 
based on current information  it is our opinion that the ultimate disposition of these matters is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
for all us and other tax jurisdictions  we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would be required 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliate and gain on sale lumileds agilent sold its interest in lumileds on november  lumileds was a global joint venture between agilent and koninklijkephilips electronics nv philips 
lumileds manufactures high power light emitting diodes and solid state lighting solutions 
pursuant to the share purchase agreement  upon closure of the sale transaction  the joint venture agreement and the ancillary agreements were terminated 
the purchase price paid by philips under the share purchase agreement was million 
in addition  lumileds repaid the million of outstanding principal debt and accrued interest under the credit agreement  dated as of november  our equity in the net income of our unconsolidated affiliate including the gain on sale of our interest in lumileds was million in and million in general infrastructure and shared services for agilent overall we have decreased our infrastructure costs compared to by million 
we have largely completed our restructuring activities and streamlined our operations 
we passed these savings on to all our businesses according to usage of related services 
we have reduced the number of employees in our workforce that provide support services such as finance  it and workplace services and moved many of our global shared services operations sites to lower cost regions 
the general infrastructure and shared services functions ended with approximately  employees  a decrease of approximately employees from one year ago and a decrease of approximately  employees from two years ago 
over the past two years  general infrastructure and shared services headcount has dropped by  people in the americas and europe and by people in asia

orders and net revenue years ended october  over change over change in millions orders    net revenue from products    net revenue from services and other total net revenue    electronic measurement business orders grew percent compared to on a geographic basis  order growth in the americas and europe was offset by declines in asia  most notably in japan 
order growth in was driven by strength in aerospace defense and general purpose markets  which was offset by declines in the wireless manufacturing and communications market 
from to orders increased percent due to growth in our wireless communication applications  as well as in signaling applications for the aerospace defense market 
electronic measurement business revenues increased percent year over year in general purpose revenues  representing approximately percent of our electronic measurement business  grew approximately percent 
our general purpose revenues are made up of sales into the general purpose  computer and semiconductor  and aerospace defense markets 
our general purpose market business continues to experience solid growth due to ongoing global economic expansion and steady consumer electronics spending 
the computer and semiconductor market business was essentially flat year over year  while our aerospace defense market business continued to grow due to on going demand for signaling and communication solutions in defense related applications  such as satellite  electronic monitoring  explosive device detection  and electronic warfare systems 
communications test revenues  representing approximately percent of our electronic measurement business  declined percent 
communications test revenues are made up of sales into the wireless test  wireline test and wireless design software markets 
wireless manufacturing test application business was down compared to  offset by growth in our wireless r d  wireline and wireless design software business 
in revenue grew percent with a segment profile similar to in which growth in general purpose markets was offset by declines in our communications test business 
looking forward  we project continued opportunities for growth in our electronic measurement business driven by on going wireless g coverage and services expansion  as well as broadband and triple play voice data video applications 
we remain cautiously optimistic with regard to the aerospace defense market s overall spending growth in the areas of signal intelligence  communications  surveillance and electronic warfare 
this growth potential could be mitigated by potential slowdowns in spending on new communication technologies  government budget limitations and computer and semiconductor market investment

we contributed million and million to our non us defined benefit plans in and  respectively 
our non us defined benefit plans are generally funded ratably throughout the year 
total contributions in were million or percent less than due largely to an approximate million contribution to verigy pension plans in our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities  among other factors 
the reduced funding amounts in the us were due to an improved funded status 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our us and us defined benefit plans during net cash provided by used in investing activities of continuing operations net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations in was million compared to  million generated in cash generation in was high due to the divestiture of our semiconductor products business for billion  net of transaction costs and taxes

we received cash of million in october  the notes will mature on november   bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum  payable semi annually on may and november of each year  commencing on may  upon the closing of the offering of the senior notes  we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million 
under the interest rate swaps we will receive fixed rate interest payments and will make payments based on the six month us dollar libor 
the economic effect of these swaps will be to convert the fixed rate interest expense on the senior notes to a variable libor based interest rate 
in january  agilent technologies world trade  inc  a consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of agilent world trade  entered into a master repurchase agreement and related confirmation together  the repurchase agreement with a third party pursuant to which world trade sold  class a preferred shares of one of its wholly owned subsidiaries having an aggregate liquidation preference of billion 
pursuant to the repurchase agreement  world trade is obligated to repurchase from the third party those preferred shares for percent of their aggregate liquidation preference in january the billion obligation of our subsidiary to repurchase the preferred shares has been classified as long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet 
off balance sheet arrangements and other we have contractual commitments for non cancelable operating leases 
see note commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non cancelable operating leases 
our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets 
our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world 
local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances 
we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 
on december   moody s investors service moody s upgraded their corporate family rating and probability of default rating of agilent from ba to ba and revised their rating outlook to positive  leaving unchanged the speculative grade liquidity rating of sgl 
on january   standard poor s rating services s p raised its corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings of agilent to bbb from bb  with a stable ratings outlook 
on march   moody s lowered its outlook to stable from positive due to the company s announcement to accelerate its shares repurchase program 
on march   fitch ratings initiated coverage of agilent by assigning an issuer default rating of bbb with stable outlook 
contractual commitments our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  inventory management  and the timing of tax and other payments 
as a result  the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 
the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october  for continuing operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in millions less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating leases commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers other purchase commitments retirement plans total operating leases 
commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property 
commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers 
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates 
however  our agreements with these suppliers usually allow us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within days are non cancelable 
therefore  only approximately percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable  and unconditional commitments 
we expect to fulfill all purchase commitments for inventory within one year 
in addition to the above  we record a liability for firm  non cancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory 
as of october   the liability for our firm  non cancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments was million  compared with million as of october  these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
other purchase commitments 
these relate primarily to contracts with professional services suppliers 
purchase commitments are typically cancelable within a day period without significant penalties 
we had no material off balance sheet arrangements as of october  or october  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries 
we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance 
our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise wide basis 
this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments  including option and forward contracts  to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them 
we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
our operations generate non functional currency cash flows such as revenues  third party vendor payments and inter company payments 
in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market  we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk 
approximately percent of our revenues in  percent of our revenues in and percent of our revenues in were generated in us dollars 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of october  and october   the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
