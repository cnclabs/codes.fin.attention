item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risk and uncertainties 
words such as expects  goals  plans believes  contains  may  and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
in addition  any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance  our anticipated growth and trends in our business  and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those discussed in item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
independent directors stock option investigation and restatement of financial statements in may  certain analysts published reports suggesting that asyst may have granted stock options in the past with favorable exercise prices in certain periods compared to stock prices before or after grant date 
in response to such reports  management began an informal review of the company s past stock option grant practices 
on june   the sec sent a letter to the company requesting a voluntary production of documents relating to past option grants 
on june   the company s board of directors appointed a special committee of three independent directors to conduct a formal investigation into past stock option grants and practices 
the special committee retained independent legal counsel and independent forensic and technical specialists to assist in the investigation 
the special committee s investigation was completed on september   with the delivery of the committee s final report on that date 
the investigation covered option grants made to all employees  directors and consultants during the period from january through june the special committee found instances wherein incorrect measurement dates were used to account for certain option grants 
the special committee concluded that none of the incorrect measurement dates was the result of fraud 
the last stock option for which the measurement date was found to be in error was granted in february specifically  the special committee determined that there was an insufficient basis to rely on the company s process and relating documentation to support recorded measurement dates used to account for most stock options granted primarily during calendar years through  the company had numerous grants 
table of contents made by means of unanimous written consents signed by board or compensation committee members wherein all the signatures of the members were not received on the grant date specified in the consents  the company made several company wide grants pursuant to an approval of the board or compensation committee  but the list of grantees and number of options allocated to each grantee was not finalized as of the stated grant date 
the special committee also found that  during the period from april through february  the company set the grant date and exercise price of rank and file employee option grants for new hires and promotions at the lowest price of the first five business days of the month following the month of their hire or promotion 
however  the net impact of this practice was an aggregate charge of less than  the special committee identified isolated instances where stock option grants did not comply with applicable terms and conditions of the stock plans from which the grants were issued 
for example  the committee determined that on two occasions  the company granted options to directors that exceeded the annual automatic grant amount specified in the applicable plan 
on another occasion  a grant to a director was approved one day before the individual became a director 
in addition  one grant was made to an officer of the company by the chief executive officer under delegated authority  however  under the terms of the applicable plan  the option grant should have been made by the company s board or its compensation committee 
there were also isolated instances where option grants were made below fair market value 
the applicable stock option plans require that option grants must be made at fair market value on the date of grant 
however  the committee did not find any evidence that these violations were fraudulent or committed for improper purposes 
the special committee s investigation also identified less frequent errors in other categories  such as grants made to a small number of employees who had not formally commenced their employment as of the grant approval date 
the special committee concluded that the errors in measurement dates it reviewed resulted primarily from a combination of unintentional errors  lack of attention to timely paperwork  and insufficient internal control over aspects of equity plan administration including lack of oversight in applying the accounting rule described below in connection with determining measurement dates during the period in which the errors occurred 
the special committee found no evidence that any incorrect measurement dates was the result of fraud 
to determine the correct measurement dates under applicable accounting principles for these options  the committee followed the guidance in accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 
 which deems the measurement date as the first date on which all of the following are known the individual employee who is entitled to receive the option grant  the number of options that an individual employee is entitled to receive  and the option s purchase price 
in instances where the special committee determined it could not rely on the original stock option grant date  the special committee determined corrected measurement dates based on its ability to establish or confirm  whether through other documentation  consistent or established company practice or processes  or credible circumstantial information  that all requirements for the proper granting of an option had been satisfied under applicable accounting principles 
based on the results of the special committee s investigation  the company recorded share based compensation charges and additional payroll taxes with respect to its employee stock option grants for which the measurement dates were found to be in error 
while the impact of recording these charges was not material to the fiscal year ended march   the company deemed it appropriate to record the charges in the relevant periods  since recording the cumulative out of period charges in fiscal would be material to that period 
accordingly  the company restated the results of fiscal year  to record a net charge of approximately million  or per share  in fiscal and million to its accumulated deficit as of april  for cumulative changes relating to fiscal years prior to fiscal year at march   the deferred share based compensation charge resulting from the investigation was fully amortized 
in view of its history of operating losses  the company has maintained a full valuation allowance on its us deferred tax assets since fiscal year as a result  there is no material income tax impact relating to the share based compensation and payroll tax expenses recorded by the company resulting from the investigation of the special committee during the fiscal years ended march    and additionally  there was no 
table of contents material impact of section a and section m limitations on deduction of executive stock compensation for the fiscal years ended march    and cost of restatement and legal activities the option grant investigation was time consuming  and required asyst to incur significant additional expenses of approximately million in fiscal year  and required significant management attention and resources during this period 
in addition  certain of the current and former directors and officers of the company have been named as defendants in two consolidated shareholder derivative actions filed in the united states district court of california  captioned in re asyst technologies  inc derivative litigation nd cal 
the federal action  and one similar shareholder derivative action filed in california state court  captioned forlenzo v 
schwartz  et al 
alameda county superior court the state action 
both actions seek to recover unspecified monetary damages  disgorgement of profits and benefits  equitable and injunctive relief  and attorneys fees and costs 
the state action also seeks the imposition of a constructive trust on all proceeds derived from the exercise of allegedly improper stock option grants 
the company is named as a nominal defendant in both the federal and state actions  thus no recovery against the company is sought 
we are not able to predict the future outcome of these legal actions 
these matters could result in significant legal expenses  diversion of management s attention from our business  commencement of formal civil or criminal administrative or litigation actions against asyst or current or former employees or directors  significant fines or penalties  indemnity commitments to current and former officers and directors and other material harm to our business 
the sec may also disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported or not reported the financial impact of past option grant measurement date errors or other potential accounting errors  and there is a risk that any review or subsequent investigation could lead to circumstances in which we may have to further restate our prior financial statements  amend prior sec filings  or otherwise take other actions not presently contemplated 
any such circumstance could also lead to future delays in filing of our subsequent sec reports  and consequent risks of defaults under debt obligations and de listing of our common stock 
overview we develop  manufacture  sell and support integrated automation systems  primarily for the worldwide semiconductor and fpd manufacturing industries 
we principally sell directly to the semiconductor and fpd manufacturing industries 
we also sell to oems that make production equipment for sale to semiconductor manufacturers 
our strategy is to offer integrated automation systems that enable semiconductor and fpd manufacturers to increase their manufacturing productivity and yield and to protect their investment in fragile materials during the manufacturing process 
a substantial portion of our revenues are invoiced in japanese yen and subject to currency fluctuation rates 
the assets and liabilities of these japanese operations and their subsidiaries are generally translated using period end exchange rates 
translation adjustments are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets 
on october   we established a joint venture with shinko  called asi 
the joint venture develops  manufactures  sells and supports amhs  with principal operations in tokyo and ise  japan 
under terms of the joint venture agreement  we acquired percent of the joint venture for approximately million of cash and transaction costs 
shinko contributed its entire amhs business  including intellectual property and other assets  installed customer base and approximately employees  and retained the remaining percent interest 
on july   the company purchased from shinko shares representing an additional percent of the outstanding capital stock of asi for approximately million of cash and transaction costs 
this purchase increased asyst s consolidated ownership of asi to percent 
the company consummated the acquisition to further integrate its fab automation and automated material handling systems amhs businesses  allowing it to provide its customers a full range of product offerings 

table of contents the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of july   the effective date of the acquisition  and the results of operations were included in our condensed consolidated results of operations subsequent to july  we believe the purchase price reasonably reflects the fair value of the business based on estimates of future revenues and earnings 
our fab automation and our automated material handling systems amhs represent two reportable segments the fab automation product segment  which consists principally of our interface products  auto id systems  substrate handling robotics  sorters  connectivity software  and continuous flow technology cft 
the amhs segment  which consists principally of our automated transport and loading systems  semiconductor and flat panel display products 
we believe critical success factors include manufacturing cost reduction  product quality  customer relationships  and continued demand for our products 
demand for our products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors  including  but not limited to  changes in global economic conditions  fluctuations in the semiconductor equipment market  changes in customer buying patterns due to technological advancement and or capacity requirements  the relative competitiveness of our products  and our ability to manage successfully the outsourcing of our manufacturing activities to meet our customers demands for our products and services 
for this and other reasons  our results of operations for the fiscal year ended march   may not be indicative of future operating results 
we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follow to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements  the primary factors that resulted in those changes  and how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of long lived assets  asset impairments  restructuring charges  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
some of our products are large volume consumables that are tested to industry and or customer acceptance criteria prior to shipment and delivery 
our primary shipping terms are fob shipping point 
therefore  revenue for these types of products is recognized when title transfers 
certain of our product sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
we allocate consideration to multiple element transactions based on relative objective evidence of fair values  which we determine based on prices charged for such items when sold on a stand alone basis 
if we have met defined customer acceptance experience levels with both the customer and the specific type of equipment  we recognize the product revenue at the time of shipment and transfer of title  with the remainder when the other elements  primarily installation  have been completed 
some of our other products are highly customized systems and cannot be completed or adequately tested to customer specifications prior to shipment from 
table of contents the factory 
we do not recognize revenue for these products until formal acceptance by the customer 
revenue for spare parts sales is recognized at the time of shipment and the transfer of title 
deferred revenue consists primarily of product shipments creating legally enforceable receivables that did not meet our revenue recognition policy 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is not significant and is included in accrued liabilities and other 
we recognize revenue for long term contracts in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we use the percentage of completion method to calculate revenue and related costs of these contracts because they are long term in nature and estimates of cost to complete and extent of progress toward completion of long term contracts are available and reasonably dependable 
we record revenue and unbilled receivables each period based on the percentage of completion to date on each contract  measured by costs incurred to date relative to the total estimated costs of each contract 
the unbilled receivables amount is reclassified to trade receivables once an invoice is issued 
we disclose material changes in our financial results that result from changes in estimates 
we account for software revenue in accordance with the aicpa sop  software revenue recognition 
revenue for integration software work is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
software license revenue  which is not material to the consolidated financial statements  is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specifically identified amounts  as well as a portion of the reserve calculated based on the aging of receivables 
the additional reserve is provided for the remaining accounts receivable after specific allowances at a range of percentages from percent to percent based on the aging of receivables 
if circumstances change such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  or its payment trends  we may adjust our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us 
inventory reserves we evaluate the recoverability of all inventory  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts  to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required 
inventory which is obsolete or in excess of our demand forecast is fully reserved 
such provisions  once established  are not reversed until the related inventories have been sold or scrapped 
if actual demand is lower than our forecast  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we outsource a majority of our fab automation product manufacturing to solectron 
as part of the arrangement  solectron purchases inventory for our benefit and we may be obligated to acquire inventory purchased by solectron if the inventory is not used over certain specified periods of time 
no revenue is recorded for the sale of inventory to solectron and any inventory buyback in excess of our demand forecast is fully reserved 
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform an annual goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of each fiscal year using a two step process 
the first step of the test identifies when impairment may have occurred  while the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
to determine the amount of the impairment  we estimate the fair value of our reporting segments that contain goodwill  based primarily on expected future cash flows  reduce the amount by the fair value of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill also based primarily on expected future cash flows  and then compare the unallocated fair value of the business to the carrying value of goodwill 
to the extent goodwill exceeds the unallocated fair value of the business  an impairment expense is recognized 
in connection with the annual impairment analysis for goodwill  we assessed the recoverability of the intangible assets subject to amortization in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement fasb of financial 
table of contents accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 

warranty reserve our warranty policy generally states that we will provide warranty coverage for a pre determined amount of time  generally to months  for material and labor to repair and service our equipment 
we record the estimated warranty cost upon shipment of our products or receipt of customer s final acceptance 
the estimated warranty cost is determined based on the warranty term and historical warranty costs for a specific product 
if actual product failure rates or material usage differs from our estimates  we may need to revise our estimated warranty reserve 
accounting for income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered our future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing our valuation allowance 
future taxable income is based upon our estimates  and actual results may significantly differ from these estimates due to the volatility of our industry 
if in the future we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax in excess of the net amount recorded  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset  increasing income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset  charging income in the period such determination was made 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived tangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the assets and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets is based on the fair value of the assets 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
share based compensation on april   the company adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
the company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended march  reflect the impact of sfas no 
r 
however  in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s consolidated financial statements for prior periods were not restated and do not include the impact of sfas no 
r 
prior periods do not include equity compensation amounts comparable to those included in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended march  sfas no 
r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
prior to april   the company accounted for share based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb no 
as permitted under sfas no 
r and further amended by sfas no 

upon adoption of sfas no 
r  the company reassessed its equity compensation valuation method and related assumptions 
the company s determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant utilizes an option pricing model  and is impacted by its common stock price as well as a change in 
table of contents assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards  as well as the projected employee option exercise behaviors expected period between stock option vesting date and stock option exercise date 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value  in the company s opinion  the existing black scholes option pricing model may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with sfas no 
r using an option pricing model that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
share based compensation expense recognized in the company s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended march  included a combination of payment awards granted prior to april  and payment awards granted subsequent to april  in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company changed its method of attributing the value of share based compensation to expense from the accelerated multiple option approach to the straight line single option method 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted subsequent to april  is recognized using the straight line single option method  except for compensation expense relating to market condition awards which is recognized using the graded vesting method 
share based compensation expense included in the year ended march  includes the impact of estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
for the periods prior to fiscal  the company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
stock options granted in periods prior to fiscal were measured based on sfas no 
criteria  whereas stock options granted subsequent to april  were measured based on sfas no 
r criteria

net sales for the amhs segment were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the net sales for fiscal year increased by million  or percent over the prior year primarily due to a million volume increase in semiconductor equipment sales in japan  and a million increase in service sales  partially offset by a million volume decrease in flat panel sales to customers located in taiwan and korea 
the amhs semiconductor volumes increased during fiscal year as manufacturers of flash memory  and foundries in asia pacific and japan continued with their fab expansion projects 
fab automation net sales were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and respectively 
the net sales for fiscal year increased by million  or percent  over the prior year primarily due to a million volume increase in mm and mm loadport sales  a million volume increase in spartan sorter and efem sales  and a million increase in spare parts and service contract sales partially offset by lower sales of other products totaling million 
spartan efem continued to ramp throughout fiscal year as there were several new design wins  which resulted in unit volumes increasing by approximately percent over the prior fiscal year net sales for the fiscal year ended march  were million  a decrease of million or percent  from the prior year 
selling price erosion was not a primary contributor to the decrease in net sales for the period 
the decrease in fiscal year sales volume was attributable to sales decreases in our amhs segment of million  primarily due to fpd declines of million and mm products of million 
the fpd decline was the result of completion of a very large project in the prior year 
this was partially offset by sales 
table of contents volume increases of million for services and sales of our mm product line increasing by an additional million

the million increase in united states and europe for the fiscal year was primarily due to the amhs volume increase of million and the fab automation volume increase of million 
the consolidated net sales for fiscal year was million  which decreased by million from fiscal year net sales in japan and europe increased by million for fiscal year compared with  however  this was more than offset by the volume decrease of million in taiwan due to flat panel display  and a million decrease for the united states  korea  and other asia pacific geographies 
gross profit consolidated gross profit was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and respectively 
the gross profit for the fiscal year decreased by million  or percent  from the prior fiscal year 
the primary reason for the decline was due to amhs projects for the fiscal year ended march  having lower average gross margins than projects during the prior fiscal year 
during the prior fiscal year ended march   several amhs contracts were completed with lower costs than originally estimated due to conservative cost expectations 
this resulted in a higher overall gross margin percentage

amhs gross profit was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and respectively 
the gross profit for the fiscal year decreased by million or percent from the prior fiscal year  and was attributed to several contracts in the prior year that concluded with lower costs than anticipated  resulting in an overall increase in the gross margin percentage in fiscal year in addition to the prior year including lower costs to complete several contracts fiscal year gross profit reflected customer

the amhs gross margins were percent  percent and percent for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
fab automation gross profit was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and respectively 
the gross profit increased by million over the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in mm and mm loadport volume  an increase in spartan sorter and efem volume  as well as the increase in spare parts and service contracts 
the fab automation gross margins were percent  percent and percent for the fiscal years ended march   and respectively 
the gross margin increased from percent to percent in the fiscal year primarily due to favorable product mix and volume from the mm loadports  and continued product cost reductions through outsourced manufacturing and a lower cost supply chain 
in fiscal year  we reduced our fixed manufacturing costs across all business lines  with gross profit increasing by million  even though net sales decreased by million compared to the prior year 
a major factor contributing to our gross margin improvement  is based on our poc revenue model at asi  with completion of projects in fy that had begun in fy or earlier and the related recognition of revenue that had been deferred or unbilled 
in fiscal year  we also worked on a very large fpd project that had lower margins  thereby explaining the improved product mix and overall gross margin as a percent of net sales in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year research and development fiscal year ended march  fiscal year ended march  change change in thousands  except percentage research and development percentage of total net sales research and development r d expenses were million for the fiscal year ended march   compared with million for the fiscal year r d expenses increased by million in fiscal year  compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to a million increase in headcount related costs  which included payroll  fringe benefits  and bonuses  a million increase in share based compensation expense  a million non cash expense for in process research and development as part of the asi purchase transaction completed during the second quarter of fiscal year  partially offset by million of lower prototype material and other miscellaneous expenses r d expenses were million for fiscal year  which represented a decrease of million from fiscal year the r d expense decrease was primarily due to a million reduction of headcount related costs from reductions in workforce  lower depreciation expense of million  and lower miscellaneous expenses of million 
the research and development expenses may vary as a percentage of net sales because we do not manage these expenditures strictly to variations in our level of net sales 
rather  we establish annual budgets that management believes are necessary for enhancements to our current products and for developing new products and product lines 
selling  general and administrative fiscal year ended march  fiscal year ended march  change change in thousands  except percentage selling  general and administrative percentage of total net sales selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million for fiscal year  compared with million and for the fiscal year fiscal year sg a expenses increased by million  
table of contents compared with fiscal year  primarily due to a million increase in headcount related costs which included payroll  fringe benefits  and bonuses  a million increase in legal and accounting expenses associated with the stock option investigation which occurred during the second and third quarters of fiscal year and the ongoing jenoptik litigation  a million increase in share based compensation expense  and an increase of million for all other miscellaneous expenses 
the above increases totaled million  and they were partially offset by a million reduction in bad debt allowance during the fiscal year due to cash collections 
sg a expenses for fiscal year increased by million  compared with fiscal year expenses of million 
the primary reason for the increase was due to a million increase related to auditing and the review and testing of internal controls over financial reporting required under the sarbanes oxley act of  an increase of million in our bad debt allowance and an increase of million in other fixed and payroll costs due to higher headcount in order to meet the increased financial and accounting requirements  and a million increase in other miscellaneous expenses 
amortization of acquired intangible assets fiscal year ended march  fiscal year ended march  change change in thousands  except percentage amortization of acquired intangible assets percentage of total net sales we amortize acquired intangible assets over periods ranging from three to ten years 
the increase of million in amortization expense in the year ended march   compared to the year ended march  is primarily due to the increase in intangible assets of approximately million from the purchase of additional shares in asi in fiscal year the decrease in amortization in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year in the amount of million was primarily due to assets being fully amortized during fiscal year restructuring charges credits the restructuring accrual and related utilization for fiscal years ended march   and were as follows in thousands severance and excess benefits facilities total balance  march  additional accruals amounts paid in cash foreign currency translation adjustment balance  march  reduction in accruals non cash related utilization amounts paid in cash foreign currency translation adjustment balance  march  additional accruals non cash related utilization amounts paid in cash balance  march  during fiscal year  the company incurred restructuring charges of million related to excess facility charges in connection with our corporate office relocation 
the outstanding accrual amount at march   as noted in the table above  consists of future lease obligations on vacated facilities 

table of contents in fiscal year  we recorded minor changes in estimates to our restructuring accrual as a result of completion of various lease and sub lease agreements  as well as final payments and adjustments on severance and benefit programs that were included in prior restructurings 
the outstanding accrual balance of million at march  consisted of future lease obligations on operating leases  which were fully paid in fiscal year in fiscal year  we recorded net severance and other charges of million  primarily for severance costs from a reduction in workforce in december at that time  we announced a restructuring initiative in our fab automation reporting segment  which involved the termination of employment of approximately employees 
asset impairment charges in conjunction with the restructuring in fiscal year  we had removed from service and made available for sale certain land and a building owned by aji 
our building in nagoya  japan had been underutilized since a prior decision to outsource the manufacturing of our next generation robotics products  part of an overall strategy to outsource the manufacture of all our fab automation segment products 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write the assets down to their estimated fair value  based on a market valuation  less cost to sell 
we accounted for these assets as held for sale under sfas no 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we re evaluated the status of the aji facility discussed above and based on an assessment of our expected future business needs  we reclassified the assets  as held and used 
there were no asset impairment charges in fiscal years ended march  or interest and other income expense  net fiscal year ended march  fiscal year ended march  change change in thousands interest income interest expense other income  net total  net interest and other income expense  net  was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the change in fiscal year was primarily due to the acquisition of an additional percent of the outstanding shares in asi  which required million of cash and new borrowings with bank of america of approximately million 
the new borrowings resulted in an increase in interest expense of million  and the use of million in cash resulted in a decrease in interest income of million 
the remaining difference in other income of approximately million was due to a reduction in royalty income 
the increase in fiscal year over fiscal year was due to non recurring royalty income of approximately million becoming due to us upon achievement of certain contractual milestones from our royalty partner on our licensed products and interest income of million due to higher investment balances and interest rate 
provision for benefit from income taxes fiscal year ended march  fiscal year ended march  change change in thousands  except percentage provision for benefit from income taxes percentage of total net sales

accounts payable increased  primarily due to million increase at asi for planned inventory requirements for next year 
the increase in net inventory is primarily attributed to inventory build up at asi of approximately million in order to meet increased demand and backlog orders at year end 
significant changes in assets and liabilities during the fiscal year ended march  included accounts receivable  which decreased due to increased cash collections at asi  including receipts from the factoring of certain receivable balances in japan and a decline in revenues  prepaid expenses and other assets  which decreased 
table of contents due to a vat refund at asi from the japanese government  and accounts payable to related parties  which decreased at asi by million as described in note  related party transactions

we continue to improve our days sales outstanding dso  which have decreased to days at march  from days at march   compared to days at march  for billed and unbilled receivables 
the improvement in dso was primarily due to better cash collections 
the decrease in unbilled receivables at march  compared to march  was attributable to the decreases in revenues of asi and completion of projects started in earlier periods 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at march  over those of march  was mainly attributable to higher collection of receivable and subsequent cash applied to payable balances at asi and aji  coupled with lower revenue in the business 
our inventory turns were times for the fiscal year  compared to times for fiscal year  primarily due to additional inventory to support the increase in backlog from million at march  to million at march  we expect that cash used in or provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  collection of accounts receivable  timing of payments  and inventory levels 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year this was due primarily to the purchase from shinko shares of asi representing an additional percent of outstanding capital stock of asi for a cash purchase price of jpy billion approximately us million at the july  exchange rate

debt financing facility 
in june  our japanese subsidiary  aji  established a million  three year  senior secured revolving credit and term loan facility  consisting of a million revolving credit facility  including a million sub limit for letters of credit and million sub limit for swing line loans  and a million term loan facility 
the credit facility was arranged by banc of america securities llc 
bank of america  na  will serve as administrative agent 
a syndicate of lenders and financial institutions  including comerica  development bank of japan  key bank  and union bank of california  is participating in the facility with bank of america 
we have the ability to borrow us dollars or japanese yen under the facility 
substantially all of this facility is guaranteed by the company in the united states 
the interest on these loans is based on a variable rate over the japanese yen libor london interbank offered rate 
as of march   the interest on the revolver was percent and the rate on the term loan was percent 
we are amortizing approximately million of financing costs over the life of the facility 
the credit agreement will terminate and all amounts outstanding will be due july   provided that asyst s outstanding percent convertible subordinated notes due july   are redeemed or repurchased  or the maturity of the notes extended  on terms reasonably satisfactory to the administrative agent on or before march   otherwise  amounts outstanding under the credit agreement will be due on march  we may not be able to negotiate an extension of the maturity of all of the convertible notes in a manner satisfactory to the senior lenders under the secured credit facility  or on economic terms acceptable to us 
if we fail to re negotiate an extension  then the existing terms of the senior credit facility call for full repayment of that obligation on march  we believe that our current cash position will be sufficient to meet our expected cash requirements related to this obligation 
the bank of america credit agreement contains financial and other covenants  including  but not limited to  limitations on liens  mergers  sales of assets  capital expenditures  and indebtedness as well as the maintenance of a maximum total leverage ratio  maximum senior leverage ratio  and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the agreement 
additionally  although we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock in the past and do not anticipate paying any such cash dividends in the foreseeable future  the facility restricts our ability to pay such dividends subject to certain exceptions  including the dividend payments from asi to shinko provided under the share purchase agreement described in item in this report 
nonpayment of amounts due  a violation of these covenants or the occurrence of other events of default set forth in the credit agreement including a cross default under the indenture could result in a default permitting the termination of the lenders commitments under the credit agreement and or the acceleration of any loan amounts then outstanding 
the company is in compliance with the debt covenants as of march   and believes it will continue to be in compliance for the next twelve months 
on july   asyst and aji purchased from shinko shares of asi representing an additional percent of outstanding capital stock of asi for a cash purchase price of jpy billion approximately us million at the july exchange rate 
this purchase increased asyst s consolidated ownership of asi to percent 
as of that date  we borrowed an aggregate amount of approximately million under the senior credit facility to fund 
table of contents the purchase of shares reported above and for general working capital purposes  and issued a letter of credit in favor of shinko for approximately million related to the equity option on shinko s remaining percent asi share ownership 
as of march   we have a total of approximately million outstanding under the bank of america senior credit facility 
at any time as of or after the first anniversary of the closing  and subject to the other provisions of the share purchase agreement  either shinko or aji may give notice to the other  calling for aji to purchase from shinko shares representing the remaining percent of outstanding capital stock of asi for a fixed payment of jpy billion approximately million at the march  exchange rate 
under certain circumstances  shinko can accelerate upon thirty days written notice our obligation to purchase the remaining percent equity it holds in asi 
these circumstances include a when the equity ownership of asyst japan  inc aji in asi falls below percent  b when bankruptcy or corporate reorganization proceedings are filed against the company or aji  c when a merger or corporate reorganization has been approved involving all or substantially all of the company s assets  d when shinko s equity ownership in asi falls below percent  or e when the company has failed to make any payment when due in respect of any loan secured by a pledge of the company s right  title and interest in and to the shares of asi and the holder of such security interest elects to exercise its rights against aji in respect of such shares 
in any such event  an acceleration could impose on us an unforeseen payment obligation  which could impact our liquidity or which payment could be subject to restrictions or covenants  or be subject to third party approvals under our debt facilities 
our inability to purchase the remaining asi equity held by shinko  when and as required  could significantly impact our continued control and ownership of asi 
due to the cyclical and uncertain nature of cash flows and collections from our customers  the company or its subsidiaries may from time to time incur borrowings which could cause the company to exceed the permitted total leverage ratios under the credit agreement 
under any such scenario  the company may pay down the outstanding borrowings from cash to maintain compliance with its financial covenants 
other debt financing arrangements 
we have approximately million outstanding under our percent convertible subordinated notes privately issued in july these notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
we are required to pay interest on these convertible notes on january and july of each year 
these notes mature july  and are currently redeemable at our option 
asi has revolving lines of credit with four japanese banks 
these lines allow aggregate borrowing of up to billion japanese yen  or approximately million at the exchange rate as of march  asi s lines of credit carry original terms of six months to one year  at variable interest rates based on the tokyo interbank offered rate tibor which was percent at march  plus margins of percent to percent 
under the terms of certain of these lines of credit  asi generally is required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants  including requirements to report an annual net profit on a statutory basis and to maintain at least percent of the equity reported as of its prior fiscal year end 
asi was in compliance with these covenants at march  none of these lines requires collateral and none of these lines requires guarantees from us or our subsidiaries in the event of default by asi 
in june  we amended two of these lines of credit representing billion yen  or approximately million  of borrowing capacity to extend the expiry dates to june   at which time all amounts outstanding under these four lines of credit will be due and payable  unless the lines of credit are extended 
as of march   asi had no outstanding borrowings  and a total of billion japanese yen available under these lines of credit 
as of march   aji had term loans outstanding with one japanese bank 
these loans are repayable monthly until february and may the loans carry annual interest rates between percent and percent  respectively 
substantially all of these loans are guaranteed by the company in the united states 
as of march   aji had outstanding borrowings of million japanese yen  or approximately million at exchange rates as of march  existing lines of credit total million as of march   and consisted of the bank of america million revolving credit facility at aji which is part of the million credit agreement with bank of 
table of contents america and the million revolving lines of credit at asi  both of which are discussed above 
approximately million of these lines was available to the company  however  million is restricted to support our obligations  under the terms of the share purchase agreement to purchase from shinko its remaining percent equity interest in asi  and million is restricted due to debt covenant ratio restrictions  bringing the net available credit under all of the company s credit facilities to million at march  other liquidity considerations 
since inception  we have incurred aggregate consolidated net losses of approximately million  and have incurred losses over the last six years 
in recent years  we have funded our operations primarily from cash generated from the issuance of debt or equity securities 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments aggregated million at march  we believe that our current cash position and the availability of additional financing via existing lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our expected cash requirements for at least the next months 
our borrowing arrangements require that we comply with certain financial covenants 
we expect that asi will continue to require additional funding to support its working capital requirements over the next twelve months  which may be financed through short term borrowings or inter company cash transfers 
while we expect to meet such financial covenants  we cannot give absolute assurance that we will meet these financial covenants  including those contained in the senior secured credit facility 
specifically  we are required to maintain compliance with covenants establishing minimum ebitda operating performance by the company as a ratio of our total borrowing available under the senior secured credit facility 
the terms of the bank of america million senior secured credit facility require us to redeem or repurchase  or extend the maturity of the notes  on terms reasonably satisfactory to bank of america on or before march   otherwise  amounts outstanding under the credit facility will be due on march  our failure in any fiscal quarter to meet this and other covenant requirements could result in a reduction of our permitted borrowing under the facility  an acceleration of certain repayment obligations  and or an event of default which  if uncured by us or not waived by the lenders  under the terms of the facility  would require the acceleration of all re payment obligations under the facility 
alternatively  due to the cyclical and uncertain nature of cash flows and collections from our customers  the company s borrowings to fund operations or working capital could exceed the permitted total leverage ratios under the credit agreement 
under any such scenario  the company may be required pay down the outstanding borrowings from cash to maintain compliance with its financial covenants 
if we are unable to meet any such covenants or pay down outstanding borrowings as required  we cannot assure the requisite lenders will grant waivers and or amend the covenants  or that the requisite lenders will not terminate the credit agreement  preclude further borrowings or require us to repay immediately in full any outstanding borrowings 
accordingly  our ability to fund operations and working capital requirements through additional borrowing may be substantially impaired and limit our ability to grow our company or sustain or improve profitability 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry makes it very difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
any upturn in the semiconductor industry may result in short term uses of cash in operations as cash may be used to finance additional working capital requirements such as accounts receivable and inventories 
alternatively  continuation or further softening of demand for our products may cause us to fund additional losses in the future 
at some point in the future we may require additional funds to support our working capital and operating expense requirements or for other purposes 
we may seek to raise these additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings  or the sale of assets 
these financings may not be available to us on a timely basis  if at all  or  if available  on terms acceptable to us or not dilutive to our shareholders 
if we fail to obtain acceptable additional financing  we may be required to reduce planned expenditures or forego investments  which could reduce our revenues  increase our losses  and harm our business 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes  such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing or other risks that could arise if we had such relationships 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years short term loans and notes payable long term debt  including interest capital lease obligations  including interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations total only non cancelable purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are included in the table above 
as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are liable  as part of the original asi acquisition in fiscal year  to provide funding for plan benefits under asi s pension plan 
as of march  and  the liability was million and million  respectively 
on june   we entered into an agreement to acquire from shinko the remaining asi shares we did not already own 
this purchase increased our consolidated ownership of asi to percent at the closing on july   while shinko retained ownership of a percent equity interest 
at any time as of the first anniversary of the closing  and subject to the other provisions of the agreement  either shinko or we may give notice to the other calling for us to purchase from shinko this remaining percent equity for a fixed payment of jpy billion approximately us million at the march  exchange rate 
under certain circumstances  shinko can accelerate upon thirty days written notice this purchase obligation 
these circumstances include a when our equity ownership in asi falls below percent  b when bankruptcy or corporate reorganization proceedings are filed against us or our subsidiary aji which holds ownership of the shares in asi  c when a merger or corporate reorganization has been approved involving all or substantially all of the company s assets  d when shinko s equity ownership in asi falls below percent  or e when the company has failed to make any payment when due in respect of any loan secured by a pledge of the company s right  title and interest in and to the shares of asi and the holder of such security interest elects to exercise its rights against aji in respect of such shares 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
as of march   our portfolio consisted entirely of investments in highly liquid money market funds 
therefore  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
the company adopted a foreign exchange policy that documented how we intend to comply with the accounting guidance under sfas no 
under the policy there are guidelines that permit the company to have hedge accounting treatment under both fair value and cash flow hedges 
the policy approval limits are up to million with our chief financial officer s approval and over million with the additional approval of the our chief executive officer 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates for the investment portfolio at march  as a general matter  our intent is not to hold investments longer than twelve months remaining principal weighted average maturities amount interest rate in thousands cash equivalents institutional money market funds within year  total cash equivalents 
table of contents we also have short term debt  long term debt  capital leases and convertible notes totaling approximately million at march  approximately million of these borrowings have a fixed interest rate 
we have approximately million of floating interest rate debt  all of which are yen denominated 
we do not hedge against the risk of interest rate changes for our floating rate debt and could be negatively affected should these rates increase significantly 
a percent increase in the levels of interest rates  with all other variables held constant  would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in interest expense for the twelve months ended march  the fair market value of the convertible subordinated notes issued by asyst and due in july is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the notes 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of the notes will also increase as the market price of asyst stock increases and decrease as the market price falls 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the convertible subordinated notes but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we engage in international operations and transact business in various foreign countries 
the primary source of foreign currency cash flows is japan and to a lesser extent asia and europe 
although we operate and sell products in various global markets  substantially all sales are denominated in us dollars  except in japan 
to date  the foreign currency transactions and exposure to exchange rate volatility have not been significant 
although we do not anticipate any significant fluctuations  there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange risk will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flow in the future 
the following table presents our net loss  assuming a hypothetical strengthening and weakening of the japanese yen by percent and percent  respectively  compared to the average rate used during the fiscal year ended march  in thousands no change in strengthening in japanese japanese yen weakening in japanese yen of x percent exchange yen of x percent rate net income loss for the fiscal year ended march
