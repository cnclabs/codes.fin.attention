item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with arbitron s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto that follow in this form k 
overview arbitron is a leading international media and marketing information services firm primarily serving radio  cable television  advertising agencies  advertisers  out of home media  online media and  through its scarborough research joint venture with the nielsen company  broadcast television and print media 

table of contents known trends that management considers material significant customers 
historically  the company s quantitative radio measurement services and related software have accounted for a substantial majority of its total revenues 
consolidation in the radio broadcasting industry has led to a concentration of ownership of radio stations and  consequently  arbitron s dependence on a limited number of key customers for such services and related software has increased 
in  clear channel and cbs radio represented approximately percent and nine percent  respectively  of arbitron s total revenue 
the company s agreements with these customers are not exclusive and do not contain automatic renewal obligations 
arbitron currently has license agreements with clear channel to provide radio ratings and software services for clear channel s radio stations and networks through arbitron s fall survey 
in may  arbitron announced that it had entered into a license agreement with cbs radio to provide diary based services and ppm radio ratings  when the new ratings technology is deployed  through arbitron s winter survey 
slow growth in diary business 
due to slow economic growth of the radio industry generally  as well as the high penetration of its current services in the radio station business  arbitron expects that its future annual organic rate of revenue growth from its quantitative diary based radio measurement services and related software will be slower than historical trends 
the company anticipates that in the near term organic revenue growth will only moderately exceed the level of contractual price escalators in its radio ratings contracts 
electronic measurement initiatives 
arbitron has announced its plan to progressively roll out its ppm ratings service to the top radio markets by philadelphia became the first radio market to be electronically measured in january also in january  the company announced that the media rating council mrc had accredited the ppm radio ratings data in houston  which had been the company s ppm demonstration market since mid the company also is actively exploring opportunities to leverage its ppm technologies for strategic applications in addition to its quantitative radio measurement services 
in this regard  the company has formed project apollo llc  a jointly owned limited liability company with nielsen media research  inc nmr to explore the feasibility of the commercialization of a national marketing service panel 
commercialization of the ppm radio ratings service and exploration of other strategic applications of the ppm technology  including the national marketing panel service  will require a substantial financial investment 
the company believes that during the ppm roll out period its cost of revenue will increase and substantial capital expenditures will be incurred to build its fixed costs structure and support future large scale ppm commercialization efforts 
in addition  the company expects that its expenses will increase as a result of continued deployment costs associated with the national marketing panel service and the strategic development of its electronic ratings business 
ultimately  arbitron believes that  while commercialization of the ppm ratings service and other strategic applications of the ppm technology will have a near term negative impact on its results of operations  its operating margins can be restored through the completion of the ppm transition process in the top radio markets  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
response rates and sample proportionality arbitron must achieve response rates sufficient to maintain confidence in its ratings  the support of the industry and accreditation by the media rating council 
overall response rates have declined over the past several years and it has become increasingly difficult and more costly for the company to obtain consent from persons to participate in its surveys 
another measure often used by clients to assess quality in arbitron s surveys is proportionality  which refers to how well the distribution of the sample for any individual survey matches the distribution of the population in the market 
in recent years  arbitron s ability to deliver good proportionality in its surveys among younger demographic groups has deteriorated  caused in part by the trend among some households to disconnect their landline phones  effectively removing these households from the arbitron sample frame 
arbitron has committed extensive efforts and resources to address the decline of response rates and to maintain sample proportionality 
in march  arbitron announced a comprehensive set of initiatives to bolster response rates and improve sample proportionality among african american  hispanic  and young male respondents in arbitron s diary based markets 
these initiatives include providing for substantial increases in cash incentives and other survey treatments 

table of contents management believes that significant additional expenditures will be required in the future with respect to response rates and sample proportionality 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k and  in particular  this management s discussion and analysis  contain or incorporate a number of forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate and management s beliefs and assumptions 
any statements contained herein including without limitation statements to the effect that arbitron or its management believes  expects  anticipates  plans  and similar expressions that are not statements of historical fact should be considered forward looking statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
there are a number of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those included in this annual report on form k in item a risk factors 
we do not intend to update publicly any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
stock repurchases on january   arbitron announced that its board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of its outstanding common stock through either periodic open market or private transactions at then prevailing market prices through december  as of june   the program was completed with million shares repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of million 
on november   arbitron announced that its board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of its outstanding common stock through either periodic open market or private transactions at then prevailing market prices over a period of two years through november as of february   no shares were repurchased under this program 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are both important to the presentation of arbitron s financial position and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
arbitron capitalizes software development costs with respect to significant internal use software initiatives or enhancements in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the costs are capitalized from the time that the preliminary project stage is completed and management considers it probable that the software will be used to perform the function intended  until the time the software is placed in service for its intended use 
once the software is placed in service  the capitalized costs are amortized over periods of three to five years 
management performs an assessment quarterly to determine if it is probable that all capitalized software will be used to perform its intended function 
if an impairment exists  the software cost is written down to estimated fair value 
during the year ended december   arbitron recorded an impairment charge of million for internally developed ppm software associated with the nmr election not to join arbitron in the commercial deployment of the ppm system 
as of december   and  arbitron s capitalized software developed for internal use had carrying amounts of million and million  respectively  including million and million  respectively  of software related to the ppm system 
arbitron uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine the current provision for income taxes and also deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
assumptions  judgments  and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
changes in tax law or interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in 
table of contents the consolidated financial statements 
assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account forecasts of the amount and nature of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and nature of income in future years could render current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause actual income tax obligations to differ from estimates  thus impacting arbitron s financial position and results of operations

ebit increased to million and ebitda increased to million in from million and million  respectively  in liquidity and capital resources working capital was million and million as of december   and  respectively 
the million decrease in working capital was primarily due to arbitron using million of available cash and short term investments to prepay its senior secured notes obligation on october  excluding the deferred revenue liability  which does not require a significant additional cash outlay by arbitron  working capital was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in addition  short term investments and receivables from brokers  collectively  were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
management expects that arbitron s cash position  along with these readily convertible assets  as of december   and cash flow generated from operations and its available revolving credit facility will be sufficient to support arbitron s operations for the foreseeable future 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly attributable to a million decrease in net income  and a million decrease related to the excess tax benefit from stock option exercises for the year ended december  the decrease related to excess tax benefit from stock option exercises continue to be presented as an operating activity for in accordance with the modified prospective adoption of sfas no

r adoption and a million increase in deferred taxes 
increased operating expenses significantly decreased net income 
these expenses included planned expenses required to build arbitron s ppm panels for markets other than houston  operate the houston panel and develop the national marketing research service through the project apollo pilot panel 
net cash provided by operating activities was further impacted by a million increase related to accrued expenses and other current liabilities substantially due to a million reversal of certain tax contingencies and other items in  partially offset by a million decrease in cash flow for increased purchases of ppm international inventory in net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   and net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  the million increase in cash provided by investing activities was driven primarily by the full year impact of increased net sales of short term investments of million 
arbitron s investment in available for sale variable rate demand notes issued by municipal government agencies and auction rate securities began in the fourth quarter ended december  
table of contents in addition  arbitron acquired integrated radio systems  llc on september  for million 
however  no acquisitions were made during the year ended december  these increases in cash flow from investing activities for the year ended december   as compared to the same period of were partially offset by increased capital spending of million  which was largely related to ppm metering equipment purchases during for the ppm ratings service 
net cash used in financing activities was million and million for the year ended december   and  respectively 
the million fluctuation in financing activities was primarily attributable to the million debt prepayment of arbitron s senior secured note on october  and a million increase in repurchases of arbitron s outstanding common stock during the year ended december   as compared to the same period in the million decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises was the result of significantly fewer options nearing expiration and lower average stock prices for the year ended december   as compared to the same period of arbitron s first quarterly dividend payment to company stockholders was paid in april a million increase in dividend payments resulted for the year ended december   as compared to the same period of because four quarterly dividend payments to company stockholders were made during  as compared to the three payments made during the same period of these increases in net cash used in financing activities were partially offset by a million increase in realized tax benefits related to share based awards  which in accordance with sfas no 
r  is required to be presented prospectively in arbitron s cash flow statement as a financing activity rather than as an operating activity for periods subsequent to january   the adoption date for sfas no 
r 
on october   arbitron prepaid its senior secured notes obligation using million of its available cash and short term investments 
under the original terms of the note agreement  the notes carried a fixed interest rate of and a maturity date of january  in accordance with the provisions of the note agreement  arbitron was obligated to pay an additional make whole interest amount of million 
on december   arbitron entered into an agreement with a consortium of lenders to provide up to million of financing to arbitron through a five year  unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility 
the agreement permits arbitron to increase the financing available under the credit facility up to million provided that any number of lenders are willing to increase the size of their commitment 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility will be calculated based on a floating rate for a duration of up to six months as selected by arbitron 
arbitron s credit facility contains financial terms  covenants and operating restrictions that potentially restrict financial flexibility 
under the terms of the credit facility  arbitron is required to maintain certain leverage and coverage ratios and meet other financial conditions 
the agreement contains certain financial covenants and limits  among other things  arbitron s ability to sell assets  incur additional indebtedness  and grant or incur liens on its assets 
under the terms of the credit facility  all of arbitron s material domestic subsidiaries  if any  guarantee the commitment 
currently  arbitron does not have any material domestic subsidiaries as defined under the terms of the credit facility 
although the management of arbitron does not believe that the terms of its credit facility limit the operation of its business in any material respect  the terms of the credit facility may restrict or prohibit arbitron s ability to raise additional debt capital when needed or could prevent arbitron from investing in other growth initiatives 
arbitron has been in compliance with the terms of the credit facility since its inception 
arbitron announced on february   that its board of directors the board approved the payment of arbitron s first quarterly cash dividend 
since that time the board has continued to approve the payment of quarterly dividends of 
per common share to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on the th of each quarter end month 
for  a quarterly dividend payment was made in the month subsequent to each quarter end 
on january   arbitron announced that its board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of its outstanding common stock through either periodic open market or private transactions at then prevailing market prices through december  as of june   the program was completed with approximately million shares repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of million 

table of contents on november   arbitron announced that its board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of its outstanding common stock through either periodic open market or private transactions at then prevailing market prices through november as of february   no shares were repurchased under this program 
commercialization of the ppm ratings service will require a substantial financial investment 
arbitron believes it has sufficient cash and short term investments as well as access to the credit facility to fund such requirements 
arbitron currently estimates that the aggregate capital expenditure associated with ppm ratings service commercialization for audience ratings measurement will be approximately million over the first two to three years of commercialization 
arbitron also anticipates that  over the same period  its results of operations will be materially negatively impacted as a result of the rollout of this ppm ratings service 
ultimately  however  arbitron believes that  while commercialization of ppm ratings service will have a near term negative impact on arbitron s results of operations  its operating margins can be restored through the completion of the ppm transition process in the top radio markets  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
the amount of capital required for deployment of the ppm ratings service and the impact of the rollout on arbitron s results of operations will be greatly affected by the speed with which the radio industry requests the ppm ratings service and the timing of the rollout 
if the radio industry is slow to accept the ppm ratings service  as opposed to the use of diaries or some other competing alternative  then it will take longer to roll out the commercialization of the ppm ratings service  and the costs associated with that deployment will be delayed 
on the other hand  if the radio industry asks for electronic measurement sooner rather than later  arbitron s capital needs will accelerate  and the near term negative impact on arbitron s results of operations will be more significant 
the national marketing research service is a new service  however  for which market acceptance is not yet known 
this service would require substantial additional expenditures if it ultimately proves to be a viable commercial service 
during the year ended december   the company incurred approximately million of net expenditures relating to the national marketing pilot 
if a decision is made to commercialize this service  substantial additional expenditures would be incurred during the next few years 
since the pilot program for the national marketing service is in progress and customer response is preliminary  it is not yet possible to provide a meaningful assessment of future costs associated with a potential commercialization of this service 
however  the same general cost pattern would apply as with the ppm ratings service  which is that substantial costs would have to be incurred in advance of revenues 
this would result in a negative impact on results of operations in the first three to four years of commercialization  which impact likely would be material 
arbitron expects to fund the pilot program for the national marketing service  and the expected commercialization of the ppm radio ratings service with its existing cash position and short term investments  future cash from operations or through the most advantageous source of capital at the time  which may include borrowings under its current credit facility  sales of common and preferred stock and or joint venture transactions 
arbitron believes that one or more of these sources of capital will be available to fund its ppm related cash needs  but there can be no assurance that the external sources of capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all
