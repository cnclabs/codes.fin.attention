overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and marketer of next generation life science tools and integrated systems for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and biological function 
using our proprietary technologies  we provide a comprehensive line of products and services that currently serve the sequencing  genotyping and gene expression markets  and we expect to enter the market for molecular diagnostics 
our customers include leading genomic research centers  pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions  clinical research organizations and biotechnology companies 
our tools provide researchers around the world with the performance  throughput  cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to perform the billions of genetic tests needed to extract valuable medical information from advances in genomics and proteomics 
we believe this information will enable researchers to correlate genetic variation and biological function  which will enhance drug discovery and clinical research  allow diseases to be detected earlier and permit better choices of drugs for individual patients 

table of contents on january   we completed the acquisition of solexa for approximately million shares of our common stock 
solexa develops and commercializes genetic analysis technologies used to perform a range of analyses including whole genome resequencing  gene expressing analysis and small rna analysis 
we believe our combined company is the only company with genome scale technology for genotyping  gene expression and sequencing  the three cornerstones of modern genetic analysis 
our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of high value products and service projects  the impact of seasonal spending patterns  the timing and size of research projects our customers perform  changes in overall spending levels in the life science industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect our customer ordering patterns 
any significant delays in the commercial launch or any lack or delay of commercial acceptance of new products  unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines  or impacts from the other factors mentioned above  could adversely affect our revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and net income or loss  we believe quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
prior to  we incurred substantial operating losses 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million and total stockholders equity was million 
losses prior to have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for the research  development and manufacturing scale up effort required to commercialize our products and services  an acquired in process research and development charge of million related to our acquisition of cyvera in and a charge of million in related to a termination of employment lawsuit 
we expect to continue to incur substantial costs for research  development and manufacturing scale up activities over the next several years 
we will also need to increase our selling  general and administrative costs as we build up our sales and marketing infrastructure to expand and support the sale of systems  other products and services 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements requires that management make estimates  assumptions and judgments with respect to the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies are deemed critical if they require an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  or different estimates that we reasonably could have used would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services 
product revenue consists of sales of arrays  reagents  instrumentation and oligos 
service and other revenue consists of revenue received for performing genotyping services  extended warranty sales and revenue earned from milestone payments 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product or system is required  revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met 
all revenue is recorded net of any applicable allowances for returns or discounts 
revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer  provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of instrumentation is recognized when earned  which is generally upon shipment 
however  in the case of beadlabs  revenue is recognized upon the completion of installation  training and customer acceptance 
revenue for genotyping services is recognized when earned  which is generally at the time the genotyping analysis data is delivered to the customer or as specific milestones are achieved 
in order to assess whether the price is fixed and determinable  we ensure there are no refund rights 
if payment terms are based on future performance or a right of return exists  we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed and determinable 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured  revenue recognition is deferred until the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
sales of instrumentation generally include a standard one year warranty 
we also sell separately priced maintenance extended warranty contracts  which are generally for one or two years  upon the expiration of the initial warranty 
revenue for extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term of the extended warranty period 
reserves are provided for estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated revenue is recognized 
if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing our warrantied products were greater than our estimates  gross margins could be adversely affected 
while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  we do enter into agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  provides guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  or rights to use assets within contractually binding arrangements 
significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements  when to recognize revenue for each element  and the period over which revenue should be recognized 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine that the fair values of undelivered elements are known and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 

table of contents some of our agreements contain multiple elements that include milestone payments 
revenue from a milestone achievement is recognized when earned  as evidenced by acknowledgement from our collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii the milestone represents the culmination of an earnings process  iii the milestone payment is non refundable and iv the performance obligations for both us and our collaborators after the milestone achievement will continue at a level comparable to the level before the milestone achievement 
if all of these criteria are not met  the milestone achievement is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement 
we defer non refundable upfront fees received under our collaborations and recognize them over the period the related services are provided or over the estimated collaboration term using various factors specific to the collaboration 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
research revenue consists of amounts earned under research agreements with government grants  which is recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze customer accounts  review the length of time receivables are outstanding and review historical loss rates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances could be required 
inventory valuation we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess  obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value 
we must make assumptions about future demand  market conditions and the release of new products that will supercede old ones 
we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components  taking into account product life cycle and development plans  product expiration and quality issues  historical experience and our current inventory levels 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated  additional inventory adjustments could be required 
contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to intellectual property matters 
based on the information available at the balance sheet dates and through consultation with our legal counsel  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of these matters  as well as the potential ranges of probable losses 
if losses are probable and reasonably estimable  we will record a liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
currently  we have no such liabilities recorded 
this may change in the future depending upon new developments 
income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved 
the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  and includes a review of all available positive and negative evidence 

table of contents due to the adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  we recognize excess tax benefits associated with share based compensation to stockholders equity only when realized 
when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to share based compensation have been realized  we follow the with and without approach excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax deductions 
under this approach  excess tax benefits related to share based compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 
goodwill and intangible asset valuation the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to at least annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other acquired intangible assets impact future amortization  and the amount assigned to ipr d is expensed immediately 
determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets especially requires the exercise of judgment 
while there are a number of different acceptable generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired  we primarily use the discounted cash flow method 
this method requires significant management judgment to forecast the future operating results used in the analysis 
in addition  other significant estimates are required such as residual growth rates and discount factors 
the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination 
determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions  including projection and timing of future cash flows  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables  and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
it is reasonably possible that the plans and estimates used to value these assets may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
as of december   we had million of goodwill 
this goodwill is reported as a separate line item in the balance sheet 
we have performed our annual test of goodwill as of may  and have determined there has been no impairment of goodwill as of december  stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the bsm model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of these assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

table of contents results of operations to enhance comparability  the following table sets forth audited consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended december   january   and january  stated as a percentage of total revenue

revenue year ended year ended december  january  percentage change in thousands product revenue service and other revenue research revenue total revenue total revenue for the years ended december  and january  was million and million  respectively 
this represents an increase of million for  or  compared to 
table of contents product revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended january  the increase in resulted primarily from higher consumable and beadstation sales 
growth in consumable revenue was primarily attributable to the launch and shipment of our whole genome genotyping products  the humanhap and humanhap beadchips 
in addition  growth in consumable revenue can be attributed to the growth in our installed base of beadarray readers  which has nearly doubled since january  consumable products constituted of product revenue for year ended december   compared to in the year ended january  we expect to see continued growth in product revenue  which can be partially attributed to the launch of several new products  as well as the growth of our installed base of instruments 
service and other revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended january  the increase in service and other revenue is primarily due to the completion of several significant infinium and goldengate snp genotyping service contracts 
we introduced our infinium services in early we expect sales from snp genotyping services contracts to fluctuate on a yearly and quarterly basis  depending on the mix and number of contracts that are completed 
the timing of completion of a snp genotyping services contract is highly dependent on the customer s schedule for delivering the snps and samples to us 
government grants and other research funding decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended january   due primarily to the completion of several projects funded by grants from the national institutes of health 
we do not expect research revenue to be a material component of our revenue going forward 
cost of product and service and other revenue year ended year ended december  january  percentage change in thousands cost of product revenue cost of service and other revenue total cost of product and service and other revenue cost of product and service and other revenue represents manufacturing costs incurred in the production process  including component materials  assembly labor and overhead  installation  warranty  packaging and delivery costs  as well as costs associated with performing genotyping services on behalf of our customers 
costs related to research revenue are included in research and development expense 
cost of product revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended january   primarily driven by higher consumable and instrument sales 
cost of product revenue for the year ended december  included stock based compensation expenses resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r totaling million 
gross margin on product revenue increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended january  the increase in gross margin percentage is primarily due to the impact of favorable product mix  as well as decreased manufacturing costs 
a higher percentage of our revenue in was generated from the sale of consumables  which generally have a more favorable gross margin than other products 
the decrease in manufacturing costs is primarily due to reduced raw material costs as a result of more favorable negotiated contracts with our vendors and improvements in our manufacturing processes 
this increase in gross margin was offset  in part  by the impact of stock based compensation charges  which decreased our gross margin by basis points in compared to cost of service and other revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended january   primarily due to higher service revenue 
cost of service and other revenue for the year ended december  included stock based 
table of contents compensation expenses resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r totaling million 
gross margin on service and other revenue decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended january  the decrease is due primarily to a change in the mix of projects  as well as the impact of stock based compensation charges  the latter having decreased our service and other revenue gross margin by basis points in compared to we expect product mix to continue to affect our future gross margins 
however  we expect our market to become increasingly price competitive and our margins may fluctuate from year to year and quarter to quarter 
research and development expenses year ended year ended december  january  percentage change in thousands research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
we expense our research and development expenses as they are incurred 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended january  research and development expenses for the years ended december  and january  included stock based compensation expenses primarily resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r totaling million and million  respectively 
exclusive of these stock based compensation charges  the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  is primarily due to the development of our recently acquired veracode technology purchased in conjunction with our acquisition of cyvera in april the company plans to launch its first products resulting from this acquisition during the first quarter of research and development expenses related to the veracode technology increased million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended january  in addition  costs to support our oligator technology platform and beadarray research activities decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended january  we believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to remaining competitive and expanding into additional markets 
accordingly  we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our product base and integrate the operations of solexa into our business 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended year ended december  january  percentage change in thousands selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing  finance  human resources  business development  legal and general management  as well as professional fees  such as expenses for legal and accounting services

r totaling million and million  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased million during the year ended december   compared to the year ended january  the increase is primarily due to increases of million attributable to personnel related expenses  million of stock based compensation expense and 
table of contents million attributable to other non personnel related costs  mainly sales and marketing activities for our existing and new products 
general and administrative expenses increased million during the year ended december   compared to the year ended january   due to increases of million of stock based compensation expense  million in outside legal costs related to the affymetrix litigation  million in personnel related expenses associated with the growth of our business and million in outside consulting costs 
outside consulting costs primarily include tax and audit fees and general legal expenses not associated with the affymetrix litigation 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our staff  add sales and marketing infrastructure  incur increased litigation costs and incur additional costs to support the growth in our business 
interest income year ended year ended december  january  percentage change in thousands interest income interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was million and million for the years ended december  and january   respectively 
the increase was due to higher average cash balances and higher effective interest rates compared to the prior year

in  the provision for income taxes consisted of income tax expense related to foreign operations 

table of contents during the year ended december   we utilized approximately million and million of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  respectively  to reduce our federal and state income taxes 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in and  respectively  unless previously utilized 
in addition  we also had us federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million respectively  which begin to expire in and respectively  unless previously utilized 
pursuant to section and of the internal revenue code  utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant future changes in our ownership structure 
these annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization 
previous limitations due to section and have been reflected in the deferred tax assets as of december  based upon the available evidence as of december   we are not able to conclude it is more likely than not the remaining deferred tax assets in the us will be realized 
therefore  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the us deferred tax assets of approximately million

this represents an increase of million for  or  compared to product revenue increased to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the increase in was primarily due to higher beadstation  consumable and  to a lesser extent  oligo sales 
growth in consumable sales was due to the launch of several new products  as well as the growth in our installed base of beadstations 
as of january   we had shipped a total of beadarray readers 
service and other revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in service and other revenue was primarily due to higher demand for third party snp genotyping service contracts during the period 
in addition  due to the achievement of a milestone associated with our collaboration agreement with invitrogen  we recognized revenue of million in the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by decreased revenue related to the international hapmap project 
we completed all revenue generating genotyping services for the international hapmap project early in the first quarter of we expect sales from third party snp genotyping services contracts to fluctuate on a yearly and quarterly basis  depending on the mix and number of contracts that are completed 
the timing of completion of a snp genotyping services contract is highly dependent on the customer s schedule for delivering the snps and samples to us

gross margin on product revenue decreased to for the year ended january   compared to for the year ended january  the decrease in gross margin percentage is primarily due to the impact of product mix 
a higher percentage of our revenue in was generated from the sale of instrumentation  which generally has a lower gross margin than other products 
other factors contributing to the decrease include decreased gross margins related to our consumable and oligo sales 
lower consumable margins can be primarily attributed to lower average selling prices on consumable sales in  compared to  which were partially offset by decreased manufacturing costs 
in addition  the gross margin associated with oligo products sold as a part of the invitrogen collaboration was lower when compared to the prior year 
the change in oligo gross margin was due to the fact that  under the invitrogen collaboration  we no longer sell oligos directly 
as a result  the gross margin related to this product line decreased  however  the net margin has increased due to the fact that most of the sales and marketing expenses surrounding the oligo business have shifted to our collaboration partner  invitrogen 
cost of service and other revenue increased to million for the year ended january   compared to million for the year ended january  gross margin on service and other revenue decreased to for the year ended january  from in the year ended january  the decrease is due primarily to a change in the mix of projects and decreased average selling prices

table of contents in february  we issued million principal amount of convertible senior notes due the net proceeds from the offering  after deducting the initial purchasers discount and offering expenses  were approximately million 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds to purchase shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the offering 
we used million of the net proceeds of this offering to pay the cost of convertible note hedge and warrant transactions  which are designed to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes 
we intend to use the balance of the net proceeds for other general corporate purposes  which may include acquisitions and additional purchases of our common stock 
the notes mature on february  and bear interest semi annually at a rate of per year  payable on february and august of each year  beginning on august  in addition  we may in certain circumstances be obligated to pay additional interest

however  the notes will be convertible at any time from  and including  november  through the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding february  we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and income from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for at least the next twelve months 
operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business  including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
at the present time  we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
however  our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including the successful resolution of our legal proceedings with affymetrix  our ability to successfully commercialize our sequencing systems and to expand our snp genotyping services product lines  scientific progress in our research and development programs  the magnitude of those programs  competing technological and market developments and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings 
therefore  we may require additional funding in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio  and we believe a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange risk although most of our revenue is realized in us dollars  some portions of our revenue are realized in foreign currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
the functional currencies of our subsidiaries are their respective local currencies 
accordingly  the accounts of these operations are translated from the local currency to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date for the balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity 

table of contents periodically  we hedge significant foreign currency firm sales commitments and accounts receivable with forward contracts 
we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks  we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures and they generally have terms of one year or less 
these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly  to the extent effective  any unrealized gains or losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are reported in other comprehensive income 
realized gains and losses for the effective portion are recognized with the underlying hedge transaction 
as of december   we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
the notional settlement amount of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december  and january  were and million  respectively 
as of january   we had one outstanding contract with an immaterial fair value  representing an unrealized gain  which was included in other current assets at january  we settled foreign exchange contracts of million and million for the years ended december  and january   respectively 
we did not hold any derivative financial instruments prior to fiscal
