improving merchandise assortment and product mix the company tailors the product mix of its stores toward regional tastes in order to optimize the productivity of its stores  seeking to serve key customer segments within each store 
this involves tailoring the overall square footage allocation in line with a store s trend  and increasing inventory and square footage allocations for growth categories 
as music sales have continued to decline on an industry wide basis  the company has been able to offset the impact by shifting square footage allocations from music to home video  video game  and other product categories

changes in gross profit are impacted primarily by sales levels  mix of products sold  vendor discounts and allowances and distribution costs 
the company records its distribution and product shrink expenses in cost of sales

management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to merchandise inventory and return costs  valuation of long lived assets  income taxes  stock based compensation  and accounting for gift card liability 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

the average cost method attaches a cost to each item and is a blended average of the original purchase price and those of subsequent purchases or other cost adjustments throughout the life cycle of that item 
inventory valuation requires significant judgment and estimates  including obsolescence  shrink and any adjustments to market value  if market value is lower than cost 
inherent in the entertainment software industry is the risk of obsolete inventory 
typically  newer releases generate a higher product demand 
some vendors offer credits to reduce the cost of products that are selling more slowly  thus allowing for a reduction in the selling price and reducing the possibility for items to become obsolete 
the company records obsolescence and any adjustments to market value if lower than cost based on current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  and market conditions 
the provision for inventory shrink is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last date a physical inventory was performed to the end of the fiscal year

physical inventories are taken at least annually for all stores throughout the year and inventory records are adjusted accordingly

the company incurred merchandise return charges in its fiscal years  and of million  million and million  respectively 
return penalties were lower in fiscal than in prior years as the major vendors have decreased the up front incentives and in turn  lowered the back end penalty rate 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets to determine if any part of the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that the company considers to be important when assessing impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of acquired assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  if the company determines that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable  it tests for impairment to determine if an impairment charge is needed

the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
accounting for income taxes requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding interpretation of various taxing jurisdictions  laws and regulations as well as the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets 
these estimates and judgments include the generation of future taxable income  viable tax planning strategies and support of tax filings 
valuation allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets if  based upon management s estimates of realizability  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of these deferred tax assets will not be realized

stock based compensation the company s adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  in the first quarter of required that the company recognize stock based compensation expense associated with the vesting of share based instruments in the statement of operations 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires the company to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
the company calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes model requires the company to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility the estimated stock price volatility was derived based upon the company s actual historic stock prices over the expected life of the options  which represents the company s best estimate of expected volatility 
expected option life the company s estimate of an expected option life was calculated based on actual historical data relating to grants  exercises and cancellations 
risk free interest rate the company used the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected life assumption as the risk free interest rate 
the amount of stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
the company reviewed historical forfeiture data and determined the appropriate forfeiture rate based on that data 
the company will re evaluate this analysis periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary 
ultimately  the company will recognize the actual expense over the vesting period only for the shares that vest 
accounting for gift card liability the company sells gift cards that are redeemable only for merchandise and have no expiration date 
the company derecognizes card liability when either customers redeem cards  at which point the company records revenue  or the company determines it does not have a legal obligation to remit unredeemed cards to the relevant jurisdictions and the likelihood of the cards being redeemed becomes remote  at which point the company records breakage as a credit to sg a expenses 
the company s accounting for gift cards is based on estimating the company s liability for future card redemptions at the end of a reporting period 
estimated liability is equal to two years of unredeemed cards  plus an amount for outstanding cards that may possibly be redeemed for the cumulative look back period  exclusive of the last two years 
the company s ability to reasonably and reliably estimate the liability is based on historical redemption experience with gift cards and similar types of arrangements and the existence of a large volume of relatively homogeneous transactions 
the company s estimate is not susceptible to significant external factors and the circumstances around gift card sales and redemptions have not changed significantly over time

additionally  the measurement of the tax position will be based on the largest amount that is determined to have greater than a likelihood of realization upon ultimate settlement
