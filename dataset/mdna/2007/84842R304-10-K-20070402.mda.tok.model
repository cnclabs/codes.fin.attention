item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company operates via two principal segments  biospherix and infospherix 
biospherix develops proprietary products for commercial applications 
infospherix provides contact center information and reservation services for government and industry 
infospherix generates substantially all of the company s revenue 
in   and  infospherix generated substantially all of its revenue from government customers 
the company has developed a niche in providing campground and other reservation services via its reserveworld business line  which accounted for approximately   and of the company s revenue in   and during  the company won a reservation contract for the state of maine  and the re compete of the contracts from the states of indiana and minnesota 
the company s national park service contract ended january  biospherix engages in product development  notably tagatose 
the rights to manufacture tagatose have been licensed to arla along with the rights to sell tagatose for food and beverage uses 
our licensee has not been successful in marketing tagatose for food and beverage uses and has announced a cessation of further product manufacturing 
accordingly  we have focused our efforts on non food use of tagatose  which we will market under the name naturlose 
our principal efforts have been to explore whether naturlose is an effective treatment for type diabetes 
we are about to commence a phase clinical trial for this purpose 
results of operations compared with in  the company reported a net income of million per diluted share on revenue of million for the year  compared with a net loss of million per diluted share on revenue of million in revenue the company experienced a million increase in revenue between years as a result of infospherix s state of pennsylvania campground reservation contract that was awarded to the company in and became operational at the beginning of direct contract and operating costs direct contract and operating costs increased  between years with the addition of the state of pennsylvania contract 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense s  g a for increased by  as the result of increased legal costs relating to the company s challenge of the us department of agriculture s award of the nrrs contract to another competitor  as noted above 
research and development research and development costs increased  between years 
the company is focusing its efforts on the development of naturlose as a treatment for type diabetes 
in  the company expended approximately  in preparation for the phase clinical trial which is expected to commence in april the phase clinical trial is expected to take at least two years to complete 
if the phase clinical trial is successful  the company will submit an appropriate drug application to the fda 
the cost of preparing for and conducting the phase trial has substantially increased as the company has increased the number of participants and the fda requested a change in the form of delivery of the drug to the participants 
the company estimates that it could expend up to million in in furtherance of this trial 
additional sums will be required to complete the trial in and  if successful  to file and pursue the fda application 
the company has also outsourced to others preliminary testing of naturlose to establish an anti plaque claim for toothpaste 
in  the company contracted with the university of maryland school of dentistry to conduct human clinical trials on the oral anti plaque efficacy of naturlose 
the study demonstrated tagatose to be much more resistant to oral bacteria  which form plaque  than is sorbitol  a sugar substitute that is widely used in oral care products 
the study suggested ways of modifying the naturlose product to effect desired plaque reduction 
such modifications have been made  and the company has negotiated with the university of maryland school of dentistry to conduct a trial of naturlose toothpaste formulated by the company in an attempt to establish an anti plaque claim for the toothpaste 
the clinical trial started in early other income in october  the company agreed to a million settlement to end its longstanding legal dispute with the us department of agriculture over the government s award of the national recreation reservation service nrrs contract to reserveamerica  a ticketmaster subsidiary 
the company s national park service contract ended january  the national park service contract contributed approximately million in revenue for each of the years ended december  and infospherix operations the following schedule summarizes the breakdown of infospherix revenue between government and commercial contracts in s for the year ended december government commercial as noted above  infospherix revenue for increased million over that of the prior year 
during  the company won a reservation contract from the state of maine  and the re compete of the contracts from the states of indiana and minnesota 
the company s national park service contract ended january  the company operated the nprs contract for nine years  revenue recognized was million for each of the years ended december   and  or and of total revenue for each year 
park reservation contracts during and made up over of the company s revenue and the company is one of only two major suppliers of campground reservation services in the us starting october   as part of the cost reduction efforts  the maryland information center contracts began operating exclusively in the company s cumberland office instead of the beltsville office  and its margins for the fourth quarter of and for all of are now consistent with our other contracts 
currently  the company is bidding on several contracts and expects to bid on more contracts throughout the coming year  although no assurance can be given at this time that these efforts will result in new business for the company 
biospherix operations biospherix is entitled to high end royalties from arla s sales of tagatose until at least  and  depending upon certain conditions  until the payments are net of accumulated and continuing foreign patent maintenance costs 
accumulated patent maintenance costs were approximately  at year end 
we have earned minimal royalties from arla in   and while tagatose has been introduced into several food and beverage products  arla currently has insufficient sales volume and manufacturing capacity to produce tagatose at the rate necessary to generate meaningful royalties 
at present  arla believes it has produced a sufficient backlog of inventory to satisfy its needs for the foreseeable future based on current demand  and accordingly has stopped production at its plant 
spherix is also pursing the possibility of other production options 
the company is focusing its efforts on the development of naturlose as a treatment for type diabetes 
in  the company expended approximately  in preparation for the phase clinical trial which is expected to commence in april the phase clinical trial is expected to take at least two years to complete 
if the phase clinical trial is successful  the company will submit a new drug application nda to the fda 
approval would allow the product to be sold for its intended use to treat type diabetes 
the company would seek to partner with or license a major drug firm for such commercialization 
the cost of preparing for and conducting the phase trial has substantially increased as the fda has provided more stringent parameters for the trial 
the company estimates that it could expend up to million in in furtherance of this trial 
additional sums will be required to complete the trial in and  if successful  to file and pursue the fda application 
the company has also outsourced to others preliminary testing of naturlose to establish an anti plaque claim for toothpaste 
sales backlog the company s funded and unfunded backlog as of december   was million  compared to million as of december  in  the company won a reservation contract from the state of maine  and the re compete of the contracts from the states of indiana and minnesota 
the nps contract ended in january results of operations compared with in  the company reported a net loss of million per diluted share on revenue of million for the year  compared with a net loss of million per diluted share on revenue of million in revenue revenue between years increased  
revenue from the infospherix division increased  and the biospherix division s revenue decreased by  
the increased revenue from the infospherix division was less than anticipated as a result of an unexpected temporary funding shortage on one of our major federal contracts that lasted for a period of four months until the federal government s fiscal year ended september  and from hurricanes and the rise in gasoline prices that impacted reservation sales on our park reservation contracts during the third quarter of the division also saw a decrease in revenue of approximately million between years as a result of the decrease in revenue under the new state of maryland contract that started november and the irs contract that ended in april however  these set backs were more than off set by the division s continued overall growth from the award of new contracts 
the revenue growth was primarily driven by contracts such as the federal retirement thrift investment board that started in may  the georgia contract that started in march  and from increases under existing contracts with the state of ohio and the office of personnel management 
the decrease in biospherix revenue was related to the discontinuance of the sale of flycracker in direct contract and operating costs direct contract and operating costs increased  between years 
this increase included the recognition of a forward loss provision of  on one of the company s contracts 
the increase is also attributed to approximately  in start up costs related to the new state of pennsylvania contract that began in january south dakota operations operated at a break even for  up  from selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense s  g a for decreased by  from that of the prior year 
in  the company cut its consulting costs by approximately  most of which were related to marketing 
research and development research and development costs increased  between years 
in  the biospherix division began a program of outsourcing development of its patented drug uses of naturlose 
a research project was funded at the albert einstein college of medicine to follow up on that institution s discovery that naturlose may lengthen shelf life of stored blood fractions and medicinal proteins 
in  the company contracted with the university of maryland school of dentistry to conduct human clinical trials on the oral anti plaque efficacy of naturlose 
the study demonstrated tagatose to be much more resistant to oral bacteria  which form plaque  than is sorbitol  a sugar substitute that is widely used in oral care products 
contrary to earlier laboratory findings by spherix  however  a human study at the university of maryland school of dentistry did not show anti plaque activity 
conditions in the mouth may have prevented the desired effect  according to the university researchers 
spherix is following up on corrective suggestions made by the university  and plans to conduct new human trials 
infospherix operations the following schedule summarizes the breakdown of infospherix revenue between government and commercial contracts in s for the year ended december government commercial as noted above  infospherix revenue for increased  over that of the prior year 
the increased revenue from the infospherix division was less than anticipated as a result of an unexpected temporary funding shortage on one of our major federal contracts that lasted for a period of four months until the federal government s fiscal year ended september  and from hurricanes and the rise in gasoline prices that impacted reservation sales on our park reservation contracts during the third quarter of the division also saw a decrease in revenue of approximately million between years from the decrease in revenue under the new state of maryland contract that started november  and the irs contract that ended in april however  these set backs were more than off set by the division s continued overall growth 
this revenue growth was primarily driven by contracts such as the federal retirement thrift investment board that started in may  georgia that started in march  and from increases under existing contracts such as ohio and the office of personnel management 
the fourth quarter in particular saw a significant improvement over the prior year  with an increase in revenue of  as a result of increased revenue in the federal retirement thrift investment board contract and a general growth across the board on our existing reservation contracts 
this combined with a reduction in direct costs of  between the fourth quarter of and  contributed to the  improvement in operations between quarters 
in  spherix won park reservation contracts for orange county  california  the state of pennsylvania  and the state of michigan 
the orange county contract consists of three base years and is valued at less than half a million 
the state of pennsylvania contract is a five year contract  consisting of one base year and four option years  valued at approximately million 
the state of michigan contract is a continuation of our current contract with the state 
the new contract is for five years  and consists of three base years plus two option years  valued at approximately million 
in march  the company won a one year  multi million dollar federal retirement thrift investment board frtib contract with four option years 
also  on march   the company purchased certain assets of daksoft  inc related to its reservation business  which operates under the name reserveit 
the purchase included the acquisition of six additional government reservation contracts and the intellectual property rights to the name reserveit  as well as other assets of the division 
spherix purchased the assets for  plus  shares of the company s common stock  then trading at per share 
in  the company won the re procurement of the maryland information center contracts  which the company has operated since the new contracts are for three years plus two additional option years 
the combined maryland contracts contributed to the company s revenue in and in the new contract started on november   and is subject to a more competitive pricing structure  which was necessary to win the re compete 
while spherix was not the lowest bidder  the company s higher technical scoring resulted in the company achieving an overall higher score than the competition 
management is uncertain as to the long term financial impact the price reduction will have over the course of the contract and believes that the lower rates may encourage the state to outsource more of its call center needs to spherix under this contract 
the previous contract initially operated at a loss during its first year and had matured to a respectable contribution margin by the time the contract ended in late this increase was gained through the continued outsourcing of more of the state s call center needs to spherix under the contract 
the new contract  which was bid at a lower contribution margin  is the principal cause for the decrease in operating income between years 
starting october   as part of the cost reduction efforts  the maryland contract began operating exclusively out of the company s cumberland office instead of the beltsville office  and its margins for the fourth quarter were now consistent with our other contracts 
revenue from commercial contracts decreased between years 
commercial contracts are typically for shorter terms than government contracts and that can result in substantial variations in commercial revenue 
commercial contracts are being pursued by the company  but the company s recent history has been that contracts have been received on a sporadic basis 
biospherix operations the  decrease in the biospherix revenue from  to  between years was related to the discontinuance of the sale of flycracker in sales backlog the company s funded and unfunded backlog as of december   was million  compared to million as of december  in  the company won five year contracts with the states of pennsylvania and michigan 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses for the period reported 
estimates are based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates are evaluated periodically and form the basis for making judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
spherix s critical accounting policies are those it believes are the most important in determining its financial condition and results  and require significant subjective judgment by management as a result of inherent uncertainties 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is set out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
such policies are discussed below 
accounting for taxes and valuation allowances we currently have significant deferred tax assets  resulting from net operating loss carry forwards 
these deferred tax assets may reduce taxable income in future periods 
based on the company s losses and its accumulated deficit  the company has provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment of valuation allowances 
we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained  or we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable 
long lived assets and other intangible assets long lived assets and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset s use and eventual disposition 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
the interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we are required to adopt fin effective january  we are currently evaluating the impact this interpretation will have on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we are required to adopt sfas effective january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material affect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the us securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab addresses diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements and the potential under current practice for the build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet 
the bulletin requires companies to quantify misstatements based on their impact on each of their financial statements and related disclosures 
we have adopted sab in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended december  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources on march   the company entered into a new agreement with bank of america the bank to establish a line of credit new agreement for its subsidiary  infospherix incorporated  with the outstanding borrowings under the old line of credit transferred to the new agreement 
management considers the establishment of this credit facility for the subsidiary necessary to ensure timely cash flow for the subsidiary s operations 
the new agreement  which matures june   provides for borrowings up to million  is collateralized by the subsidiary s accounts receivables and equipment  and contains covenants on tangible net worth and funded debt to ebitda ratios 
such covenants could have a limiting effect on the amount of cash that the subsidiary can advance to spherix 
the interest rate under the agreement is based on the libor daily floating rate plus approximately at december  
the company had no outstanding borrowings under the agreement at december   and the total amount available for future advance to the subsidiary was million under the agreement 
working capital as of december   was million  which represents a million increase from working capital of million at december  the increase in working capital between years was largely related to the us department of agriculture settlement 
spherix expects to expend up to million over the next year in costs related to the phase clinical trial 
infospherix incorporated intends to finance its furniture and equipment needs through financing or leasing arrangements where practicable  including those related to the start up costs of new contracts the company may win 
cash flow for the year ended december   reflects a net cash inflow of million  consisting of million provided by operating activities   provided by investing activities  and million provided by financing activities 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in from that of the prior year was primarily due to million settlement with the us department of agriculture over the award of the nrrs contract 
the increase in cash provided by investing activities was directly related to the expiration of restrictions on cash that was used as collateral on the company s line of credit in prior years  and the increase in cash provided by financing activities was the result of proceeds raised from the issuance of stock under the seda agreement and the exercise of warrants 
trends and outlooks infospherix the company s national park service contract ended january  the national park service contract contributed approximately million in revenue for each of the years ended december  and in  the company won the re compete on its park reservation services to the states of indiana and minnesota and recently won a new state park reservation contract for the state of maine and will be a subcontractor on another contract 
since  infospherix has grown its government park reservation business from one contract to government reservation contracts 
infospherix s reservation business accounted for over of the company s revenue in and infospherix is now one of only two major suppliers of government campground reservation services in the us on february   the company signed an agreement to lease  square feet of facility space in frostburg  maryland effective december   for use as a call center to replace the existing cumberland  maryland facility 
biospherix biospherix s primary emphasis is on a phase clinical trial to demonstrate that naturlose is a successful treatment for type diabetes 
costs of conducting the phase trial have substantially increased as we have obtained further direction from the fda concerning the processes to be employed in the trials 
the company is exploring all of its alternatives to generate sufficient funds to complete the phase trial  to further develop naturlose as a diabetes treatment if the phase trial is successful  and to further commercialize naturlose for other uses 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s known contractual obligations at december   and indicates the year payments are due 
in some cases estimates have been used where the exact amount and or timing of the obligation is not presently known 
the table does not include ordinary accounts payable and payroll type obligations and does not include estimates for future interest obligation payments under the company s bank line of credit noted above in the liquidity and capital resources sections 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations numbers in s total thereafter capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations post retirement obligations total includes interest obligations of   in and  in 
includes estimated common area maintenance costs 
consists primarily of the estimated amounts on the committed obligations related to the phase clinical trial 
no dividends were paid in and none are anticipated in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manages its debt and its available cash by considering available investment opportunities  risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
at december   the company did not have any fixed rate or variable rate indebtedness 
the company has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivatives with respect to its indebtedness 
cash available for investment is typically invested in short term funds  which generally mature in days  or money market funds 
in general  such funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the carrying amounts approximate market value 
it is the company s practice to hold these investments to maturity 
assuming year end variable rate debt and cash available for investment  a one percent change in interest rates would impact net interest income by less than
