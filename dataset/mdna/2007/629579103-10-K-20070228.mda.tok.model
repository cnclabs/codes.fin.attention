table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s subsidiaries  nmhg  hb ps  kci and nacoal  have entered into certain financing arrangements that require interest payments based on floating interest rates 
as such  the company s financial results are subject to changes in the market rate of interest 
to reduce the exposure to changes in the market rate of interest  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements for a significant portion of its floating rate financing arrangements 
the company does not enter into interest rate swap agreements for trading purposes 
terms of the interest rate swap agreements require the subsidiaries to receive a variable interest rate and pay a fixed interest rate 
see also note and note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
in addition  nacoal has fixed rate debt arrangements 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  the company uses sensitivity analysis to measure the potential loss in fair value of financial instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the company assumes that a loss in fair value is an increase to its liabilities 
nacoal s fixed rate private placement notes have a fair value based on company estimates of million at december  assuming a hypothetical decrease in the effective interest yield on this fixed rate debt  the fair value of this liability would increase by million compared with the fair value of this liability at december  nacoal also has three collateralized notes payable related to the purchase of mining equipment with a fair value of million 
assuming a hypothetical decrease in the effective interest yield on this fixed rate debt  the fair value of this liability would increase by less than million compared with the book and fair value of this liability at december  the fair value of the company s interest rate swap agreements was an asset of million at december  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would cause a decrease in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements and the resulting fair value would be a liability of million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk nmhg and hb ps operate internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
as such  their financial results are subject to the variability that arises from exchange rate movements 
nmhg and hb ps use forward foreign currency exchange contracts to partially reduce risks related to transactions denominated in foreign currencies and not for trading purposes 
these contracts generally mature within one year and require the companies to buy or sell japanese yen  australian dollars  canadian dollars  mexican pesos  swedish kroner  british pound sterling or euros for the functional currency in which the applicable subsidiary operates at rates agreed to at the inception of the contracts 
the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of million at december  see also notes and to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  the company uses sensitivity analysis to measure the potential loss in fair value of financial instruments sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company assumes that a loss in fair value is either a decrease to its assets or an increase to its liabilities 
assuming a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar compared with other foreign currencies at december   the fair value of foreign currency sensitive financial instruments  which primarily represents forward foreign currency exchange contracts  would decline by million compared with its fair value at december  it is important to note that the loss in fair value indicated in this sensitivity analysis would be somewhat offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying receivables  payables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
commodity price risk the company uses certain commodities  including steel  resins  linerboard and diesel fuel  in the normal course of its manufacturing  distribution and mining processes 
as such  the cost of operations is subject to variability as the market for these commodities changes 
the company monitors this risk and  from time to time  enters into derivative contracts to hedge this risk 
the company does not currently have any such derivative contracts outstanding  nor does the company have any significant purchase obligations to obtain fixed quantities of commodities in the future
