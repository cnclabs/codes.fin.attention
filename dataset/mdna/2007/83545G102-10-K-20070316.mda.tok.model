item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the sonic automotive  inc and subsidiaries consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the financial and statistical data contained in the following discussion for all periods presented reflects our december  classification of franchises between continuing and discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 

table of contents overview we are one of the largest automotive retailers in the united states 
as of march  we operated dealership franchises  representing different brands of cars and light trucks  at locations and collision repair centers in states 
our dealerships provide comprehensive services including sales of both new and used cars and light trucks  sales of replacement parts  performance of vehicle maintenance  manufacturer warranty repairs  paint and collision repair services  and arrangement of extended service contracts  financing  insurance and other aftermarket products for our customers 
although vehicle sales are cyclical and are affected by many factors  including general economic conditions  consumer confidence  levels of discretionary personal income  interest rates and available credit  our parts  service and collision repair services are not closely tied to vehicle sales and are not as dependent upon near term sales volume 
as a result  we believe the diversity of these products and services reduces the risk of periodic economic downturns 
the automobile industry s total amount of new vehicles sold decreased by to million vehicles in from million vehicles in from an industry perspective  new vehicle unit sales on a year over year basis grew for import brands and contracted for domestic brands 
many factors such as brand and geographic concentrations have caused our past results to differ from the industry s overall trend 
in  both our import and domestic stores outperformed the overall new vehicle industry s year over year unit sales change 
we sell similar products and services that exhibit similar economic characteristics  use similar processes in selling our products and services and sell our products and services to similar classes of customers 
as a result of this and the way we manage our business  we have aggregated our operating segments into a single segment for purposes of reporting financial condition and results of operations 
in the ordinary course of business we evaluate our dealership franchises for possible disposition based on various performance criteria 
during the year ended december   we sold franchises and had approved  but not completed  the disposition of additional franchises 
these franchises have been identified as held for sale because of unprofitable operations or other strategic considerations 
we believe the disposition of these franchises will allow us to focus our management attention on those remaining stores with the highest potential return on investment 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the most subjective and complex judgments 
the following is a discussion of what we believe are our critical accounting policies and estimates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our accounting policies 
finance  insurance and service contracts we arrange financing for customers through various financial institutions and receive a commission from the lender either in a flat fee amount or in an amount equal to the difference between the actual interest rates charged to customers and the predetermined base rates set by the financing institution 
we also receive commissions from the sale of various insurance contracts and non recourse third party extended service contracts to customers 
under these contracts  the applicable manufacturer or third party warranty company is directly liable for all warranties provided within the contract 
in the event a customer terminates a financing  insurance or extended service contract prior to the original termination date  we may be required to return a portion of the commission revenue originally recorded to the third party provider chargebacks 
the commission revenue for the sale of these products and services is 
table of contents recorded net of estimated chargebacks at the time of sale 
our estimate of future chargebacks is established based on our historical chargeback rates  termination provisions of the applicable contracts and industry data 
while chargeback rates vary depending on the type of contract sold  a basis point change in the estimated chargeback rates used in determining our estimates of future chargebacks would have changed our estimated reserve for chargebacks at december  by approximately million 
our estimate of chargebacks million as of december  is influenced by early contract termination events such as vehicle repossessions  refinancings and early pay off 
if these factors change  the resulting impact is a change in our estimate for chargebacks 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment might have occurred 
based on criteria established by the applicable accounting pronouncements  we allocate the carrying value of goodwill and test it for impairment based on our three geographic divisions 
the  million of goodwill on our balance sheet  including approximately million classified in assets held for sale  at december  was allocated to the following geographic divisions dollars in millions eastern division central division western division in evaluating goodwill for impairment  if the fair value of a division is less than the carrying value of that division  we are then required to proceed to the second step of the impairment test 
the second step involves allocating the calculated fair value to all of the assets of the respective division as if the calculated fair value was the purchase price of the business combination 
this allocation would include assigning value to any previously unrecognized identifiable assets including franchise assets which means the remaining fair value that would be allocated to goodwill would be significantly reduced 
see discussion regarding franchise agreements acquired prior to july  in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we would then compare the fair value of the goodwill resulting from this allocation process to the carrying value of the goodwill in the respective division with the difference representing the amount of impairment 
we use several assumptions and various fair value approaches in evaluating our goodwill for impairment 
these assumptions and approaches include various earnings multiple approaches along with a discounted cash flow model utilizing estimated future earnings and our weighted average cost of capital 
at december   we were not required to conduct the second step of the impairment test described above  and we recognized no impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill on our balance sheet at december  however  if in future periods we determine that the fair value of one or more of our divisions is less than their carrying value  we believe that application of the second step of the impairment test would result in a substantial impairment charge to the goodwill allocated to such division s and the amount of such impairment charge would likely be materially adverse to our consolidated operating results and financial position 
insurance reserves we have various self insured and high deductible insurance programs which require us to make estimates in determining the ultimate liability we may incur for claims arising under these programs 
we accrue for insurance reserves on a pro rata basis throughout the year based on the expected year end liability 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made quarterly by our management based on available information and take into consideration annual actuarial evaluations based on historical claims experience  claims processing procedures  medical cost trends and  in certain cases  a discount factor 
if our management receives information which causes us to change our estimate of the year end liability  the amount of expense or expense reduction required to be recorded in any particular quarter could be material to our operating results  financial position and cash flows 
we estimate the ultimate liability under these programs is between million and million 
at december   we had million reserved for such programs 
we used a discount rate 
table of contents of to calculate the present value of our estimated workers compensation claims 
a discount rate of was used to calculate the present value of our general liability claim reserves 
a bps change in the discount rate or a basis point change in the selected loss cost estimate would not have a significant impact on the reserve balance 
lease exit accruals the majority of our dealership properties are leased under long term operating lease arrangements 
when leased properties are no longer utilized in operations  we record lease exit accruals 
these situations could include the relocation of an existing facility or the sale of a franchise where the buyer will not be subleasing the property for either the remaining term of the lease or for an amount equal to our obligation under the lease 
the lease exit accruals represent the present value of the lease payments  net of estimated sublease rentals  for the remaining life of the operating leases and other accruals necessary to satisfy the lease commitment to the landlord 
at december   we had million accrued for lease exit costs 
legal proceedings we are involved  and expect to continue to be involved  in numerous legal proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business  including litigation with customers  employment related lawsuits  contractual disputes and actions brought by governmental authorities 
as of december   we had million in legal reserves included in other accrued liabilities 
currently  with the exception of the galura litigation matter discussed in item legal proceedings herein  no legal proceedings are pending against or involve us that  in the opinion of management  could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and prospects 
classification of franchises in continuing and discontinued operations we classify the results from operations of our continuing and discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income based on the provisions of sfas no 
many of these provisions involve judgment in determining whether a franchise will be reported as continuing or discontinued operations 
such judgments include whether a franchise will be sold or terminated  the period required to complete the disposition and the likelihood of changes to a plan for sale 
if in future periods we determine that a franchise should be either reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations or from discontinued operations to continuing operations  previously reported consolidated statements of income may be reclassified in order to reflect the current classification 
income taxes as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and from time to time  these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes 
we believe that our tax positions comply  in all material respects  with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
included in other accrued liabilities at december  is million in reserves that we have provided for these matters 
we have million in deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards that will expire between and management reviews these carryforward positions  the time remaining until expiration and other opportunities to utilize these carryforwards in making an assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that these carryforwards will be utilized 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million in based on our judgment that certain state carryforwards will not be utilized 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance related to our remaining carryforwards because it is more likely than not that taxable income for these other states will be sufficient to realize the benefits of the associated deferred tax assets 
however  the results of future operations  regulatory framework of these taxing authorities and other related matters cannot be predicted with certainty 
therefore  actual utilization of the losses which created these deferred tax assets which differs from the assumptions used in the development of our judgment could result in a charge that would be materially adverse to our consolidated operating results  financial position and cash flows 
we accrue for income taxes on a pro rata basis throughout the year based on the expected year end liability 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made quarterly by our management based on available 
table of contents information and take into consideration estimated income taxes based on prior year income tax returns  changes in income tax law  our income tax strategies and other factors 
if our management receives information which causes us to change our estimate of the year end liability  the amount of expense or expense reduction required to be recorded in any particular quarter could be material to our operating results  financial position and cash flows 
cornerstone acceptance allowance for credit losses as of december   we had outstanding notes receivable arising from operations of our wholly owned finance subsidiary  cornerstone acceptance corporation cornerstone  of million  net of an allowance for credit losses of million 
these notes receivable have average terms of approximately forty three months and are secured by the related vehicles 
our assessment of allowance for credit losses considers historical loss ratios  the performance of the current portfolio with respect to past due accounts  and the average age of the accounts in the current portfolio 
as of december   the average loss ratio for mature accounts was and the average percentage of losses remaining to be incurred on the current portfolio as a result of the average age of the current portfolio was 
a change of basis points in both of these percentages would have changed our estimated allowance for credit losses by million at december  these notes receivable are recorded in receivables  net  and other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
sonic s management is currently evaluating strategic alternatives for cornerstone 
these alternatives include selling cornerstone or selling all or a portion of cornerstone s outstanding notes receivable 
recent accounting pronouncement on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
tax benefits associated with share based payments will be recognized as an addition to paid in capital 
cash retained as a result of these tax benefits will be presented in the statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows and operating cash outflows 
on december   a committee of our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of all outstanding options to purchase our class a common stock with an exercise price of more than per share 
the purpose of the accelerated vesting of these stock options was to reduce the non cash compensation expense we would have recorded in future periods pursuant to sfas no 
r 
this accelerated vesting reduced future expense pursuant to sfas no 
r by approximately million 
we recognized approximately million of expense related to stock options during the year ended december  see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion and disclosures 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin no

see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements  business acquisitions and dispositions  which discusses these and other factors that affect the comparability of the information for the periods presented 
the cost of sales line item includes the cost of new and used vehicles  vehicle parts and all costs directly linked to servicing customer vehicles 
during the year ended december   we sold franchises  and had approved  but not completed  the disposition of additional franchises 
the results of operations of these dealerships  including gains or losses on disposition  have been included in discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
in addition to these dispositions  during the years ended december  and  we disposed or terminated seven and franchises  respectively 
annual same store results of operations represent the aggregate of the same store results for each of the four quarters in that year 
same store results for each quarter include dealerships that were owned and operated for the entire quarter in both periods and were classified as continuing operations under sfas no 
at december  unless otherwise noted  our discussion of the results of operations from new vehicles to gross profit and gross margins is on a same store basis 
new vehicles new vehicle revenues include the sale and lease of new vehicles  as well as the sale of fleet vehicles 
new vehicle revenues are highly dependent on manufacturer incentives  which vary from cash back incentives to low 
table of contents interest rate financing 
new vehicle revenues are also dependent on manufacturers for adequate vehicle allocations to meet customer demands 
the automobile manufacturing industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
as an automotive retailer  we seek to mitigate the effects of this cyclicality by maintaining a diverse mix of domestic and import branded dealerships 
our brand diversity allows us to offer a broad range of products at a wide range of prices from lower priced  or economy vehicles  to luxury vehicles 
we believe that this diversity reduces the risk of changes in customer preferences  product supply shortages and aging products 
for the year ended december   of our total new vehicle revenue was generated by import and luxury dealerships compared to for we expect this trend toward more import and domestic luxury dealerships to continue 
we believe demographic and other trends favor import and luxury brands and expect our acquisition activity in the future to concentrate primarily  but not completely  on these brands 
for the year ended units or change change for the year ended units or change change total new vehicle units same store acquisitions and other total as reported total new vehicle revenues in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported total new vehicle unit price same store total dealerships as reported the increase in our same store new vehicle unit sales was driven entirely by our import dealerships  which experienced an increase of  units  or  while our domestic dealerships experienced a decrease of units  or 
our import stores underperformed the industry unit volume increase of  while our domestic stores outperformed the industry decrease of 
our top performing import brands for were toyota and mercedes  which posted increases of  units  or  and units  or  respectively 
these increases can be attributed to the introduction of new models  in addition to new body styling and design on existing models 
additionally  our bmw stores posted a revenue increase despite a slight decline in unit volume 
our honda dealerships experienced the most significant decline in sales volume among our import stores  decreasing by units  or  as compared to our top performing domestic brand was ford  which posted an increase of units  or 
our gm excluding cadillac dealerships experienced a decline in new retail unit volume of  units  or  but strong fleet sales with an increase of units  or  helped to offset that decline 
additionally  our cadillac stores posted an improvement in fleet sales of units  or  which offset the domestic decline in new unit volume 
the increase in our sales price per unit can be attributed mainly to the fact that a larger percentage of our sales are being generated by higher priced luxury vehicles 
many of our import dealerships experienced price per unit increases  most notably being mercedes  bmw and honda up  and  respectively 
on the domestic side  our ford and cadillac dealerships experienced the most significant increases in sales price per unit up and  respectively 
the increases at these dealerships can be attributed to both the various pricing strategies put in place by ford and gm during  which lowered pricing  and a shift from car sales to truck and suv sales during the current year 
during  both our import and domestic dealerships experienced increases in total same store new vehicle unit sales  as compared to our import dealerships experienced an increase of  units  or 
table of contents during this time period 
this is compared to an industry increase in unit sales at import dealerships of 
this increase can be mainly attributed to our honda and toyota dealerships  which experienced unit volume increases of and  respectively  when compared to management stability at our honda dealerships contributed to the improvement in new vehicle sales volume 
our domestic dealerships experienced a unit sales increase of  units  or  during this is compared to an industry decrease in unit sales at domestic dealerships of 
our gm excluding cadillac and ford dealerships experienced declines in new retail unit volume  but strong fleet sales led to an overall improvement in total new unit sales volume 
the declines experienced at our domestic dealerships in can be mainly attributed to declining truck and suv sales  which resulted from significant increases in gas prices 
conversely  our cadillac stores managed only a small increase in new retail unit volume  while a decline in fleet sales led to an overall decline in new unit volume 
all of our import dealerships except volvo  acura and vw experienced sales price per unit increases during our honda dealerships experienced the most significant improvement in sales price per unit  increasing by  or  when compared to all of our domestic dealerships experienced price per unit decreases 
used vehicles used vehicle revenues are directly affected by the level of manufacturer incentives on new vehicles  the number and quality of trade ins and lease turn ins and the availability of consumer credit 
in addition  various manufacturers provide franchised dealers the opportunity to certify pre owned vehicles based on criteria established by the manufacturer 
this certification process extends the standard manufacturer warranty 
on a continuing operations basis  our sales of cpo vehicles decreased in to of total used vehicle units from in  a decrease of 
this decrease was partially due to the increase in non cpo vehicles related to the implementation of a standardized merchandising process  that includes the retailing of value used vehicles  along with an inventory management system at a number of our stores 
we expect to continue the rollout and refinement of the process in additionally  industry pricing improvements affected the value of used vehicles  as the manheim used vehicle value index increased by from december to december for the year ended units or change change for the year ended units or change change total used vehicle units same store acquisitions and other total as reported total used vehicle revenues in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported total used vehicle unit price same store total dealerships as reported in  our import dealerships contributed to the overall improvement in used unit volume by posting an increase of  units  or  when compared to of our import stores  bmw  honda and toyota posted the most significant increases in used unit volume 
our domestic dealerships also posted an improvement in used unit sales volume  increasing by units  or 
cadillac was the largest contributor to the domestic increase in unit volume 
our overall price per unit increase of is due mainly to a favorable used vehicle market 
based on the improvement in the manheim used vehicle value index as stated above  we believe that our price per unit increase is consistent with the industry as a whole 

table of contents during  the increase in used unit sales volume was driven entirely by our import dealerships  which posted an increase of  units  or  when compared to of our import stores  honda and bmw posted the most significant increases in used unit volume 
our ford and gm excluding cadillac stores posted the only increases in used unit volume among our domestic brands 
our cadillac dealerships experienced the largest decline in unit volume among all of our brands 
wholesale vehicles wholesale vehicle revenues are highly correlated with new and used vehicle retail sales and the associated trade in volume 
wholesale revenues are also significantly affected by our corporate inventory management policies  which are designed to optimize our total used vehicle inventory 
for the year ended units or change change for the year ended units or change change total wholesale vehicle units same store acquisitions and other total as reported total wholesale vehicle revenues in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported total wholesale unit price same store total dealerships as reported the decline in wholesale unit volume can be mainly attributed to the implementation of our merchandising and inventory management process see used vehicles above for further discussion 
we believe this improved process allowed us to retail used vehicles we historically would have disposed of through the wholesale market 
during  higher revenues realized were driven by both an increase in wholesale unit sales volume and higher unit sales prices at our import dealerships 
unit sales volume at our import dealerships increased by  units  or  while price per unit increased by  or 
favorable pricing increases followed the increases experienced in used retail sales and were consistent with the industry 
additionally  our domestic dealerships experienced only a slight increase in unit volume 
improvements in retail vehicle sales volume  the principal source of wholesale vehicle revenues via trade in  contributed to the higher overall volume in  as compared to parts  service and collision repair fixed operations same store revenue from these items was as follows amounts in thousands for the year ended change change for the year ended change change parts service collision repair parts and service revenue consists of customer requested repairs customer pay  warranty repairs  retail parts  wholesale parts and collision repairs 
parts and service revenue is driven by the mix of warranty repairs versus customer pay repairs  available service capacity  vehicle quality  customer loyalty and manufacturer 
table of contents warranty programs 
during  of our service and parts revenue was generated by warranty repairs and by customer pay repairs compared to by warranty repairs and by customer pay repairs in we believe that over time  vehicle quality will improve  but vehicle complexity will offset any revenue lost from improvement in vehicle quality 
we also believe that we have the ability  through our access to capital  to continue to add service capacity and increase revenues 
during  we added service stalls  or  to our overall stall capacity in addition  manufacturers continue to extend new vehicle warranty periods and have also begun to include regular maintenance items in the warranty coverage 
these factors  combined with the extended manufacturer warranties on cpo vehicles see the discussion in business business strategy certified pre owned vehicles above  should facilitate continued growth in our service and parts business 
parts revenue is driven by the mix of warranty repairs versus customer pay repairs as prices for warranty parts are established by the manufacturer 
we believe that long term trends in retail parts sales will be affected by the same trends as discussed above for service additional capacity  customer satisfaction  etc as of december   we operated collision repair centers 
collision revenues are heavily impacted by trends in the automotive insurance industry 
over the last few years  collision repair revenues have either declined or remained flat because customers are choosing higher deductible policies  thus choosing not to make minor repairs that were previously covered by lower deductible policies 
in addition  when insurance companies declare a vehicle totaled  the model year of that vehicle often determines where it is repaired 
late model vehicles tend to be repaired at franchised dealership body shops  while older vehicles tend to be repaired at stand alone collision centers 
for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total parts  service and collision repair in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported same store fixed operations revenues increased during  primarily due to the performance of our import dealerships up million  or outpacing decreases in our domestic dealerships down million  or 
customer pay sales at our import dealerships increased million  or 
our bmw dealerships experienced significant increases in fixed operations revenues  increasing by million  or  compared to as a continued result of bmw s vehicle maintenance programs and strong same store new vehicle sales 
these import increases were partially offset by decreases of million  or  at our domestic dealerships 
warranty sales declines of million  or  were offset by an increase in customer pay of million  or  at our domestic stores 
our gm and cadillac dealerships  which decreased million  or  and million  or  respectively  as compared to contributed to lower domestic sales 
the declines in our gm dealerships were primarily caused by a decrease in warranty repair services and wholesale parts sales of million  or

our bmw dealerships experienced significant increases in fixed operations revenues  increasing by million  or  compared to as a continued result of bmw s vehicle maintenance programs and strong same store new vehicle sales 
in addition  our bmw stores posted increases in warranty sales of million  or 
these import increases were partially offset by decreases in warranty sales at our domestic 
table of contents dealerships  which declined million  or  compared to the overall domestic dealership fixed operations revenue declines primarily relate to our cadillac dealerships  which decreased million  or as compared to warranty sales at our cadillac stores experienced declines of million  or  as compared to finance  insurance and other finance  insurance and other revenues include commissions for arranging vehicle financing and insurance  sales of third party extended service contracts for vehicles and other aftermarket products 
in connection with vehicle financing  service contracts  other aftermarket products and insurance contracts  we receive a commission from the provider for originating the contract 
rate spread is another term for the commission earned by our dealerships for arranging vehicle financing for consumers 
the amount of the commission could be zero  a flat fee or an actual spread between the interest rate charged to the consumer and the interest rate provided by the direct financing source bank  credit union or manufacturers captive finance company 
we have established caps on the potential rate spread our dealerships can earn with all finance sources 
we believe the rate spread we earn for arranging financing represents value to the consumer in numerous ways  including the following lower cost  sub vented financing is often available only from the manufacturers captives and franchised dealers  lease financing alternatives are largely available only from manufacturers captives or other indirect lenders  customers with substandard credit frequently do not have direct access to potential sources of sub prime financing  and customers with significant negative equity in their current vehicle ie  the customer s current vehicle is worth less than the balance of their vehicle loan or lease obligation frequently are unable to pay off the loan on their current vehicle and finance the purchase or lease of a replacement new or used vehicle without the assistance of a franchised dealer 
finance  insurance and other revenues are driven by the level of new and used vehicle sales  manufacturer financing or leasing incentives and our penetration rate 
the penetration rate represents the percentage of vehicle sales on which we are able to originate financing or sell extended service contracts  other aftermarket products or insurance contracts 
our finance penetration rate decreased slightly to in from in our extended service contract penetration rate increased to in from in we expect our finance and insurance penetration rate to increase over time as we continue to emphasize the use of menu selling techniques

our domestic stores also experienced a slight increase in revenues of million  or 
the increase was led by our cadillac and gm stores of million  or  and million  or  respectively 
the revenue increase was partially offset by a million increase in our allowance for estimated finance chargebacks that was recorded in the second quarter ended june  as a result of a change in estimate for the allowance

the increase at our import stores was slightly offset by a decrease of million or at our domestic stores  due to a decline in new and used retail units sold of and  respectively 
the domestic decline was partially offset by our gm stores excluding cadillac  which experienced increases of million  or 
gross profit and gross margins the cost of sales line item includes the cost of new and used vehicles  vehicle parts and all costs directly linked to servicing customer vehicles labor for parts  service and collision repair associates  depreciation on service equipment and service consumables 
our overall gross profit and gross margin gross profit as a percentage of revenues as a percentage of revenues generally vary depending on changes in our revenue mix 
although sales of new vehicles comprise the majority of our total revenues  new vehicles generally carry the lowest margin rate of any product or service we offer 
as a result  sales of new vehicles comprise a relatively small portion of total gross profits when compared to revenue 
retail sales of used vehicles generally carry a slightly higher gross margin rate than new vehicles 
parts  service and collision repair carry a much higher gross margin rate than vehicle sales 
product mix also has an impact on the gross margins that we realize 
historically  our import and luxury brands provide higher margins than our domestic brands 
as we continue to acquire more import and luxury dealerships  we would expect our gross margins to increase 
our same store revenue mix between different products is shown in the following table for the year ended basis point change for the year ended basis point change revenues as a percentage of total revenues new vehicles used vehicles wholesale vehicles fixed operations finance  insurance and other total as reported for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total gross profit in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported 
table of contents the overall gross margin rates on our various revenue lines on a same store basis were as follows for the year ended basis point change for the year ended basis point change new vehicles used vehicles wholesale vehicles parts  service and collision repair finance and insurance overall gross margin our same store gross margin percentage was flat in  when compared to gross margin improvements experienced in fixed operations were offset by declines in both the used and wholesale vehicle gross margin percentages 
our toyota dealerships posted the most significant increase in fixed operations gross margin percentage among our import dealerships  improving by basis points 
in addition  the majority of our domestic dealerships contributed to the fixed operations increase 
specifically  our gm excluding cadillac  ford and cadillac dealerships experienced fixed operations margin increases of basis points  basis points and basis points  respectively  when compared to the overall same store gross margin percentage remained flat at in and improvements experienced in all other categories were offset by a basis point decline in the new vehicle gross margin percentage 
the largest increases in margin percentage related to used and wholesale vehicles  which were primarily attributed to price increases driven by a lower supply of higher quality used vehicles than in previous years 
fixed operations gross margin percentages improved primarily due to a basis point increase experienced at our ford dealerships 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are comprised of four major groups compensation expense  advertising expense  rent and rent related expense  and other expense 
compensation expense primarily relates to dealership personnel who are paid a commission or a modest salary plus commission which typically vary depending on gross profits realized and support personnel who are paid a fixed salary 
due to the salary component for certain dealership and corporate personnel  gross profits and compensation expense are not correlated 
advertising expense and other expenses vary based on the level of actual or anticipated business activity and number of dealerships owned 
rent and rent related expense typically varies with the number of dealerships owned  investments made for facility improvements and interest rates

liquidity and capital resources we require cash to finance acquisitions and fund debt service and working capital requirements 
we rely on cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and offerings of debt and equity securities to meet these requirements 
because the majority of our consolidated assets are held by our dealership subsidiaries  the majority of our cash flows from operations are generated by these subsidiaries 
as a result  our cash flows and ability to service debt depends to a substantial degree on the results of operations of these subsidiaries and their ability to provide us with cash based on their ability to generate cash

we anticipate that proceeds from either type of sale will be used to reduce our leverage 
our consolidated statement of cash flows includes both continuing and discontinued operations 
net cash used in operating activities associated with discontinued operations was approximately million and was substantially comprised of an adjustment for depreciation  gains on the disposal of franchises and property and equipment and changes in assets and liabilities that relate to dealership operations

table of contents we believe our best source of liquidity for future growth remains cash flows generated from operations combined with our availability of borrowings under our floor plan facilities or any replacements thereof  our revolving credit facility and our ability to raise funds in the public capital markets 
though uncertainties in the economic environment as well as uncertainties associated with geopolitical conflicts may affect our ability to generate cash from operations  we expect to generate more than sufficient cash flow to fund our debt service and working capital requirements and any seasonal operating requirements  including our currently anticipated internal growth for our existing businesses  for the foreseeable future 
once these needs are met  we may use remaining cash flow to support our acquisition strategy or repurchase shares of our class a common stock or publicly traded debt securities  as market conditions warrant 
seasonality our operations are subject to seasonal variations 
the first and fourth quarters generally contribute less revenue and operating profits than the second and third quarters 
weather conditions  the timing of manufacturer incentive programs and model changeovers cause seasonality in  and may adversely affect our profitability and new vehicle demand
