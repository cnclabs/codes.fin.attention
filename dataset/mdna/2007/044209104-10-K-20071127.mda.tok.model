the results reflect nine months of equity income from ashland s ownership interest in map through june   when ashland transferred its interest in map to marathon as described in note c of notes to consolidated financial statements 
an analysis of operating income by industry segment follows 
during  ashland redefined its reporting segments as it continues to evolve into a diversified  global chemical company 
performance materials and water technologies  formerly combined under ashland specialty chemical  have now been separately disclosed because these businesses serve different markets and recent acquisitions have made water technologies a much larger and more distinct part of ashland 
segment operating results reflect new methodology adopted in october for allocating substantially all corporate expenses to ashland s operating businesses  with the exception of certain legacy costs or items clearly not associated with the operating divisions 
additional corporate expenses allocated to ashland s four operating divisions under this new methodology amounted to million in  million in and million in however  the sale of apac in august and the reclassification of apac s results as discontinued operations impacted this methodology change 
under generally accepted accounting principles  allocations of general corporate overhead may not be allocated to discontinued operations for financial statement presentation 
as a result  the unallocated and other component of operating income primarily represents corporate overhead previously allocated to apac 
results for have been reclassified to conform to the new allocation methodology 
performance materials performance materials reported operating income of million for  a decrease compared to the record million for the gross profit margin decreased to from in  resulting in an million decrease in operating income 
sales and operating revenues increased  from  million for to  million for  primarily due to price increases  as pounds per shipping day were flat for both periods at million pounds 
on a comparable twelve month period  when adjusted for the acquisitions of northwest coatings and the purchase of third party ownership interests in a former japanese joint venture  sales and operating revenues increased while volumes decreased 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or compared to the period  primarily due to increased international expansion as well as million of additional costs from the previously mentioned acquisitions 
performance materials reported record operating income of million for  a increase compared to million for sales and operating revenues increased  from  million for to  million for  reflecting increased prices 
the gross profit margin increased to from in  resulting in a million increase in operating income 
pounds per shipping day decreased from million pounds for to million pounds for  resulting in an million decline in operating income 
when these volumes are adjusted for the maleic anhydride business transferred to marathon as part of the map transaction in the volumes decreased 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in the period  reflecting a million increase in environmental remediation expenses  while the period included million in gains from the sale of an idle plant and the termination of a product supply contract 
distribution distribution earned operating income of million for  a decrease from the record million earned for sales and operating revenues decreased from  million for  to  million for pounds sold per shipping day decreased in to million pounds from million pounds in  resulting in a million decrease in operating income 
gross profit as a percent of sales declined from for to for two factors primarily caused this decrease 
the first was unusually high margins in the prior period  resulting from hurricane supply disruptions 
the second was the limited ability of distribution to raise prices in a rising commodity cost environment due to demand weakness in the north american manufacturing sector 
the decline in gross profit margin lowered operating income by million compared to selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  m comparing the current period to the prior period in part due to a one time million adjustment in foreign postretirement benefit obligations 
distribution reported record operating income of million for  a increase compared to million for sales and operating revenues were a record  million for  a increase compared to  million for gross profit as a percent of sales decreased from for to for  but increased on a cents per pound basis  resulting in a million increase in operating income 
pounds per shipping day declined from million pounds in to million pounds in  reducing operating income by million 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million compared to the prior period  despite a million increase in environmental remediation expenses 
valvoline valvoline reported record operating income of million for  compared to an operating loss of million for the improvement in operating income primarily reflects gross profit margin recovery  which increased to in from in  as a result of stable base oil costs and the full effect of previous price increases 
this increase in gross profit margin during contributed million to operating income 
sales and operating revenues increased over the period to  million  reflecting increased pricing and product mix as volume levels decreased to million lubricant gallons 
valvoline instant oil change reported a million increase in operating income compared to the prior year driven by higher levels of customer satisfaction which contributed to an increase in same store sales revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million during primarily due to lower employee benefit costs as well as an unfavorable litigation charge recorded in the prior period 
valvoline reported an operating loss of million for  compared to operating income of million for the decline primarily reflected rapidly rising raw material costs which eroded the gross profit margin as it decreased from in to in  resulting in a million decline in operating income 
the lower margin reflected increases in material costs  which were not fully offset by price increases in the marketplace 
lubricant sales volumes declined  from million gallons in to million gallons in  reflecting a weak consumer market 
the net impact of volume fluctuations in all product lines resulted in an million decrease in operating income 
also included in results was an impairment charge of million related to certain valvoline instant oil change locations 
international operating income declined primarily due to higher raw material costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million compared to the prior year  reflecting higher costs related to the sap enterprise resource planning project  litigation issues and severance 
water technologies water technologies earned operating income of million for  compared to million for  which included an million currency hedge gain related to the environmental and process solutions e ps acquisition 
sales and operating revenues increased to million in compared to million in  primarily due to the million in sales and operating revenues contributed by the e ps business during the entire current year  which had only reported four months in the prior period 
the marine and industrial businesses combined revenue increase of  on a comparable twelve month basis  and the improving gross profit margin have been the primary factors in the operating income improvement in  while inclusion of the e ps business has also contributed to operating income growth 
operating income was also impacted during the current year by an million asset impairment charge on pathguard pathogen control equipment that was adjusted to fair value in conjunction with the decision to exit the poultry processing market 
water technologies reported operating income of million for compared to million for results for included an million foreign currency hedge gain on the may acquisition of the water treatment business of degussa ag and a million gain on insurance settlements  partially offset by a million charge for severance costs due to restructuring the business 
the operations acquired in the degussa acquisition  now operating as the e ps group within water technologies  added million to operating income 
excluding the impact of these items  operating income declined million 
sales and operating revenues increased to million in  compared to million in the e ps business accounted for million  or  of the increase 
the gross profit margin decreased from in to in  as price increases could not keep pace with rising raw material costs 
this decrease also reflects the acquired e ps business  which has a lower gross profit percentage than ashland s other water businesses 
unallocated and other unallocated and other costs  consisting of certain legacy costs or items clearly not associated with the operating segments  were million in  million in and million in these amounts included a million charge for costs associated with ashland s voluntary severance offer in and  as previously described  costs previously allocated to apac of million in and million in in addition to the ongoing costs that typically occur each year related to formerly owned businesses  included million of income from the reversal of certain environmental m remediation reserves due to favorable developments as well as million in income recorded from favorable experiences related to ashland s self insurance program 
included in were million in environmental remediation expenses  income of million from an insurance claim recovery and income of million from the favorable adjustment to the previously estimated withdrawal premium due oil insurance limited oil  the energy industry mutual insurance consortium in which ashland terminated its participation effective december  included in were million in charges for estimated future premiums due oil  resulting from a higher level of losses than anticipated for the members of oil  due primarily to the effects of a highly active hurricane season during loss gain on the map transaction see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the map transaction and the resulting pretax gain of  million recorded in ashland recorded a loss on the map transaction of million in as a result of a decrease in the discounted receivable from marathon for the estimated present value of future tax deductions 
in  a million loss resulted primarily from a million reclassification of certain tax benefits related to previously owned businesses of ashland 
the offsetting benefit was recorded in income taxes as deferred tax benefits 
loss on early retirement of debt see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the early retirement of debt associated with the map transaction  which resulted in a pretax loss of million recorded in net interest and other financing income costs the following table summarizes the components of net interest and other financing income costs 
in millions net interest and other financing income costs interest income interest expense expenses on sales of accounts receivable other financing costs the decrease in interest expense and increase in interest income for and reflect the retirement of most of ashland s debt from the utilization of proceeds from the map transaction in june as described in note c of notes to consolidated financial statements  and the temporary investment of the remaining proceeds in cash equivalents and short term  available for sale securities 
income tax expense benefit ashland s income tax expense for  and included million of tax expense and million and million of tax benefits  respectively  due to the resolution of domestic and foreign tax matters and the reevaluation of income tax reserves related to tax positions taken in prior years 
in addition  during ashland recorded a million tax benefit related to dividends held within the employee stock ownership plan  primarily due to the special dividend of paid on october  as part of the distribution to shareholders of a substantial portion of the apac divestiture proceeds 
for further information on this special dividend see note m of notes to consolidated financial statements 
ashland s income tax benefit for also included a benefit of million and million associated with the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the tax free gain on sale from the map transaction 
for additional information on this transaction see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements 
excluding these identified items  ashland s adjusted effective tax rate was in  compared to in and in the overall effective rate was lower in and than in due to ashland s lower level of pretax income from continuing operations and the resulting larger relative portion of those earnings derived from income taxed at less than the full us statutory rates 
see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation of ashland s tax provision for the last three years to the us statutory rate 
income from discontinued operations net of income taxes results of ashland s discontinued operations are summarized below 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements for an explanation of these amounts 
m in millions income from discontinued operations net of income taxes apac results of operations loss gain on sale of operations asbestos related litigation reserves and expenses electronic chemicals ashland periodically updates the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos related litigation reserves  which resulted in a net million adjustment during in addition  ashland reassessed its assumption for a certain asbestos receivable due to improved credit quality  which resulted in an million after tax adjustment during ashland recorded an after tax gain on the sale of apac of million in during  a subsequent tax adjustment of million reduced this gain on the sale of apac 
net income from the results of operations of apac amounted to million in and million in the increase from to reflected improved margins on construction jobs and material sales and favorable weather 
financial position liquidity cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations  a major source of ashland s liquidity  amounted to a cash inflow of million in  million in and a cash outflow of million in the cash outflow in was primarily related to cash distributions from map of million in during  ashland paid income taxes of million  compared to million in and million in ashland contributed million to its qualified pension plans in  compared with million in and million in cash receipts for interest income was million in and and million in  while cash payments for interest expense amounted to million in  million in and million in cash flows from operating activities of discontinued operations  consisting primarily of the operating cash flows from apac  amounted to a cash outflow of million in and cash inflows of million in and million in following the map transaction in june  moody s lowered ashland s senior debt rating from baa to ba  their highest non investment grade rating  and also lowered ashland s commercial paper rating from p to n p not prime  citing the annual cash flow lost from the operations sold 
in august  standard poor s lowered ashland s senior debt rating from bbb to bb  their highest non investment grade rating  and lowered ashland s commercial paper rating from a to b  citing ashland s intention to distribute the apac proceeds to shareholders instead of using the proceeds for business investment 
in november  ashland terminated its commercial paper program 
during  ashland replaced its revolving credit agreement with a new five year revolving credit facility which provides for up to million in borrowings 
up to an additional million in borrowings is available with the consent of one or more of the lenders 
the borrowing capacity under this new facility was reduced by million for letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement at september  the revolving credit agreement contains a covenant limiting the total debt ashland may incur from all sources as a function of ashland s stockholders equity 
the covenant s terms would have permitted ashland to borrow billion at september   in addition to the actual total debt incurred at that time 
permissible total ashland debt under the covenant s terms increases or decreases by for any increase or decrease in stockholders equity 
at september   working capital excluding debt due within one year amounted to  million  compared to  million at the end of ashland s working capital is affected by its use of the lifo method of inventory valuation 
that method valued inventories below their replacement costs by million at september  and million at september  liquid assets cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities and accounts receivable amounted to of current liabilities at september   compared to at september  capital resources on september  ashland s board of directors authorized the distribution of a substantial portion of the proceeds of the sale of apac to the ashland common stock shareholders as a one time special dividend 
each shareholder of record as of october   received per share  for a total of million 
this amount is accrued as dividends payable in the consolidated balance sheet at september  and was subsequently paid during substantially all of the remaining proceeds were directed to be used to repurchase ashland common stock in accordance with the terms authorized m by ashland s board of directors 
see note m of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of ashland s share repurchase programs 
ashland repurchased million shares for million during  million shares for million during and million shares for million during since the inception of the first described share repurchase program on july  through september   ashland has repurchased a total of million shares at a cost of million 
these repurchases represent approximately of the shares outstanding on june  the stock repurchase actions were consistent with certain representations of intent made to the internal revenue service with respect to the transfer of map 
property additions excluding the property additions of the discontinued operations of apac averaged million during the last three years and are summarized in the information by industry segment on page f for the past three years  performance materials accounted for of ashland s capital expenditures  while valvoline accounted for  distribution accounted for and water technologies accounted for 
capital used for acquisitions amounted to million during the last three years  of which million was invested in performance materials  million in water technologies  million in valvoline and million in distribution 
a summary of the capital employed in ashland s current operations as of the end of the last three years follows 
in millions capital employed performance materials distribution valvoline water technologies during  ashland reduced its total debt by million to million and stockholders equity increased by million to billion 
increases in stockholders equity resulted from million of net income  million from issuance of common shares under stock incentive and other plans  million of translation gains associated with foreign operations  a million decrease in the pension and other postretirement liability and million in unrealized gains on cash flow hedges were partially offset by decreases resulting from common stock repurchases of million and regular cash dividends of million 
debt as a percent of capital employed was at september  compared to at september  during  ashland expects capital expenditures of approximately million compared with million in the budgeted expenditures for include million for compliance matters  million for maintenance of capabilities  million for productivity enhancements and cost reductions  and million for growth projects of which million is specifically related to china projects 
in  ashland initiated a multi year sap enterprise resource planning erp project that is expected to increase efficiency and effectiveness in supply chain  financial  and environmental  health and safety processes 
the implementation of the erp system began in october in canada  continued during fiscal for all us operations  and was successfully launched in our european  middle eastern and african operations in october ashland now has more than of global revenue converted and functioning on this one erp system  which is a significant milestone 
these conversions were achieved primarily during fiscal and  despite substantial risk of potential business interruption and delay in daily operations  no significant implementation problems have occurred 
the total cost of the project through fiscal has been million  of which million has been capitalized 
cash expenditures are expected to decrease in fiscal and future periods  however increased depreciation charges estimated to be approximately million will begin to occur during fiscal the following table aggregates ashland s obligations and commitments to make future payments under existing contracts at september  contractual cash obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable have been excluded

e ashland issues various types of letters of credit as part of its normal course of business 
for further information see note h of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements ashland and its subsidiaries are lessees of office buildings  retail outlets  transportation equipment  warehouses and storage facilities  and other equipment  facilities and properties under leasing agreements that expire at various dates 
in june  ashland used million of the proceeds from the map transaction to purchase assets primarily apac construction equipment and vioc stores formerly leased under operating leases 
future minimum rental payments were not affected by this purchase 
capitalized lease obligations are not significant and are included in long term debt 
as part of its normal course of business  ashland is a party to various financial guarantees and other commitments 
these arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk that are not included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the possibility that ashland would have to make actual cash expenditures in connection with these obligations is largely dependent on the performance of the guaranteed party  or the occurrence of future events that ashland is unable to predict 
ashland has reserved the approximate fair value of these guarantees in accordance with the provisions of interpretation no 
fin guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees 
on march   ashland entered into a five year agreement to sell  on an ongoing basis with limited recourse  up to a million undivided interest in a designated pool of accounts receivable 
under the terms of the agreement  new receivables were added to the pool and collections reduced the pool 
ashland retained a credit interest in these receivables and addressed its risk of loss on this retained interest in its allowance for doubtful accounts 
receivables sold excluded defaulted accounts or concentrations over certain limits with any one customer 
on march   this agreement was extended for a period of one year and the capacity was increased to million 
the agreement was terminated by ashland on july  application of critical accounting policies the preparation of ashland s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include long lived assets  employee benefit obligations  income taxes  reserves and associated receivables for asbestos litigation and environmental remediation 
although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has reviewed the estimates affecting these items with the audit committee of ashland s board of directors 
long lived assets the cost of plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
useful lives are based on historical experience and are adjusted when changes in planned use  technological advances or m other factors show that a different life would be more appropriate 
such costs are periodically reviewed for recoverability when impairment indicators are present 
such indicators include  among other factors  operating losses  unused capacity  market value declines and technological obsolescence 
recorded values of property  plant and equipment that are not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows are written down to current fair value  which generally is determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows assets held for use or net realizable value assets held for sale 
asset impairment charges were million in  million in and were not significant in although circumstances can change considerably over time  ashland is not aware of any impairment indicators that would necessitate periodic reviews on any significant asset within property  plant and equipment at september  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests 
such tests are completed separately with respect to the goodwill of each of ashland s reporting units  which are operating segments or business units within these operating segments 
because market prices of ashland s reporting units are not readily available  management makes various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of those units 
fair values are based principally on ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization multiples of peer group companies for each of these reporting units 
ashland did not recognize any goodwill impairment during  and the most recent annual impairment tests indicated that the fair values of each of ashland s reporting units with significant goodwill were in excess of their carrying values by at least and the consolidated fair values exceeded carrying values by approximately 
despite that excess  however  impairment charges could still be required if a divestiture decision were made with respect to a particular business included in one of the reporting units 
employee benefit obligations ashland and its subsidiaries sponsor contributory and noncontributory qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all employees in the united states and in a number of other countries 
benefits under these plans generally are based on employees years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding their retirement 
in addition  the companies also sponsor unfunded postretirement benefit plans  which provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees who retire or are disabled 
retiree contributions to ashland s health care plans are adjusted periodically  and the plans contain other cost sharing features  such as deductibles and coinsurance 
life insurance plans generally are noncontributory 
as of september   ashland revised certain demographic assumptions used to determine its pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
the mortality assumption was changed to the rp combined mortality table with mortality improvement projected forward from the base year of by seven years for annuitants and years for nonannuitants using scale aa 
the previous mortality assumption was the rp combined mortality table for males and females healthy lives projected to using scale aa 
the turnover and retirement rates are based upon actual experience and were not revised 
these changes were effective as of september  for disclosure purposes and will be effective for expense 
the principal economic assumptions used to determine ashland s pension and other postretirement benefit costs are the discount rate  the rate of compensation increase and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
because ashland s retiree health care plans contain various caps that limit ashland s contributions and because medical inflation is expected to continue at a rate in excess of these caps  the health care cost trend rate has no material impact on ashland s postretirement health care benefit costs 
beginning september   ashland developed the discount rate used to determine the present value of its obligations under the us pension and postretirement health and life plans by matching the stream of benefit payments from the plans to the citigroup pension discount curve spot rates 
ashland changed to this approach to better reflect the specific cash flows of these plans in determining the discount rate 
the discount rate determined as of september  was for the us pension plans and for the postretirement health and life plans 
non us pension plans followed a similar process based on financial markets in those countries where ashland provides a defined benefit pension plan 
the weighted average discount rate for ashland s us and us pension plans combined was as of september  previously  the discount rate for us pension plans was based on the moody s aa corporate bond index  adjusted for longer durations of the pension plans as compared to the shorter duration of the index  and also adjusted to convert the semi annual coupons in the index to an annual discount rate 
ashland s expense under both us and us pension plans is determined using the discount rate as of the beginning of the fiscal year  which amounted to a weighted average rate of for  for and for the rates used for the postretirement health and life plans were for  for and for the expense for the pension plans will be based on a weighted average discount rate of  while will be used for the postretirement health and life plans 
the weighted average rate of compensation increase assumptions were for  for and for the compensation increase assumptions for the us plans were for  for and for the weighted average long term expected rate of return on assets was assumed to be in  in and in the long term expected rate of return on assets for the us plans was assumed to be in  m in and in for  the us pension plan assets generated an actual return of  compared to in and in however  the expected return on plan assets is designed to be a long term assumption  and actual returns will be subject to considerable year to year variances 
ashland has generated compounded annual investment returns of and on its us pension plan assets over the last five year and ten year periods 
the rate of compensation increase assumption for the us plans will remain at and the expected return on us plan assets will remain at in determining ashland s pension costs for shown below are the estimated increases in pension and postretirement expense that would have resulted from a one percentage point change in each of the assumptions for each of the last three years 
in millions increase in pension costs from decrease in the discount rate increase in the salary adjustment rate decrease in the expected return on plan assets increase in other postretirement costs from decrease in the discount rate income taxes ashland is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining ashland s provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities 
income taxes are accounted for under fasb statement no 
fas  accounting for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid  currently payable or receivable  and those deferred 
under fas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax loss carryforwards 
the effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the enactment date changes 
valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in the ordinary course of ashland s business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
ashland is regularly under audit by tax authorities 
accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
although ashland believes it has appropriate support for the positions taken on tax returns  a liability has been recorded that represents ashland s best estimate of the probable loss on certain of these positions 
ashland believes that the recorded accruals for all known tax liabilities are adequate for all open years  based on the assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter 
although ashland believes the recorded assets and liabilities are reasonable  tax regulations are subject to interpretation and tax litigation is inherently uncertain 
therefore  ashland s assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions 
although ashland believes that the estimates and assumptions supporting its assessments are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
based on the results of an audit or litigation  a material effect on ashland s income tax provision  net income  or cash flows could result in the period such a determination is made 
due to the complexity involved  ashland is not able to estimate the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts recorded 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with this interpretation is a two step process 
the first step is a recognition process to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is assessed to determine the cost or benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this interpretation will be recognized as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
based on ashland s current assessment  the cumulative effect of adopting fin is expected to decrease retained earnings by less than million 
m asbestos related litigation ashland is subject to liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos 
such claims result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in in connection with the sale of riley stoker corporation riley  a former subsidiary 
although riley was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos  its industrial boilers contained some asbestos containing components provided by other companies 
ashland retained hamilton  rabinovitz associates  inc hr a to assist in developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs given various assumptions 
the methodology used by hr a to project future asbestos costs is based largely on ashland s recent experience  including claim filing and settlement rates  disease mix  enacted legislation  open claims  and litigation defense and claim settlement costs 
ashland s claim experience is compared to the results of previously conducted epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases 
those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been exposed to asbestos 
using that information  hr a estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed  as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims 
from the range of estimates  ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs 
during the most recent update of this estimate completed during  it was determined that the reserve for asbestos claims should be increased by million 
this increase in the reserve was based on the results of a non inflated  non discounted year model developed with the assistance of hr a 
this increase resulted in total reserves for asbestos claims of million at september   compared to million at september  projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict 
in addition to the significant uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received  other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant  the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure  dismissal rates  costs of medical treatment  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies that are co defendants in claims  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards 
furthermore  any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
in light of these inherent uncertainties  ashland believes its asbestos reserve represents the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes 
as a part of the process to develop ashland s estimates of future asbestos costs  a range of long term cost models is developed 
these models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs  as well as other variables mentioned previously 
ashland has estimated that it is reasonably possible that total future litigation defense and claim settlement costs on an inflated and undiscounted basis could range as high as approximately billion  depending on the combination of assumptions selected in the various models 
previously estimated to be billion  this high range approximation decreased primarily as a result of a change in the projected long term inflation rate assumed by ashland 
in conjunction with the annual update performed in  management adjusted the assumed long term rate from to to better reflect the upper end of expected long term inflation trends 
if actual experience is worse than projected relative to the number of claims filed  the severity of alleged disease associated with those claims or costs incurred to resolve those claims  ashland may need to increase further the estimates of the costs associated with asbestos claims and these increases could potentially be material over time 
ashland has insurance coverage for most of the litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in connection with its asbestos claims  and coverage in place agreements exist with the insurance companies that provide most of the coverage currently being accessed 
as a result  increases in the asbestos reserve have been largely offset by probable insurance recoveries 
the amounts not recoverable generally are due from insurers that are insolvent  rather than as a result of uninsured claims or the exhaustion of ashland s insurance coverage 
ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on management s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage  including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent 
approximately of the estimated receivables from insurance companies at september   are expected to be due from domestic insurers  of which have a credit rating of a or higher by a

the remainder of the insurance receivable is due from london insurance companies  which generally have lower credit quality ratings  and from underwriters at lloyd s  which is reinsured by equitas limited 
ashland discounts a substantial portion of this piece of the receivable based upon the projected timing of the receipt of cash from those insurers 
during a significant amount of equitas reinsurance of liabilities became reinsured by national indemnity corporation  a member of the berkshire hathaway group of insurance companies with a current a

best rating of a 
as a result ashland reassessed its assumptions for the receivable recorded from equitas  and due to the improved credit quality of this portion of the receivable  ashland increased its recorded receivable by million during m at september   ashland s receivable for recoveries of litigation defense and claim settlement costs from insurers amounted to million  of which million relate to costs previously paid 
receivables from insurers amounted to million at september  during  the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve described above  and its impact on the valuation of future recoveries from insurers was updated  which resulted in an additional million increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries 
environmental remediation ashland is subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts collectively environmental remediation at multiple locations 
at september   such locations included waste treatment or disposal sites where ashland has been identified as a potentially responsible party under superfund or similar state laws  current and former operating facilities including certain operating facilities conveyed to map and about  service station properties  of which are being actively remediated 
ashland s reserves for environmental remediation amounted to million at september   compared to million at september   of which million at september  and million at september  were classified in noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
the total reserves for environmental remediation reflect ashland s estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable  without regard to any third party recoveries 
engineering studies  probability techniques  historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation 
ashland regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues 
ashland has estimated the value of its probable insurance recoveries associated with its environmental reserve based on management s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage 
at september  and ashland s recorded receivable for these probable insurance recoveries was million and million  respectively 
environmental remediation expense is included within the selling  general and administrative expense caption of the statements of consolidated income and on an aggregate basis amounted to million in  million in and million in environmental remediation expense  net of receivable activity  was million in  million in and million in environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect ashland s ability to estimate its share of the costs 
such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site  the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations  widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods  changes in environmental regulations  the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology  and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites 
although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation  ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites could be as high as approximately million 
no individual remediation location is material to ashland  as its largest reserve for any site does not exceed of the remediation reserve 
outlook ashland is focused on continuing to grow as a diversified  global chemical company  both organically and through acquisitions 
ashland s strong financial position and balanced approach to growth should create value for its investors and deliver needed solutions to its customers 
performance materials reported billion in revenue during fiscal while approximately of this revenue is generated within north america  performance materials continues to leverage its products and market expertise to accelerate international growth 
although performance materials is exposed to cyclical periods within the global economy due to considerable exposure to the construction and transportation industries  as this past year s financial results indicate  this business will continue to benefit from the increasing use of composites and adhesives in a variety of markets and applications 
performance materials key strategy for expansion is to grow organically by focusing on material substitution in the construction and transportation industries while continuing to introduce premium products in new geographies and develop new technologies and applications within existing markets 
acquisitions will be considered in cases where it can enhance this growth strategy 
distribution is a billion revenue business with an established network primarily in the north america market  where over of its revenue is generated 
distribution will continue to focus upon expanding efficiencies in supply chain integration and operational consolidation as well as leveraging customer relationships across all of ashland s businesses 
future financial results will remain dependent upon the north american manufacturing climate and distribution s ability to control costs 
growth in this business will occur through new product offerings and suppliers as it utilizes all of ashland s existing channels 
m valvoline recorded revenue of billion during the current fiscal year with over of its revenue generated from operations within north america  although it continues to grow its global presence each year 
at the end of fiscal valvoline initiated a considerable business model redesign in the midst of severe margin compression due to a tight base oil market 
this redesign contributed to valvoline s record operating income performance during fiscal given a stable base oil environment valvoline is positioned to continue its solid performance in future periods 
water technologies has undertaken a significant business model redesign during fiscal  as it prepares to leverage and enhance its expertise across its entire customer base 
previously operating under three distinct divisions  these have been restructured to fully utilize its resources and customer base while creating a market focused organization 
with a business that exceeds million in revenue  water technologies operates globally with  and of its revenue generated from operations in europe  north america and asia pacific  respectively  creating a large scale and platform for organic growth 
during fiscal  of ashland s revenue was generated from outside north america  which is a six percentage point increase compared to the prior twelve month period 
this reflects ashland s belief that there are substantial growth opportunities globally  particularly in eastern europe and china 
ashland has positioned its businesses to take advantage of various growth opportunities in these fast developing economies and has devoted key resources to realize this growth 
in addition to certain geographies  ashland has identified key interests within the automotive marine  construction and water markets that fit within its core capabilities 
ashland is transforming into a global  market focused  process centered  diversified chemical company as growth will be based on each business becoming more sensitive to market needs instead of product focused 
in millions quarterly operating income december march june september effects of inflation and changing prices ashland s financial statements are prepared on the historical cost method of accounting and  as a result  do not reflect changes in the purchasing power of the us dollar 
although annual inflation rates have been low in recent years  ashland s results are still affected by the cumulative inflationary trend from prior years 
certain of the industries in which ashland operates are capital intensive  and replacement costs for its plant and equipment generally would exceed their historical costs 
accordingly  depreciation and amortization expense would be greater if it were based on current replacement costs 
however  because replacement facilities would reflect technological improvements and changes in business strategies  such facilities would be expected to be more productive than existing facilities  mitigating at least part of the increased expense 
ashland uses the lifo method to value a substantial portion of its inventories to provide a better matching of revenues with current costs 
however  lifo values such inventories below their replacement costs 
monetary assets such as cash  cash equivalents and accounts receivable lose purchasing power as a result of inflation  while monetary liabilities such as accounts payable and indebtedness result in a gain  because they can be settled with dollars of diminished purchasing power 
ashland s monetary assets continues to currently exceed its monetary liabilities  leaving it more exposed to the effects of future inflation than in the past  when that relationship was reversed 
however  given the recent consistent stability of inflation in the us in the past several years as well as forward economic outlooks  current inflationary pressures seem moderate 
m forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis md a contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  with respect to ashland s operating performance 
these estimates are based upon a number of assumptions  including those mentioned within md a 
such estimates are also based upon internal forecasts and analyses of current and future market conditions and trends  management plans and strategies  weather  operating efficiencies and economic conditions  such as prices  supply and demand  cost of raw materials  and legal proceedings and claims including environmental and asbestos matters 
although ashland believes its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  it cannot assure the expectations reflected herein will be achieved 
this forward looking information may prove to be inaccurate and actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated if one or more of the underlying assumptions or expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized or if other unexpected conditions or events occur 
other factors and risks affecting ashland are contained in risks and uncertainties in note a of notes to consolidated financial statements and in item a of this annual report on form k 
ashland undertakes no obligation to subsequently update or revise these forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ashland regularly uses commodity based and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage its exposure to price fluctuations associated with the purchase of butane and natural gas  as well as certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
all derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value 
changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows 
gains and losses related to a hedge are either recognized in income immediately to offset the gain or loss on the hedged item  or deferred and recorded in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet as a component of total comprehensive income loss and subsequently recognized in the statements of consolidated income when the hedged item affects net income 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a hedge is recognized in income immediately 
ashland has typically designated a limited portion of its foreign currency derivatives as qualifying for hedge accounting treatment  but their impact on the consolidated financial statements has not been significant 
credit risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts  but exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts 
ashland further minimizes this credit risk through internal monitoring procedures and as of september  does not have significant credit risk on open derivative contracts 
the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in commodity prices or foreign currency rates on ashland s open commodity based and foreign currency derivative instruments at september  would not significantly affect ashland s consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or liquidity
