liquidity and capital resources operating activities as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
net cash provided by used in continuing operations was million in compared to million in and million in this increase in cash from operations was due primarily to an increase in earnings from continuing operations and increases in non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes and share based compensation

on january   we funded the acquisition of corsolutions with the proceeds from term loans and revolving credit loans pursuant to a credit agreement and a second lien term loan facility with bank of america  na  as administrative and collateral agent the new credit facilities 
the new credit facilities  as amended  provide for borrowings of up to an aggregate of million and were divided between a first lien credit facility and a second lien credit facility

b on november   we amended the terms of the new credit facilities and prepaid the second lien credit facility with proceeds from the first lien credit facility 
amounts borrowed under the term loan b facility and the term loan c facility accrue interest at a variable spread over libor  with the applicable spread determined by the company s consolidated leverage ratio  as described in the applicable credit agreement 
interest rates for these facilities  as well as for the term loan facility  are reset quarterly

under the amended agreement  the first lien credit facility was increased by million  the proceeds of which were used to prepay the second lien credit facility 
borrowings under the first lien credit facility bore interest at libor plus  a basis point reduction from the second lien credit facility 
all the other terms and conditions of the credit agreement other than those relating to the increased amount of the first lien credit facility and those that are no longer applicable because they relate solely to the second lien credit facility remain unchanged 
we incurred fees and expenses of approximately million  which were recorded as deferred financing costs and are being amortized over the term of the first lien credit facility january 
on february   we entered into a third amendment to the new credit facilities  the terms of which increased our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility from million to million 
all other terms of the new credit facilities  as amended  remain unchanged 
the new credit facilities contain  among other things  various representations  warranties and affirmative  negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type 
the negative covenants include  without limitation  certain limitations on transactions with affiliates  liens  making investments  the incurrence of debt  sales of assets  and changes in business 
the financial covenants contained in the new credit facilities include a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated fixed charges coverage ratio 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants of the new credit facilities 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we made prepayments of million toward the reduction of the first lien credit facility 
of this amount  million and million were paid from proceeds from the facet and dia real divestitures  respectively  and million was paid from our operating cash flows 
as of december   the outstanding balance under the new credit facilities was million 
in february and may  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements totaling million notional amount to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates related to the new credit facilities 
the swap agreements had the economic effect of converting million of our floating rate debt under the new credit facilities to fixed rate debt 
under the terms of the agreements  we will pay the bank fixed base rates of and  respectively  and the bank will pay us floating rates based on three month libor and  respectively  at december  
we reflected the interest rate swap agreements on the consolidated balance sheet at a fair value of  at december   which was based upon the estimated amount we would pay upon settlement of the agreements  taking into account interest rates at december  for the year ended december   we recognized a net gain of  from the cash flow hedges  which is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
in september  we entered into a forward exchange agreement with a bank to eliminate the potential impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the us dollar equivalent of the expected euro proceeds from the sale of dia real 
under the terms of the agreement  we agreed to sell million at the forward rate and receive approximately million on the settlement date 
we reported the forward exchange agreement at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet until it was settled in october in  we completed the sale of million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due we received proceeds  net of discount  of million from the issuance of the convertible senior subordinated notes 
we used the proceeds and proceeds from the sale of substantially all of the assets of our direct to consumer pharmacy and supplies business to fund the repurchase of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes  which had an aggregate principal amount of million  tendered in a tender offer 
this repurchase resulted in a net cash payment of million 
in june  we recorded a charge of million  or million  net of taxes  related to the repurchase of substantially all of the senior notes 
on april   we issued a notice of our intention to redeem our million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes on may  in response to the redemption notice  all noteholders converted their notes into shares of the company s common stock prior to the redemption date  and the company issued approximately million shares of common stock per share 
in addition  the redemption also required us to make a make whole payment equal to the present value  as of the redemption date  of all remaining scheduled interest payments on the notes through may  we paid the noteholders the make whole payment totaling million per share  which included  of accrued but unpaid interest 
the make whole payment  excluding the accrued but unpaid interest  was accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 induced conversion of convertible debt 
since the conversion was pursuant to the original conversion terms and no inducement was made to the noteholders  no loss was recognized with respect to the make whole payment  excluding the accrued but unpaid interest  or the shares issued 
proceeds received from participants under our stock purchase and stock option plans totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
we believe that our cash  other liquid assets  operating cash flows and new credit facilities  taken together  will provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements  planned capital expenditures and contractual obligations through the remainder of contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have various contractual obligations that are appropriately recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
certain other items  such as operating lease obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed 
the following sets forth our future minimum payments required under contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by year total thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations other long term obligations acquisition obligations does not include the interest expense associated with the long term debt obligations 
discussed above under liquidity and capital resources investing activities and below under other factors affecting liquidity 
principal and interest payments of million and million  respectively  under the new credit facilities are payable in capital expenditures of approximately million are estimated in as we continue to enhance our computer information systems 
we have restricted funds of million as of december   which represent amounts held in escrow related to customer contracts 
funds are held in interest bearing investment accounts 
as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k  except for our indemnification obligations related to potential breaches of the representations and warranties contained in the definitive agreements to sell facet and dia real  which obligations are capped at million and million  respectively 
other factors affecting liquidity in connection with our acquisitions of winninghabits and miavita  we are required to pay additional consideration in future periods  based upon the attainment of defined operating objectives of these businesses 
in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  we accrue contingent consideration obligations upon attainment of the objectives 
additionally  any such payments result in increases in goodwill 
we currently estimate that the additional consideration pursuant to the terms of our earn out agreement for the winninghabits acquisition is million 
the estimated additional consideration  which is included in acquisition contingent consideration on the consolidated balance sheet  is based on the attainment of the operating objectives for the year ended december   and is subject to final audit 
the final amount for winninghabits will be payable in also included in acquisition contingent consideration is million of earn out consideration for the second earn out period ending march   for the miavita acquisition 
on november   we entered into a settlement agreement and release with the seller that effectively amends the terms of the original acquisition agreement to fix the amount payable for the second earn out period at million plus times net revenues from certain new customers between november   and march   provided that no payment is payable in respect of the second earn out period unless payments received from such new customers between november   and may   are at least  goodwill was increased by million at december   for the consideration paid during and the estimated additional consideration payable under the earn out agreements described above 
uncertainties pursuant to the merger agreement under which we acquired corsolutions  we are pursuing a claim before a contractually designated settlement accountant for certain post closing adjustments including a million claim relating to a liability resulting from corsolutions pre closing performance under a customer contract 
we are also pursuing a related claim for fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment before the american arbitration association in chicago  illinois  seeking damages in an unspecified amount exceeding million 
there is no assurance that we will prevail in either of these proceedings 
we are subject to various legal claims and actions incidental to our business and the businesses of our predecessors  including product liability claims and professional liability claims 
we maintain insurance  including insurance covering professional and product liability claims  with customary deductible amounts 
there can be no assurance  however  that i lawsuits will not be filed against us in the future  ii our prior experience with respect to the disposition of litigation is representative of the results that will occur in pending or future cases or iii adequate insurance coverage will be available at acceptable prices  if at all  for incidents arising or claims made in the future 
there are no pending legal or governmental proceedings to which we are a party that we believe would  if adversely resolved  have a material adverse effect on us 
for a discussion of other risks and uncertainties that may affect our business  see risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most challenging  subjective or complex judgments  often because they must estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe our most critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible accounts 
our services are provided telephonically and  in some cases  in a patient s home from care centers located throughout the united states 
in addition  our services are provided through access to our online health and wellness based tools 
revenues are recognized as the related services are rendered and are net of contractual allowances and related discounts 
our services are paid for primarily on the basis of i monthly fees for each employee or member enrolled in a health plan  ii each member identified with a particular chronic disease or condition under contract  iii each member enrolled in our programs  iv fee for service  or v a fixed rate per case 
billings for certain services occur in advance of services being performed 
such amounts are recorded as unearned revenues in the consolidated balance sheets 
such amounts are subsequently recognized as revenue as services are performed 
some contracts provide that a portion of our fees are at risk ie  refundable if our programs do not achieve certain financial cost savings and clinical performance criteria 
revenues subject to refund are not recognized if i sufficient information is not available to calculate performance measurements  or ii interim performance measurements indicate that we are not meeting performance targets 
if either of these two conditions exists  we record the amounts as unearned revenues in the consolidated balance sheets 
if we do not meet performance levels by the end of the operations period under the contract  we are contractually obligated to refund some or all of the at risk fees 
in  revenues from continuing operations were derived from the following types of customers and third party payors approximately from health plans  from employers  from government payors and from administrative services only aso self insured employer clients 
a significant portion of our revenues is billed to third party reimbursement sources 
therefore  the collectibility of all of our accounts receivable varies based on payor mix  general economic conditions and other factors 
a provision for doubtful accounts is made for revenues estimated to be uncollectible and is adjusted periodically based upon our evaluation of current industry conditions  historical collection experience  recoveries of amounts previously provided  industry reimbursement trends and other relevant factors which  in the opinion of management  deserve recognition in estimating the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
the evaluation is performed at each reporting period for each operating unit with an overall assessment at the consolidated level 
while estimates and judgments are involved and factors impacting collectibility may change  management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from final determination of amounts to be collected 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of identifiable net assets acquired 
goodwill arising from business combinations is accounted for under the provision of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and is not amortized 
our identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
as of december   we reported goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at net carrying amounts of million and million  respectively 
the total of million represents approximately of our total assets as of december  we review goodwill and identifiable intangibles for impairment annually as of december and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in testing for impairment  we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related reporting units that have goodwill and indefinite life intangibles assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment 
we estimate the fair values of the reporting units based upon earnings multiples for similar precedent transactions as well as the present value of estimated future free cash flows 
the approach utilized is dependent on a number of factors  including estimates of future revenues and operating costs  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
we base our estimates on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
therefore  future impairments could result if actual results differ from those estimates 
based on our evaluation  we concluded that no impairment of recorded goodwill and intangibles existed at december accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
additionally  the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
the income tax expense benefit for continuing operations was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
reflected in each year were various non deductible permanent differences between tax and financial reporting 
as of december   our remaining net operating loss carryforwards of million  the tax effect of which is reflected as an asset on the balance sheet in the deferred income taxes  will be available to offset future taxable income liabilities 
based on projections of taxable income in and future years  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will fully realize the value of the recorded deferred income tax assets 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
share based compensation 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions  as we formerly did  using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board  apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
changes in assumptions as to the employee forfeitures assumptions  exercise dates and volatility could have a significant impact on the stock compensation fair value determinations 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  which contain additional accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates  and this disclosure  with the audit committee of our board of directors 
recently issued and recently adopted accounting standards accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
in june  the fasb published interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the effective date of this interpretation is january   the first fiscal year beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the provisions of fin to determine its impact  if any  on our financial statements but presently anticipate that its adoption will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
fair value measurements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of this new standard and have not concluded our analysis on the impact  if any  on our results of operations and financial position 
prior year misstatements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab no 

sab no 
addresses quantifying the financial statement effects of misstatements  specifically  how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in current year financials 
under the provisions of sab no 
 a reporting entity must quantify and evaluate errors using a balance sheet approach and an income statement approach 
after considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors  if either approach results in a misstatement that is material  a reporting entity s financial statements must be adjusted 
sab no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after november  we adopted the provisions of sab no 
in the fourth quarter of and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of  net of income taxes of  to our january  consolidated balance sheet 
we identified two uncorrected misstatements for consideration under sab  each of which was considered immaterial to our results of operations in any reporting period when using only the income statement approach we historically used to assess the materiality of unrecorded errors an unrecorded liability for drugs and supplies from a major vendor  which is included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets  resulted from an accumulation of unrecorded costs over several periods prior to this misstatement was identified in the amount required at january   to correct the liability balance would result in a  charge to our results of operations in during  we discovered that our medical device inventory  which is included in property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets  was overstated due to improper recording of disposed and lost medical devices and the related depreciation expense 
the misstatement originated in and accumulated over subsequent periods 
the amount required to correct the medical device inventory balance at january   would result in a  charge to our results of operations in under the balance sheet approach and the income statement approach  or the dual approach  we determined that correcting the above misstatements would be material to our financial statements and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to our january   consolidated balance sheet upon our initial application of sab item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt 
our primary interest rate risk relates to the new credit facilities and our interest rate swap facilities 
in february and may  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million with a bank under which we will pay the bank fixed base rates of interest of and  respectively  and the bank will pay us floating rates based on three month libor and  respectively  at december  
the agreements  which have a two year term  have the economic effect of converting a portion of our floating rate debt to fixed rate debt 
based upon the total amount outstanding at december   not covered by interest rate swaps  a hypothetical two percentage point increase in the interest rates for a duration of one year would result in additional interest expense of approximately million
