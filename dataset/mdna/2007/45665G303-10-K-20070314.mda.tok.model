item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the section titled risk factors in part i of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
dpi merger on september   discovery partners international  inc  or dpi  completed a merger with infinity pharmaceuticals  inc  or ipi  pursuant to which a wholly owned subsidiary of dpi merged with and into ipi 
ipi was the surviving corporation in the merger  changed its name to infinity discovery  inc  or old infinity  and became a wholly owned subsidiary of dpi 
in addition  we changed our name from discovery partners international  inc to infinity pharmaceuticals  inc 
and our ticker symbol on the nasdaq global market to infi 
upon completion of the merger  our common stock was issued to old infinity stockholders  and we assumed all of the stock options  stock warrants and restricted stock of old infinity outstanding as of september  immediately following the closing of the merger  former old infinity stockholders  option holders and warrant holders owned approximately of the combined company on a fully diluted basis and former dpi stockholders  option holders and warrant holders owned approximately of the combined company on a fully diluted basis 
in addition  after completion of the merger  the business conducted by the combined company became the one operated by old infinity prior to completion of the merger 
since former old infinity security holders owned  immediately following the merger  approximately of the combined company on a fully diluted basis and as a result of certain other factors  including that former old infinity directors constituted a majority of the combined company s board of directors and all members of the combined company s executive management were from old infinity  old infinity was deemed to be the acquiring company for accounting purposes and the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of assets and a recapitalization in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  for all purposes  including sec reporting  our financial statements for periods prior to the merger reflect the historical results of old infinity  and not dpi  and our financial statements for all subsequent periods reflect the results of the combined company 
in addition  because the business conducted by the combined company became the one operated by old infinity prior to the completion of the merger  the discussion below describes the business of old infinity prior to completion of the merger and the business of the combined company after the merger 
unless specifically noted otherwise  as used herein  the terms infinity  we  us and our refer to the combined company after the merger and the business of old infinity prior to the merger  and dpi refers to the business of discovery partners international  inc prior to completion of the merger 
business overview our mission is to discover  develop  and deliver to patients best in class medicines for the treatment of cancer and related conditions 
we have built a pipeline of innovative product candidates for multiple cancer indications  all of which represent proprietary applications of our expertise in small molecule drug technologies 
in the near term  the key driver of our success will be our ability to successfully commence and complete clinical trials for our product candidates and advance the development of our discovery stage research programs 
in the longer term  the key driver of our success will be our ability to commercialize products based upon our proprietary technologies  either alone or together with our collaboration partners 

table of contents our lead product candidate  ipi  is currently being studied in a phase i clinical trial in patients with gleevec refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumors  or gist  as well as a phase i ii clinical trial in patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 
we also have completed enrollment in and are analyzing data from our phase i clinical trial of ipi in patients with refractory multiple myeloma 
to date  ipi has been well tolerated and we have seen promising evidence of biological activity in the gist trial 
we currently expect to initiate additional clinical trials of ipi during  including one or more phase ii clinical trials in the second half of the year in indications to be determined based on the preclinical and clinical data we generate  phase i studies combining ipi with existing approved therapies in earlier line disease  and a human clinical trial of an oral formulation of ipi ipi is an inhibitor of heat shock protein  or hsp hsp is a molecule that maintains the structure and activity of specific proteins  known as client proteins of hsp many cancers result from specific mutations in these client proteins  hsp enables those cancers to survive by allowing the client proteins to continue functioning 
our next most advanced program is directed against the hedgehog cell signaling pathway  which we refer to as the hedgehog pathway 
normally  the hedgehog pathway regulates tissue and organ formation during embryonic development 
when abnormally activated during adulthood  however  the hedgehog pathway is believed to play a central role in allowing the proliferation and survival of certain cancer causing cells  and is implicated in many of the most deadly cancers 
our hsp and hedgehog pathway inhibitor programs are being pursued in collaboration with medimmune  inc  or medimmune 
the goal of our third program  which is being undertaken in collaboration with the novartis institutes for biomedical research  or novartis  is to identify small molecule compounds that inhibit the bcl family of proteins 
these proteins are key regulators of programmed cell death  or apoptosis 
cancers that have higher than normal levels of bcl are believed to evade apoptosis and become increasingly resistant to chemotherapy 
using our proprietary small molecule drug discovery technologies  we have identified selective inhibitors of bcl and its related protein family member  bcl xl  and are performing lead optimization activities on these compounds 
we also have other research programs that target cancer and related conditions 
we have incurred net losses since inception as we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development  including early stage clinical trials 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we continue to expend substantial resources seeking to successfully research  develop  manufacture  obtain regulatory approval for  market and sell any product candidates 
we expect that  in the near term  we will incur substantial losses relating primarily to costs and expenses relating to our efforts to advance the development of ipi  including those related to an oral formulation of the compound  and our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program 
collaboration agreements we have entered into a product development and commercialization agreement with medimmune to jointly develop and commercialize novel small molecule cancer drugs  including ipi  targeting hsp  as well as those targeting the hedgehog pathway 
under the terms of our agreement with medimmune  we will share equally with medimmune all development costs  as well as potential profits and losses  from any future marketed products 
medimmune made a non refundable  up front payment totaling million to us in order to obtain co exclusive rights to the hsp and hedgehog pathway development programs 
in addition  we could receive up to million in milestone payments if certain late stage development and sales objectives are achieved for products resulting from the collaboration  such that total payments to us could equal million 
if any products are successfully developed under the collaboration  we have the right to co promote these products in the united states  with our promotional costs being included among those that are shared under the collaboration 
we may opt out of a program under the collaboration  in which case we would receive a royalty on sales of products arising from the program  if any  instead of a share of profits and losses 

table of contents we have also entered into an alliance with novartis to discover  develop and commercialize drugs targeting the bcl family of proteins 
under our agreement with novartis  novartis has paid us a million up front license fee  an affiliate of novartis has made a million equity investment in us  and novartis has committed to provide us research funding of approximately million over the initial two year research term  which expires in february novartis has also agreed to make aggregate milestone payments of over million if certain research  development and commercialization milestones are met for multiple products for multiple indications  such that total payments to us could exceed million 
in addition  we are entitled to receive royalties upon successful commercialization of any products developed under the alliance 
the two companies will conduct joint research to identify molecules for clinical development 
once a clinical candidate is identified  we can participate in the clinical development of the candidate under specified conditions 
this clinical development will be led and paid for by novartis 
upon commercialization of any products developed under the collaboration  we have an option to co detail bcl family inhibitors in the united states  with our detailing costs to be reimbursed by novartis 
we have also entered into three technology access alliances relating to our diversity oriented synthesis technologies that have provided us with over million in up front license fees  equity payments and other near term committed revenues and  with respect to one such alliance  potential milestone and royalty payments upon successful commercial development of select products resulting from the alliance partner s use of the compounds to develop drug candidates 
pursuant to these alliances  novartis international pharmaceutical ltd  or novartis international  amgen inc  or amgen  and johnson johnson pharmaceutical research development  a division of janssen pharmaceutica nv  or j j  have each been granted non exclusive rights to use subsets of our collection of diversity oriented synthesis compounds for use in their respective internal drug discovery programs 
financial overview revenue all of our revenue to date has been derived from license fees  the reimbursement of research and development costs  and contract service revenue received from our collaboration partners 
where the agreement with a collaboration partner  such as our agreement with novartis  provides that the partner will provide research funding for our research and development efforts  we recognize this cost reimbursement as revenue in the period earned 
in the future  we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales  research and development support services and milestone payments in connection with strategic relationships  and royalties resulting from the sales of products developed under licenses of our intellectual property 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of license fees  research and development reimbursement  milestone and other payments received under our collaborative or strategic relationships  and the amount and timing of payments that we receive upon the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
if we fail to complete the development of our drug candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them  our ability to generate future revenue  and our results of operations and financial position  would be materially adversely affected 
research development expense since inception  we have focused on drug discovery and development programs  with particular emphasis on cancer drugs 
we currently have three lead programs in research and development ipi  which is currently being studied in phase i clinical trials for the treatment of refractory gist and advanced nsclc  a program seeking to develop candidate compounds directed against the hedgehog pathway  and our bcl program 

table of contents the ipi and hedgehog pathway inhibitor programs are being conducted in collaboration with medimmune and the bcl program is being conducted in collaboration with novartis 
our research and development expense primarily consists of the following compensation of personnel associated with research activities  including consultants and contract research organizations  laboratory supplies and materials  manufacturing drug candidates for preclinical testing and clinical studies  preclinical testing costs  including costs of toxicology studies  fees paid to professional service providers for independent monitoring and analysis of our clinical trials  depreciation of equipment  and allocated costs of facilities 
under our collaboration with medimmune  we share research and development expenses for our hsp and hedgehog pathway inhibitor programs equally with medimmune 
because this is a cost sharing arrangement  we will record payments we receive from medimmune for its share of the development effort as a reduction of research and development expense 
general administrative expense general and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  legal  business development  information technology infrastructure  corporate communications and human resources functions 
other costs include facilities costs not otherwise included in research and development expense and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
general and administrative expense also consists of the costs of maintaining and overseeing our intellectual property portfolio  which include the salaries of in house patent counsel  the cost of external counsel and the associated filing and maintenance fees 
other income expense interest expense and other interest and investment income primarily consist of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  net of interest expense  and amortization of warrants 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued drug development costs and assumptions in the valuation of stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to aid you in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition to date  our revenues have been generated under research collaboration agreements and  accordingly  we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 

table of contents the terms of these research collaboration agreements may include payment to us of non refundable up front license fees  funding or reimbursement of research and development efforts  milestone payments if specified objectives are achieved  and or royalties on product sales 
we divide agreements containing multiple elements into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the collaborative partner and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered obligation s 
for these agreements  we allocate the consideration that we receive among the separate units based on their respective fair values or the residual method  and we apply the applicable revenue recognition criteria to each of the separate units 
we recognize revenues from non refundable  up front license fees on a straight line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance  which is typically the research or development term 
we recognize research and development funding as earned over the period of effort 
we regularly consider whether events warrant a change in the estimated period of performance under an agreement 
such a change would cause us to modify the period of time over which we recognize revenues from the up front license fees paid to us under that agreement and would  in turn  result in changes in our quarterly and annual results 
to date  we have not made any such changes 
we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if the milestone payment is non refundable  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions is not met  we defer the milestone payment and recognize it as revenue over the estimated period of performance under the contract as we complete our performance obligations 
we will recognize royalty revenue  if any  based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by the licensee  and in the period the sales occur 
we have not recognized any royalty revenues to date 
we exercise our judgment in determining whether an agreement contains multiple elements and  if so  how much revenue is allocable to each element 
in addition  we exercise our judgment in determining when our significant obligations have been met under such agreements and the specific time periods over which we recognize revenue  such as non refundable  up front license fees 
to the extent that actual facts and circumstances differ from our initial judgments  our revenue recognition with respect to such transactions would change accordingly and any such change could affect our reported operating results 
research and development expense research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred 
we have entered into certain collaboration agreements in which expenses are shared with the collaborator  and others in which we are reimbursed for work performed on behalf of the collaborator 
we record all of these expenses as research and development expense 
if the arrangement is a cost sharing arrangement and there is a period during which we receive payments from the collaborator  we record payments from the collaborator for its share of the development effort as a reduction of research and development expense 
if the arrangement is a cost sharing arrangement and there is a period during which we make payments to the collaborator  we will record our payments to the collaborator for its share of the development effort as additional research and development expense 
if the arrangement provides for reimbursement of research and development expenses  we record the reimbursement as revenue 
our collaboration with medimmune is a cost sharing arrangement  our collaboration with novartis provides for the reimbursement of our research and development expenses 
accrued drug development costs as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service 
table of contents performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date 
examples of services for which we must estimate accrued expenses include contract service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations and clinical trial sites in connection with preclinical studies and clinical trials 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided 
the majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred by our service providers  or if we over or underestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in any given period  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
we often rely on subjective judgments to determine the date on which certain services commence  the extent of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us 
to date  we have been able to reasonably estimate these costs 
as the activities being performed by external service providers increase  such as for additional clinical trials and drug manufacturing activities  it will become increasingly difficult for us to estimate these costs  and our estimates of expenses for future periods may  consequently  be over or underaccrued 
stock based compensation we adopted financial accounting standards board statement no

sfas no 
r requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other equity compensation 
through december   we elected to follow apb and related interpretations in accounting for our share based compensation plans for employees  rather than the alternative fair value method provided for under sfas no 
accordingly  when options granted to employees had an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant  no compensation expense was recognized in our financial statements  and we disclosed in the notes to our financial statements pro forma disclosures in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 

through december   we accounted for transactions in which services are received from non employees in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received or of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured  in accordance with sfas no 
and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
accounting for equity instruments granted or sold by us under apb  sfas no 
 sfas no 
r and eitf issue no 
requires fair value estimates of the equity instrument granted or sold 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments are too high or too low  our expenses may be over or understated 
prior to the completion of the merger  our common stock had never been publicly traded 
prior to that date  the fair value of our common stock for accounting purposes was determined by old infinity s board of directors with input from management 
because we were not profitable and did not have significant revenue  we believed that a key factor in determining changes in the fair value of our common stock was the stage of  and changes in  our clinical pipeline 
in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  the progression of a drug candidate from preclinical development into clinical trials and the progression from one phase of clinical trials to the next may increase the enterprise s fair value 
in addition to this factor  old infinity s board of directors determined the fair market value of our common stock based on other objective and subjective factors  including its knowledge and experience in valuing early stage life sciences companies  comparative values of public companies  discounted for the risk and limited liquidity provided for in the shares subject to the options we had issued  
table of contents pricing of private sales of our preferred stock  prior valuations of stock grants  the effect of events that had occurred between the times of such determinations  and economic trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries specifically  and general economic trends 
from december  until the closing of the merger  in addition to the foregoing factors  the board of directors considered contemporaneous estimations of the fair value of our common stock using the probability weighted expected return method  as of december   and again as of march  to estimate the increase in our value created by our collaboration with novartis 
these valuation analyses and the resulting estimates of our enterprise value were based on the market valuation method  specifically the guideline company approach 
the enterprise value was allocated to the different classes of our equity instruments using the probability weighted expected return method 
upon the announcement of the proposed merger on april   the board of directors began considering the price of dpi s common stock in determining fair market value 
we use our judgment in determining the fair value of our common stock  including in selecting the inputs we use in the black scholes valuation model 
equity instrument valuation models are by their nature highly subjective 
any significant changes in any of our judgments  including those used to select the inputs for the black scholes valuation model  could have a significant impact on the fair value of the equity instruments granted or sold and the associated compensation charge  if any  we record in our financial statements 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and the following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended december  and  in thousands  together with the change in each item in dollars and as a percentage 
for the years ended december  change change revenue research and development expense general and administrative expense interest expense interest and investment income debt extinguishment charge   n a income taxes   n a revenue our revenue during the year ended december  consisted of approximately million associated with the amortization of the up front license fee received from medimmune upon entry into our strategic alliance in august  million in license fees received upon the amendment of our technology access agreement with amgen in july  million related to the amortization of the non refundable license fee  and million related to the reimbursable research and development services we performed  under our bcl collaboration entered into with novartis in february  
table of contents million related to the delivery of compounds to novartis international under our technology access agreement  and million related to the delivery of compounds to j j under our technology access agreement 
our revenue during the year ended december  related entirely to the delivery of compounds to j j under our technology access agreement 
research and development expense research and development expenses represented approximately and of our total operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including sfas no 
r stock based compensation  for our research and development personnel  and an increase of million in external costs for toxicology studies and clinical trials of ipi and our hedgehog pathway inhibitor compounds 
during the year ended december   our research and development expense includes a credit of approximately million attributable to amounts reimbursable by medimmune under the cost sharing provisions of our collaboration agreement  as well as a million asset impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of with respect to certain laboratory equipment that we are no longer using 
we began to track and accumulate costs by major program starting on january  our major research and development costs prior to december  were largely related to ipi during the year ended december   we estimate that we incurred the following expenses by program 
these expenses primarily relate to payroll and related expenses for personnel working on the programs  drug development and manufacturing  preclinical toxicology studies and clinical trial costs 
in addition  for the ipi and hedgehog pathway inhibitor programs  these expenses include a credit of approximately million attributable to amounts reimbursable by medimmune following entry into our collaboration agreement in august program year ended december  ipi million hedgehog pathway inhibitors million bcl million we do not believe that the historical costs associated with our lead drug development programs are indicative of the future costs associated with these programs or represent what any other future drug development program we initiate may cost 
for example  while we expect our research and development expenses to increase as our programs progress through preclinical and clinical development  those expenses attributable to the ipi and hedgehog pathway programs will be shared equally with medimmune in future periods 
further  there is significant uncertainty regarding our ability to successfully develop any drug candidates 
these risks include the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials of ipi and any other clinical trials that we may commence in the future  the scope  rate and progress of our preclinical studies and other research and development activities  clinical trial results  
table of contents the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights relating to our programs under development  the terms and timing of any strategic alliance  licensing and other arrangements that we have or may establish in the future relating to our programs under development  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost of establishing clinical supplies of any product candidates  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
a further discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our drug development programs on schedule  or at all  and the potential consequences of failing to do so  are set forth in part i of this report under the heading risk factors 
because of the risks inherent in drug discovery and development  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our programs  the anticipated completion dates of these programs  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence  if at all  from the programs described above and any potential future product candidates 
any failure by us or one of our strategic alliance partners to complete any stage of the development of any potential products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
general and administrative expense the increases in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  as compared to year ended december  are primarily attributable to an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including sfas no 
r compensation expense for general and administrative employees  and new employees we hired in anticipation of becoming a public company  and an increase of million in outside service fees  including audit  legal and consulting  primarily related to our becoming a public company and becoming compliant with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expense will increase in future periods as a consequence of our operation as a public company  including costs incurred in connection with maintaining compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  hiring of additional personnel  and investor relations activities 
we also expect to incur internal and external business development costs  which may vary from period to period 
interest expense interest expense increased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of borrowings made in under our debt facilities with oxford finance corporation  or oxford  and horizon technology funding company llc  or horizon 
we repaid in full all of our outstanding debt to oxford and horizon in december interest and investment income interest and investment income increased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of our higher balance of cash and available for sale securities at 
table of contents december  the increased cash and available for sale securities balance is primarily attributable to amounts we received upon completion of the merger  up front license fees received from medimmune and novartis in connection with our collaborations  and proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock 
debt extinguishment charge in connection with the early retirement of our outstanding indebtedness to oxford and horizon in december  we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of approximately million 
this debt extinguishment charge represents the write off of the unamortized portion of the warrants that we issued to oxford and horizon when we originally entered into these debt facilities  as well as the prepayment penalty 
income taxes our income tax expense of approximately million for the year ended december  relates to the alternative minimum tax driven by new collaborations we entered into during the year ended december  we do not expect to incur income tax expense in comparison of the years ended december  and the following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended december  and  in thousands  together with the change in each item in dollars and as a percentage 
years ended december change change revenue n a research and development expense general and administrative expense interest expense interest and investment income revenue revenue for the year ended december  related entirely to the delivery of compounds to j j under our technology access agreement 
we recorded no revenue during the year ended december  research and development expense the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase of million for external costs of clinical trials related to ipi and toxicology studies primarily related to ipi and hedgehog pathway inhibitor product candidates and manufacturing for preclinical testing and or clinical trials of ipi and hedgehog pathway inhibitor product candidates  an increase of million for personnel costs  research supplies and other costs related to research and development activities  including laboratory equipment related expenses and research and development facilities 
general and administrative expense the increase in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase of million for personnel costs and related expenses  and an increase of million for legal  intellectual property and trademark costs and investor relations cost 

table of contents interest expense interest expense decreased during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of our repayment during of outstanding principal amounts under our debt facilities 
interest and investment income interest and investment income increased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to higher yields earned on our investments due to an increase in interest rates 
these yields were slightly offset by lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and investments in liquidity and capital resources we have not generated any revenue from the sale of drugs to date  and we do not expect to generate any such revenue for the next several years  if at all 
we have instead relied on the proceeds from sales of equity securities  interest on investments  license fees  expense reimbursement under our collaborations  contract service payments and debt to fund our operations 
because our product candidates are at an early stage of clinical and preclinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain  we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or whether  or when  we may achieve profitability 
our cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities and working capital are as follows december  december  cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities working capital years ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above cash flows the principal use of cash in operating activities in all of the periods presented was the funding of our net loss 
cash flows from operations can vary significantly due to various factors  including changes in accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable  as well as changes in accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenue 
in september  we received million from medimmune  representing one half of the up front license payment related to our collaboration agreement 
in february  we received a million up front license payment related to our collaboration agreement with novartis 
other significant working capital changes during the year ended december  were primarily due to the unbilled receivable of million for the second tranche of the medimmune up front license payment due in january and deferred revenue for the full million medimmune up front license payment less the million recognized as revenue during the year 
during the year ended december   we completed the merger with dpi  which resulted in proceeds of million in cash and million in available for sale securities 
we also received million in proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock 
we borrowed million from oxford and horizon during the 
table of contents year ended december  these amounts were offset by million in principal payments under our debt facilities during  including the early retirement of our outstanding indebtedness to oxford and horizon in december we believe that our cash and cash equivalents at december   together with the million payment that we received from medimmune in early january  will be sufficient to support our current operating plan  including planned increases in research and development and general and administrative expenses  through at least december  our currently planned operating and capital requirements primarily include the need for working capital to  among other things continue clinical development of an intravenous formulation of ipi  perform preclinical work on  and commence clinical development of  an oral formulation of ipi  perform preclinical work on  and commence clinical development of  compounds from our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program  and advance our additional discovery programs 
our future operating plan may change  however  as a result of many factors  including the progress and results of clinical trials of ipi and preclinical studies of an oral formulation of ipi  the results of discovery stage research and preclinical studies of potential hedgehog pathway inhibitors  the results of discovery stage research for bcl inhibitor compounds and other programs  and our decision to initiate clinical trials if supported by preclinical results  our ability to maintain our strategic alliances with medimmune and novartis  our ability to meet our compound delivery obligations to novartis international  the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals for our drug candidates  the cost of acquiring raw materials for  and of manufacturing  our drug candidates  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patents  and other patent related costs  including litigation costs  the costs of increasing our clinical research  medical and regulatory affairs and drug safety functions  the costs of establishing sales and marketing functions and of establishing commercial manufacturing arrangements if any drug candidates are approved  our needs for office and laboratory facilities and our ability to continue subleasing excess space  the costs required to satisfy our obligations under our alliance with medimmune  the timing and receipt of milestone payments under our collaboration agreements  and the timing  receipt and amount of sales  profits or royalties on future products  if any 
we will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses that we expect to incur in the long term in connection with planned preclinical and clinical testing  regulatory review  manufacturing and sales and marketing efforts 
we may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings  debt financings  strategic alliances and licensing arrangements 
such additional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  our stockholders ownership interests will be diluted  and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect their rights as stockholders 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting 
table of contents our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends 
if we raise additional funds through strategic alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties  we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or drug candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis  we could be required to curtail significant discovery stage drug discovery programs that are designed to identify new drug candidates  and or relinquish rights to drug candidates or development programs that we may otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves or jointly with our collaborative partners 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total and beyond equipment loans and capital leases  including interest software contract obligation accrued payment to strategic alliance partner operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet financing activities  including the use of structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues or results of operations since inception 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since a significant portion of our investments are in money market funds  asset backed securities  corporate obligations and us government agency obligations 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes
