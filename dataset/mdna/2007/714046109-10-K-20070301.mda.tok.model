in papers dated october   enzo biochem  inc and enzo life sciences  inc collectively  enzo filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  civil action no 
 against amersham plc  amersham biosciences  perkinelmer  inc  perkinelmer life sciences  inc  sigma aldrich corporation  sigma chemical company  inc  molecular probes  inc  and orchid biosciences  inc the complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with enzo  infringed enzo s patents  engaged in unfair competition and fraud  and committed torts against enzo by  among other things  engaging in commercial development and exploitation of enzo s patented products and technology  separately and together with the other defendants 
enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief 
in  the court severed the lawsuit and ordered enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants 
we subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that enzo s patents are invalid 
in july  the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in enzo s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and  we believe  excludes certain of our products from the coverage of enzo s patents 
discovery is ongoing 
no trial date has been set  but summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in january on october   amersham biosciences corp 
filed a complaint  which was subsequently amended  in the united states district court for new jersey  civil action no 
 against our subsidiary  alleging that our viewlux and certain of its image flashplate products infringe three of amersham s patents related to high throughput screening the nj case 
on august   amersham plc filed a complaint against two of our united kingdom based subsidiaries in the patent court of the english high court of justice  case no 
c  alleging that our same products infringe one corresponding amersham patent in the united kingdom  which was granted in august the uk case 
amersham seeks injunctive and monetary relief in both cases 
we filed answers and counterclaims in both cases 
on october   we filed a complaint  which was subsequently amended  against amersham in the united states district court for massachusetts  civil 
table of contents action no 
 alleging that amersham s in cell analyzer  and leadseeker multimodality imaging system and certain cyclic amp and ip assays infringe two of our patents related to high throughput screening the ma case 
we seek injunctive and monetary relief 
amersham subsequently filed an answer and counterclaims 
after a trial in the uk case in december  the court ruled in february that amersham s patent in question was invalid in the united kingdom and awarded costs to us 
amersham initiated an appeal of the ruling in the uk case but withdrew that appeal in january in may  the court in the nj case issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in amersham s patents that adopted many of amersham s claim construction positions 
our motion asking the court to reconsider that decision was denied 
discovery has not yet been completed in either the nj or ma case  nor has a trial date been set in either case 
a voluntary mediation occurred in september  but did not result in a resolution of these matters 
fact discovery  which was stayed pending the mediation  has now resumed 
at the suggestion of the court in the nj case  additional mediation is being scheduled 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings  and we are contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above matters 
we are currently unable  however  to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  if any  that may result from the resolution of these matters or to determine whether resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
during  the internal revenue service concluded its audit of federal income taxes for the years through we have agreed to the conclusions of the internal revenue service in all matters with the exception of one  and have filed a single issue protest with the appeals division of the internal revenue service 
we expect to resolve the matter in the first half of regardless of the outcome of the protest  we do not expect the final resolution to significantly impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we are under regular examination by tax authorities in the united states and other countries such as germany and the united kingdom in which we have significant business operations 
the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction 
we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these and subsequent years examinations 
we have established income tax reserves which we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments 
once established  reserves are adjusted as additional information becomes available and when an event occurs requiring a change to the reserves 
the resolution of tax matters is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition 
we are also subject to various other claims  legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities 
each of these matters is subject to uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us 
we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable 
in the opinion of our management  based on our review of the information available at this time  the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at december   should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements

principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity  increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt  a ratings downgrade that would limit our ability to borrow under our accounts receivable facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market  volatility in the markets for corporate debt  a decrease in the market price for our common stock  and volatility in the public equity markets

net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities was million in  compared to net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities of million in principal contributors to the generation of cash from operating activities during were net income from continuing operations of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
these amounts were offset in part by taxes paid on divestitures of million and a net increase in working capital of million 
contributing to the net increase in working capital in  excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate 
table of contents fluctuations  was an increase in inventory of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million  offset in part by a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
strong performance in accounts receivable collections in the life and analytical sciences segment was partially offset by increased accounts payable disbursements in both the life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics segments 
the increase in inventory is primarily the result of expanding the amount of inventory held at service locations within the life and analytical sciences segment 
there was no incremental use of our accounts receivable securitization facility during  which totaled million at both december  and january  changes in accrued expenses  other assets and liabilities and other items totaled million during  and primarily relates to timing of payments for tax  restructuring and salary and benefits

in addition  we incurred million of business development transaction costs  earn out payments and other costs in connection with these and previous transactions 
capital expenditures in were million  mainly in the areas of tooling and other capital equipment purchases  in addition to facility improvements 
these cash outflows were partially offset by million from the advance and settlement of an insurance claim  million received from the sale of property  plant and equipment  and million from the settlement of life insurance policies

in addition  we paid million of premium related to the prepayment of our senior subordinated debt and million to settle interest rate swaps on this debt 
we also paid million in dividends and million to purchase our common stock pursuant to a stock repurchase program we implemented in we borrowed million related to the repatriation of funds under the american jobs creation act of and received million from the exercise of employee stock options 
current borrowing arrangements senior unsecured credit facility 
on october   we entered into a million five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately million  originally issued under our previous credit agreement  are treated as issued under this agreement 
we use the senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes which may include working capital  refinancing existing indebtedness  capital expenditures  share repurchases  acquisitions and strategic alliances 
the interest rates under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin or the base rate from time to time 
the base rate is the higher of the corporate base rate announced from time to time by bank of america  na and the federal funds rate plus basis points 
we may allocate all or a portion of our indebtedness under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility to interest based upon the eurocurrency rate plus a margin or the base rate 
the eurocurrency margin as of december  was basis points  the weighted average eurocurrency rate was 
there were approximately million of borrowings under the facility as of december  with interest based on the above described eurocurrency rate 
at year end  the borrowings were undertaken by certain foreign subsidiaries of ours and the funds were borrowed in the subsidiaries functional currencies of euro eur  canadian dollars cad and japanese yen jpy 
the effective rates of the borrowings as of december  were as follows eur  cad and jpy 
our senior unsecured revolving credit facility contains covenants that require us to maintain specific financial ratios  including a minimum interest coverage ratio  and a maximum total leverage ratio 
at all times during  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
senior subordinated notes 
in december we issued ten year senior subordinated notes at a rate of with a face value of million the senior subordinated notes 
in the fourth quarter of  we commenced and substantially completed a tender offer and consent solicitation for any and all of the senior subordinated notes 
we repurchased all but thousand of these notes as of november  in connection with the tender offer  we solicited consents to amend the indenture under which the senior subordinated notes were issued and removed most of the restrictive covenants from the indenture 
off balance sheet arrangements receivables securitization facility 
during  we established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to maintain a receivables purchase agreement with a third party financial institution 
under this arrangement  we sold  on a revolving basis  certain of our accounts receivable balances to the consolidated subsidiary which simultaneously sold an undivided percentage ownership interest in designated pools of receivables to a third party financial institution 
as collections reduce the balance of sold accounts receivable  new receivables are sold 
our consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of credit loss on the receivables 
accordingly  the full amount 
table of contents of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for on our balance sheet 
the amount of receivables sold and outstanding with the third party financial institution may not exceed million 
under the terms of this arrangement  our consolidated subsidiary retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances 
the amount of receivables sold to the consolidated subsidiary was million as of december  and million as of january  at each of december  and january   an undivided interest of million in the receivables had been sold to the third party financial institution under this arrangement 
the remaining interest in receivables of million and million that were sold to and held by the consolidated subsidiary were included in accounts receivable in the consolidated financial statements at december  and january   respectively 
the agreement requires the third party financial institution to be paid interest during the period from the date the receivable is sold to its maturity date 
at december   the effective interest rate was libor plus approximately basis points 
the servicing fees received constitute adequate compensation for services performed 
no servicing asset or liability is therefore recorded 
the agreement also includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of bb or above  as defined by standard poor s rating services  and ba or above  as defined by moody s investors service 
at december   we had a senior unsecured credit rating of bbb with a stable outlook from standard poor s rating services  and of baa with a stable outlook from moody s investors service 
in january  our consolidated subsidiary entered into an agreement to extend the term of the accounts receivable securitization facility to january  dividends our board of directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of and  resulting in an annual dividend rate of cents per share

capital expenditures during  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million to million primarily to introduce new products  to improve our operating processes  to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations  to increase capacity in the amorphous silicon business and to develop information technology 
we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 

table of contents other potential liquidity considerations during  we repurchased in the open market million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million  including commissions 
these repurchases were made pursuant to our stock repurchase program announced in november the program 
the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares  with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value 
on november   we announced that our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million additional shares of our common stock under a new stock repurchase program the new program 
the new program will expire on october  unless this authorization is terminated earlier by our board 
the new program may also be suspended or discontinued at any time 
from january  through february   we repurchased million shares of our common stock in the open market under the new program at an aggregate cost of million  including commissions 
any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs 
if we continue to repurchase shares  the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources  including cash and cash equivalents and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
during and  we have received advance payments toward business interruption and building damage from an insurance claim for a chemical fire that occurred within our life and analytical sciences facility in boston  massachusetts in early the incident occurred during non business hours and no employee casualties or injuries were reported 
we expect that we will reach final settlement with the insurer in and believe we have sufficient insurance so that any gain or loss incurred by us in connection with this fire and environmental clean up should not have a material effect on our results of operations 
effects of recently adopted accounting pronouncement in december  the fasb issued sfas no

 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january   and prior to adoption we applied the intrinsic value based method prescribed in apb opinion no 
 as permitted by sfas no 
 in accounting for employee stock based compensation 
we generally did not recognize compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options because the options granted had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
in transitioning from apb opinion no 
to sfas no 
r  we have applied the modified prospective method 
accordingly  periods prior to adoption have not been restated and are not directly comparable to periods after adoption 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost recognized in periods after adoption includes i compensation cost for all stock based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 less estimated forfeitures  and ii compensation cost for all stock based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r  less estimated forfeitures 
the total pre tax stock based compensation expense for the cost of stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and performance units was million in the total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for stock based compensation was million in  respectively 
at december   total unrecognized stock based compensation expense  expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of fiscal years  amounted to million 
total unrecognized stock based compensation expense will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures  if any 

table of contents prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we presented all excess tax benefits related to stock compensation as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires the cash flows resulting from these tax benefits to be classified as cash flows from financing activities 
in  the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options was million  which was classified as cash flows from financing activities  as compared to million in  which was classified as cash flows from operating activities 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  unearned compensation was recorded in a contra equity account and established at the date restricted stock was granted  representing the amount of unrecognized restricted stock expense that would be reduced as expense is recognized 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  the recognition of unearned compensation at the date restricted stock is granted is no longer required 
therefore  in the first quarter of  the million of unrecognized restricted stock that had been recorded in unearned compensation in the consolidated balance sheet as of january  was reclassified to capital in excess of par value 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated

we will be required to adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal year we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
and have not yet determined the impact  if any  of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other postretirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for products that include installation  if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element  we recognize product revenue upon delivery  and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete 
for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met 
we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as we render services and the customer accepts them 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element  all in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long term customized projects  we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates 
further  we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 
warranty costs 
we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale 
warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material incurred in the warranty period 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible  and specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty 
therefore  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
this would reduce our earnings 
inventory valuation 
we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and or manufacture 
we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost 
generally  reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on 
table of contents hand and  when necessary  record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product 
if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels  we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
this would reduce our earnings 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 
business combinations 
the allocation of purchase price for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for purchase price allocation purposes 
in connection with the fair valuing of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  we are assisted by valuation consultants  and assessments of intangible assets using customary valuation procedures and techniques are performed 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates  the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets 
value of long lived assets  including intangibles 
we carry a variety of long lived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment  investments  identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill 
we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based  in part  upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows 
we undertake this review on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets and on a periodic basis for other long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished 
any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings 
we completed the annual impairment tests of goodwill for and and concluded that there were no impairments 
while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
in addition  we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our non amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite  the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 
employee compensation and benefits 
retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales  research and development  and selling  general and administrative expenses  in our consolidated statement of operations 
we incurred expenses of million in  million in and million in for our retirement and postretirement plans 
we expect expenses of approximately million in for our retirement and postretirement plans 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made 
we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied  to determine service cost and interest cost  in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year 
as of december   we estimated the expected long term rate of return of assets in our pension portfolios in the united states was  and was for plans outside the united states 
we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets  as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension assets 
our management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions  and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
discount rate assumptions have been  and continue to be  based on the prevailing market long term interest rates at the measurement date 
if any of our 
table of contents assumptions were to change  our pension plan expenses would also change 
a one quarter percent increase in the discount rate would decrease our net periodic benefit cost by million for in the united states and by million for for all plans outside the united states 
a one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pre tax pension expense by million for in the united states and by million for for all plans outside the united states 
we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature 
under the defined dollar plan feature  our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount  regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree 
our maximum future liability  therefore  cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 
restructuring activities 
our financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
our pre tax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of severance benefits to be granted to employees  based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades  costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub rental income and asset impairments as discussed above under value of long lived assets  including intangibles 
because these accruals are estimates  they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention 
for example  actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance  or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected 
in addition  unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates 
when such changes in estimates occur  they are reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled restructuring and integration reversals charges  net 
gains or losses on dispositions 
when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation  we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition 
this estimate is based on a variety of factors  including current interest in the market  alternative markets for the assets  and other relevant factors 
if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we record a loss 
if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated 
accordingly  we may realize amounts different than were first estimated 
during the year ended december   we recognized million in gains from disposition of fixed assets 
we also recorded million in gains from the disposition of discontinued operations  which consisted of gains from the final disposition of our aerospace  fluid testing  telecommunications components and technical services businesses  offset by losses associated with the disposition of our fiber optics test equipment and lithography businesses 
any such changes decrease or increase current earnings  and are recorded either against the gains on disposition or discontinued operations line items appearing in our income statement 
income taxes 
our business operations are global in nature  and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions 
tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries 
we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law 
our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions 
any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change 
such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are operational decisions  transactions  facts and circumstances  and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain 
furthermore  our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world 
where appropriate  we reserve for tax matters when we believe that the likelihood of an incremental liability being incurred is probable in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  
table of contents and sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts  law  tax rates  tax audit  or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense  our effective tax rate  or our cash flow 
additionally  in accordance with sfas no 
we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  foreign tax credits  other income tax credits and certain pension accruals 
valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable 
improvements or other changes in our operations  domestically and internationally  could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future 
the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments  marketable securities and accounts receivable 
we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of december  in the ordinary course of business  we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third party receivables and payables 
the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies  have maturities that do not exceed months  have no cash requirements until maturity  and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet 
credit risk is insignificant as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking institutions 
unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and  for hedges designated as cash flow  the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs 
for the year ended december   we did not engage in any designated cash flow hedges 
principal hedged currencies include the british pound gbp  canadian dollar cad  euro eur  japanese yen jpy  and singapore dollar sgd 
we held forward foreign exchange contracts with us equivalent notional amounts totaling million at december  and million as of january  the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant 
the gains and losses realized on foreign currency derivative contracts are not material and the duration of these contracts was generally days for we do not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 

table of contents market risk market risk 
we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 
foreign exchange risk 
the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us  as approximately of our business is conducted outside of the united states  generally in foreign currencies 
our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures 
the intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures  with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures 
moreover  we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states  material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the u 
s resulting in a natural hedge 
although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities  when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business  generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted 
foreign currency risk value at risk disclosure 
we utilize a value at risk model to determine the potential earning fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments 
as discussed above  we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program 
our value at risk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation  utilizing a confidence interval and a holding period of days 
as of december   this computation estimated that there is a chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than million 
this value at risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program 
specifically  during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal the value at risk was million  with an average of approximately million 
interest rate risk 
as described above  our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments 
fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short term cash flows  as they relate to interest  and our earnings 
interest rate risk sensitivity 
as of december   our debt portfolio consisted of million of variable rate debt 
in addition  our cash and cash equivalents  for which we receive interest at variable rates  were million at december  our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt  consisting of million of revolving debt facilities  to fluctuate 
an increase of  or approximately basis points  in current interest rates would cause an additional pre tax charge to our earnings of million for fiscal year changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate 
as described above  an increase of  or approximately basis points  in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by million for fiscal year changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest received to fluctuate
