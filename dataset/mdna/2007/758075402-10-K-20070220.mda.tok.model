item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary and outlook redwood trust  inc  together with its subsidiaries redwood  we  or us  is a financial institution focused on investing in  financing  and managing residential and commercial real estate loans and securities 
we seek to invest in assets that have the potential to provide high cash flow returns over a long period of time to help support our goal of distributing attractive levels of dividends per share 
for tax purposes  we are structured as a real estate investment trust reit 
we assume a range of credit risks in our investments  and the level of assumed risk dictates the manner in which we finance our purchase of  and derive income from  these investments 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which equals the interest income we earn from our investments in loans and securities less the interest expenses we incur from our borrowed funds and other liabilities 
our investments in residential  commercial  and cdo credit enhancement securities ces  or below investment grade securities have concentrated credit risk 
we finance the acquisition of most of our first and second loss ces that are directly exposed to credit losses  with capital 
we generally finance the acquisition of our third loss securities through our acacia securitization program 
our ces investments accounted for over of net interest income in to date  our primary credit enhancement investment focus has been in securities backed by high quality residential and commercial real estate loans 
high quality real estate loans are loans that typically have low loan to value ratios  borrowers with strong credit histories  and other indications of quality relative to the range of loans within us real estate markets as a whole 
our ces investment returns depend on the amount and timing of the interest and prin cipal collected on the loans in the pools supporting the securities 
in an ideal environment for our residential ces  we would experience fast loan prepayments and low credit losses which would  in turn  lead to attractive ces returns 
we encountered that type of environment from to the return on our residential ces investments would be adversely affected by slow loan prepayments and high credit losses 
our investments in real estate loans and investment grade securities have less concentrated credit risk 
to produce an attractive investment return on these lower credit risk assets  we use leverage 
we earn income based upon the spread between the yield on the acquired asset and the cost of funds we borrowed to acquire the asset 
we have obtained most of the debt financing used to acquire these assets through the issuance of asset backed securities abs under our sequoia and acacia securitization programs 
the debt incurred to acquire assets through sequoia and acacia is non recourse to redwood 
our reported gaap net income was million per share for our gaap net income was million per share in and was million per share in our gaap return on equity was for compared to for and for in  we declared four regular quarterly dividends of per share and a special dividend of per share 
table net income in thousands  except share data total interest income total interest expense net interest income operating expenses gains on sales gains on calls valuation adjustments  net provision for income taxes net income diluted common shares net income per share the largest factor in the decline in net income over the past year was a million drop in income from gains generated on the sale and call of assets 
in  we sold a significant amount of ces as part of a portfolio management strategy to reduce our level of residential credit risk and to free up capital 
we also benefited from a large number of calls of securities in another factor contributing to the decline in earnings was a decrease in net interest income of million primarily due to high prepayments on adjustable rate loans securitized under our sequoia program 
this decline was partially offset by an increase in yields from our securities portfolio primarily residential ces 
other factors include an increase of operating expenses of million and an increase in negative mark to market valuation adjustments of million primarily related to interest rate agreements 
the assets a ssociated with these interest rate agreements generally increased in value  but those increases were not recognized in gaap income 
these items were partially offset by a decrease in the tax provision of million due to a decrease in net income 
over the past two years  our strategy has been to lay the foundation for future growth by diversifying our investment and financing capabilities  strengthening the redwood team  and bolstering our systems and infrastructure 
at the same time  we have been steering our way through the disruption in the housing and loan markets by selling some of our riskiest credit assets  sticking to our investment discipline  and preserving capital 
in  we raised million of capital through the sale of common stock via our direct stock purchase plan and we raised million of capital from the sale of trust preferred securities 
additionally  we freed up million of capital for investment by selling and re securitizing a portion of our ces 
we absorbed all of this capital in  primarily through new investments in commercial and residential ces and investment grade securities 
at year end  we had million of excess capital  million less than at the beginning of the year 
we plan to increase our residential and commercial investment activity in compared to we expect that capital absorption will be fairly evenly split between investments in assets with less credit sensitivity and investments in cautiously selected credit enhancement securities 
we currently expect net capital absorption for will be between million and million 
to finance planned investments  we expect to use a combination of redwood debt  proceeds from securitization financings  and capital 
we plan to raise additional capital this year 
although the precise amount and sources of that additional capital are uncertain at this time  potential sources include the sale of stock through our direct stock purchase plan  public or private sales of common stock  and or issuance of trust preferred securities or other long term debt 
at year end  we had over billion of residential and commercial securities funded through our acacia cdo program 
the growth within this program over the past four years has been a significant achievement  as acacia has allowed us to more efficiently finance our assets and to diversify and expand our investment capabilities and product lines 
we achieved this growth in cdo financing by combining the acquisition skills of our residential and commercial portfolio managers with the well respected debt structuring skills of our cdo finance team 
during  we expect acacia s assets to continue to grow with the addition of a mix of less credit sensitive commercial and residential securities 
some of these assets may also be synthetic or derivative assets 
we believe that derivative assets can be an attractive investment alternative at a time of declining availability of new loans and securities 
over the next several years  we expect to continue diversifying the type of assets funded through acacia 
commercial real estate whole loans is one of the asset types we are exploring 
we feel strongly that real estate assets funded through acacia will continue to be a significant growth area for us 
residential whole loans present another opportunity for us to invest in assets with less concentrated credit risks 
our residential conduit is now an active buyer of hybrid and adjustable rate loans from major originators throughout the country 
in  we expect to increase our investment in residential loans 
expanding into less credit sensitive assets is clearly an attractive opportunity at the present time  but it is not intended to dilute the essential nature of our business 
over the long term  we expect that credit enhancing high quality residential and commercial real estate loans will remain our core activity 
our residential ces investments to date have largely focused on securities backed by prime quality loans 
the overall credit performance of loans backing our existing portfolio of prime ces is still strong  and continues to be significantly better than our initial loss estimates at the time of acquisition 
most of the current problems in the residential loan market involve subprime loans originated in late and in mortgage originators are being inundated by loan repurchase requests from investors due to underwriting violations and the poor credit performance of subprime borrowers 
we are not a mortgage loan originator  and our investment in residential ces backed by subprime loans totaled only million at year end we owned million subprime investment grade securities at year end these securities are generally performing within our expectations credit wise  and most of them are financed via acacia cdo securitization so changes in their market value in the absence of actual credit losses are generally of little concern to us 
over of these securities were rated bbb or higher 
the area of greatest concern in the subprime investment grade market today are subprime securities rated bbb and bbb that were issued in we owned million of subprime bbb and bbb securities at year end in january  we identified and sold million of the securities within this group that we believed were most at risk of being downgraded in the future 
these sales were accomplished at a small loss relative to our purchase price 
in the current housing climate we are taking a cautious approach to credit enhancing new residential loans of any type  but we do see opportunities to make attractive investments 
residential ces pricing continues to remain expensive due to high liquidity levels  strong demand  and a declining supply of new issuance 
we believe this condition will likely persist  especially for prime quality collateral 
we believe we can still make attractive returns even at these price levels  as long as the underlying credit quality is high and we don t face a serious economic recession 
we expect the quality of underwriting to improve in  and we expect to become a more active buyer of residential ces in the second half of we expect our primary target areas will be residential ces backed by prime and near prime alt a loans 
we will also be actively looking at subprime ces  but many unanswered credit questions still exist 
unless we see opportunities to buy subprime at prices lower than those currently prevailing  we expect our subprime ces investments in will remain relatively small 
our commercial group is now established in the marketplace as an investor in and manager of first loss and other commercial credit enhancement securities 
we were an active investor in commercial ces in this will continue to be our primary commercial real estate focus in our portfolio of commercial securities and loans continues to reflect current strong commercial market fundamentals 
on the whole  even though commercial properties are largely healthy  we believe the risks of credit enhancing commercial loans are increasing 
the tremendous amount of capital flowing into the cmbs sector has created more aggressive underwriting and has kept asset prices high 
the volume of our commercial ces investments in will largely depend on our ability to find assets that meet our relatively conservative investment criteria 
looking forward into  our biggest concern is the depth and duration of the housing market correction  and its ultimate impact on real estate credit 
to date  our assets have held up well 
our delinquencies and losses have increased somewhat  but are still at very low levels 
if the housing market takes a more severe downward turn  however  our credit results and earnings and dividends will be more seriously impacted 
additionally  further stress in the housing and credit markets might also cause pricing dislocations for housing related securities 
this will create buying opportunities for us  but also the fair market value of our current residential ces portfolio would likely decline 
we believe we are well positioned as we move forward into the new year 
we continue to expect quarter to quarter volatility in our gaap and taxable earnings for a variety of reasons  including some technical accounting and tax issues more fully described later 
we believe that our core strategy to build a highly efficient and entrepreneurial financial institution focused on real estate investment has us in a good position to capitalize on a wide range of investment opportunities in and beyond 
results of operations as compared to interest income total interest income consists of interest earned on consolidated earning assets  adjusted for amortization of discounts and premiums and provisions for loan credit losses

rate change is the change in rate between periods multiplied by the average portfolio balance in the prior period 
interest income changes that result from changes in both rate and volume were allocated to the rate change amounts shown in the table 
a further breakdown and discussion of the year over year changes for the real estate loan  real estate securities  and cash components of interest income follows below

this was due to high prepayments within our existing portfolio of libor indexed arms and a relatively low level of new loan acquisitions in this decline was partially offset by increased yields due to increases in the short term interest rates to which most of the residential real estate loans are indexed 
our residential real estate loan balance was billion at december   billion at december   and billion at december  the vast majority of these loans were one and six month libor adjustable rate residential loans libor arms that were financed through our sequoia securitization program 
the flattening of the yield curve that began in and continued through led to fast prepayments on our existing libor arms and caused origination levels of new libor arms to significantly decline 
in a flat yield curve environment  hybrid or fixed rate loans are a more attractive loan alternative 
additionally  new forms of adjustable rate mortgages negative amortization  option arms  and moving treasury average arms represent an increased share of the arm market 
prepayment rates for our residential loans increased from an average constant prepayment rate cpr of in to an avera ge cpr of in loan premium amortization expense increased to million in from million in the percentage increase in premium amortization expense was not commensurate with the decrease in our residential loan balance during this period 
the reason for this anomaly relates to the loan premium amortization method we use for loans acquired prior to july  which represented of the loan balance at december  and of the loan balance at december  for these loans  the premium amortization rate is somewhat influenced by prepayments  but is more significantly influenced by short term interest rates 
as short term rates increase  premium amortization slows  as short term rates decrease  premium amortization could accelerate in a material way 
see the potential for gaap earnings volatility discussion later in this document 
for the remainder of the loans which we acquired after july  we use a different accoun ting method for premium amortization  and as a result  the percentage of amortization is more closely correlated to prepayment rates 
during  we reversed million of our existing loan credit reserve into income 
on a percentage basis  the reduction in the credit reserve was lower than the overall decline in our outstanding residential loan balance 
the primary reason was a rise in residential loan delinquencies  which increased from of the current loan balance at december  to at december  this increase in delinquencies is in line with our expectations as our loan portfolio seasons 
delinquencies as a percent of original balances increased from at december  to at december  overall  residential loan credit performance remains significantly better than our original expectations 
interest income securities the tables below present the income and yields of the components of our securities for and table real estate securities interest income and yield dollars in thousands year ended december  yield as a result of interest income discount premium amortization total interest income average balance interest income discount premium amortization total interest income investment grade securities residential commercial cdo total investment grade securities credit enhancement securities residential commercial cdo total credit enhancement securities total real estate securities year ended december  yield as a result of interest income discount premium amortization total interest income average balance interest income discount premium amortization total interest income investment grade securities residential commercial cdo total investment grade securities credit enhancement securities residential commercial cdo total credit enhancement securities total real estate securities investment grade securities over the past year we shifted strategy to allocate more capital to investments in investment grade securities igs securities with less concentrated credit risks 
interest income from igs increased in as compared to due to portfolio growth and increased yields 
the majority of the igs acquired in were residential  in part because comparably rated commercial securities traded at relatively higher prices and lower yields 
the increase in yield is generally reflective of the rise in short term interest rates over the past year  as new securities were purchased in a higher interest rate environment and many existing securities have a variable interest rate that reset to higher levels 
most of the igs acquired in were financed through our acacia cdo securitization program 
in  we intend to continue to build our igs portfolio  with purchases financed with redwood debt in addition to funding through acac ia 
residential ces we acquire many first loss bonds at to of their principal value and other  more senior  credit enhancement securities at to of their principal value 
many of these securities are priced at a substantial discount to their principal value as future credit losses could reduce or eliminate the principal value of these securities 
our yields on these investments depend on how much principal and interest we eventually collect and how quickly we receive those payments 
the faster we collect principal and the longer it takes to realize credit losses  the better it is for our investment returns 
interest income from our residential ces was million in  a million increase over this increase is largely the result of higher yields in vs 
in  which resulted from the strong credit performance and faster than anticipated prepayments rates on ces on the underlying arms loans 
arms represented of our residential ces portfolio  and average actual prepayment rates were in excess of in compared to our initial expectations at the time of acquisition of to 
the increase in interest income also resulted from a higher average balance of residential ces in our portfolio 
this growth reflected our ability to find new assets at a pace in excess of our sales  calls  and principal payments 
igs and ces backed by option arms we own igs and ces that are backed by option arm mortgages  which give the borrower the option of making a minimum payment that is less than the amount of interest owed for that loan period 
the unpaid interest is added to the loan balance creating negative amortization neg am 
the amount of neg am interest we currently recognize or defer for gaap purposes on option arms securities depends on our expectation of collectibility 
we currently expect that accumulated neg am interest for securities rated bb and higher will be paid in full 
we will continue to monitor and assess this assumption 
in and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of neg am interest on securities rated bb and higher 
during these same time periods  we deferred recognition of neg am interest of million and million  respectively  on our unrated and b rated securities 
for these securities we will recognize this deferred interest as cash is received 
our cumulative deferred neg am interest is million at december  commercial ces interest income from our commercial ces was million in  a million increase over this increase is almost entirely the result of higher average balances 
we were active buyers of commercial ces in as we have become more established in this marketplace 
the average yield earned on our commercial ces portfolio in was 
the yield was low relative to other ces due to credit loss assumptions 
similar to residential  commercial ces are acquired at a net discount 
commercial ces generally have a ten year maturity and are not expected to receive principal prepayments prior to maturity 
as a result  it will take several years to reasonably assess credit performance and recognize any potential upside in yield from discount amortization 
interest income cash and cash equivalents interest income from cash and cash equivalents was million in  a million increase over this increase is largely the result of higher average excess cash balances and an increase in yield earned on cash 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest payments on redwood debt  consolidated asset backed securities abs issued from sponsored securitization entities  and junior subordinated notes 
the table below presents our interest income and balances for these components for and table total interest expense dollars in thousands year ended december  interest expense on redwood debt interest expense on consolidated abs interest expense on junior subordinated notes total interest expense average redwood debt balance average abs issued balance average junior subordinated notes balance average total obligations cost of funds of redwood debt cost of funds of abs issued cost of funds of junior subordinated notes cost of funds of total obligations total consolidated interest expense decreased to million in from million in this was caused by a significant decline in the balance of outstanding consolidated abs issued in as a result of rapid prepayments of the loans within these securitization entities 
offsetting much of the decline in balances was the higher cost of funds due to an increase in short term interest rates as most of our debt and consolidated abs issued is indexed to one  three  or six month libor 
these factors are illustrated in the table below 
table volume and rate changes for interest expense in thousands change in interest expense years ended december  vs

we have expanded our product lines and made significant investments in further developing our business processes and information technology systems 
our efforts to build for future growth are ongoing and we expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase in fixed compensation expense includes employee salaries and related employee benefits 
fixed compensation expense has increased in as compared to due to increased staffing levels 
our headcount increased from at december  to at december  variable compensation expense includes employee bonuses and the expense of equity awards granted to employees and directors 
employee bonuses are based on the adjusted return on equity earned by redwood and individual performance 
due diligence expenses are costs for services related to re underwriting and analyzing the loans we acquire or the loans we credit enhance through the purchase of securities 
due diligence expenses increased in compared to due to increased commercial ces activity 
these costs will fluctuate from period to period  depending on many factors such as the level of asset acquisitions 
other expenses include custodial fees  excise taxes  training  recruiting  and shareholder relations 
recognized gains on sales and calls the table below provides a detail of the net recognized gains on sales and calls for and table gains on sales and calls  net in thousands year ended december  real estate loan sales real estate securities sales realized gains on interest rate agreements gains on sales gains on calls of residential ces total gains on sales and calls gains on sales of securities were lower in compared to  as we sold a significantly higher level of ces in as part of our portfolio restructuring 
gains on calls were also significantly lower in compared to as we had fewer securities called by their issuers in  compared to based on the timing of call dates and anticipated prepayment speeds  we expect a continued low level of call income in valuation adjustments valuation adjustments reflect those changes in fair market values of assets that we recognize through our income statement 
these include writedowns of assets that are impaired under the provisions of eitf impairments are generally caused by an adverse change in projected cash flows in conjunction with a decrease in the fair market value 
there is no reversal of this impairment on assets  even if projected cash flows improve in the future 
the fair market value changes of those interest rate agreements accounted for as trading are also included in valuation adjustment 
all changes  whether positive or negative  of these particular interest rate agreements are recognized through the income statement 
we use interest rate agreements to manage our interest rate risks  and the changes in the value of the hedged asset or liability is not included in the valuation adjustment 
thus  our use of interest rate agreements accounted for as trading instruments could lead to volatile reported earnings even when they are accomplishing the goal of hedging some of our interest rate risks 
changes in fair market values of our loan purchase commitments are reflected in our income statement 
we commit to purchase certain loans and generally do not take possession of the loans for up to a month 
during that time  the value of the loan may change from our commitment purchase price and the resulting change in value is recognized through our income statement 
the table below provides the components of valuation adjustments for and table recognized valuation adjustments  net in thousands year ended december  write downs to fair market value under eitf changes in values of interest rate agreements that are accounted for as trading instruments change in value of purchase commitments recognized valuation adjustments  net other comprehensive income our real estate securities are accounted for as available for sale afs and are reported on our consolidated balance sheets at fair market value 
many of our derivative instruments are accounted for as cash flow hedges and are also reported on our consolidated balance sheets at fair market value 
the differences between the value of these assets and our amortized cost are shown as a component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
periodic changes in the fair market value of these assets relative to amortized cost are included in other comprehensive income 
there are a number of factors that affect the fair market value of our assets 
for most securities and derivative instruments  changes in interest rates can have an impact on the current value 
during  the fair market value adjustments on afs assets increased by million and the fair market value adjustments on cash flow hedges decreased by million 
taxes provisions for income taxes as a reit  we are able to pass through substantially all of our earnings generated at the reit level to stockholders without paying income tax at the corporate level 
we pay income tax on the reit taxable income we retain and on the income we earn at our taxable subsidiaries 
we provide for income taxes for gaap purposes based on our estimates of our taxable income  the amount of taxable income we plan to permanently retain  and the taxable income we estimate was earned at our taxable subsidiaries 
a portion of our income tax provision is based on current tax provisions and another portion includes changes in our deferred taxes arising from timing differences between our gaap and taxable income recognition 
our income tax provision in was million  a decrease from the million income tax provision recorded in  primarily due to a decline in net income 
taxable income and dividends during  we earned an estimated million of total taxable income 
of this amount  million was earned at the reit and million was earned at our taxable subsidiaries 
total taxable income is not a measure calculated in accordance with gaap 
it is the pre tax income calculated for tax purposes 
estimated reit taxable income is an important measure as it is the basis of our required dividend distributions to shareholders 
reit taxable income is that portion of our taxable income that we earn in our parent reit company and its reit subsidiaries 
it does not include taxable income earned in taxable subsidiaries 
as in the past few years  in we intend to permanently retain of our taxable reit income and defer a portion to distribute to shareholders in the subsequent year 
in  we declared four regular quarterly dividends of per share and a special dividend of per share 
these dividends completed the distribution of our reit taxable income and included the distribution of a part of our reit taxable income 
all of the dividends were distributions of ordinary income there were no capital gains distributed and there was no return of capital 
at december   there was million per share of estimated reit taxable income still undistributed that we will distribute to our shareholders during we currently anticipate following our historical pattern of retention of taxable income and distribution of dividends in our board of directors currently has indicated its intent ion to increase the regular quarterly dividend to per share in taxable income calculations differ from gaap income calculations in a variety of ways 
the most significant differences include the timing of amortization of premium and discounts and the timing of the recognition of gains or losses on assets 
the rules for both gaap and tax accounting for loans and securities are technical and complicated  and the impact of changing interest rates  actual and projected prepayment rates  and actual and projected credit losses can have a very different impact on the amount of gaap and tax income recognized in any one period 
see the discussions under potential gaap earnings volatility and potential tax earnings volatility below 
the table below reconciles gaap income to total taxable income for and for the most part  the assets and liabilities of the securitization entities we sponsor are not consolidated for tax purposes as they are for gaap purposes because the securitized assets are owned by independent securitization entities and the abs issued liabilities are obligations of those entities 
thus  the associated income and expense of most securitized assets and liabilities are not included in our income for tax purposes  and there are large differences between total interest income and total interest expense for gaap and tax purposes 
for tax purposes  the income reported reflects those assets owned by the reit or its taxable subsidiaries but not assets owned by the securitization entities  and the expense reflects interest expense on debt but does not include the interest on the liabilities of the securitization entities 
table differences between gaap net income and total taxable income in thousands  except per share data gaap differences taxable gaap differences taxable interest income interest expense junior subordinated notes net interest income operating expenses realized gains on sales and calls valuation adjustments provision for income taxes net income shares used for eps calculations earnings per share total taxable income per share is computed on a quarterly basis by dividing the estimated pretax total taxable income earned in the calendar quarter by the number of shares outstanding at the end of the quarter 
total taxable income per share for the year is the sum of the four quarters total taxable income per share 
total taxable income in of million per share decreased from the million per share earned in one reason for this decrease was a reduction in gains on sales and calls of assets 
for tax purposes  we realized million of gains in  a decrease from the million of gains realized in another reason was the increase in operating expense in of million  which was primarily the result of the timing of the exercise of stock options and the distributions of other equity awards 
operating expenses increased as well due to increases in staffing in partially offsetting the decrease in net gains and the increase in operating expense was a million increase in net interest income as calculated for tax purposes in continued strong credit performance  fast prepayments  and rising short term interest rates all contributed to increased net yields on our portfolios 
for tax purposes  our yields on our residential  commercial  and cdo ces are higher than for gaap  primarily due to the difference in timing of amortizing the discount into income 
in  we amortized million more discount into income on our ces portfolios for tax purposes than for gaap purposes 
as a result  at december  the tax basis of our residential  commercial  and cdo ces was million higher than the gaap basis 
the other contributor to the increase in net interest income as calculated for tax was tax accounting for ios 
given the fast prepayments on the underlying loans in  the yield we would currently recognize on these ios would be negative if accounted for based on economics 
for tax purposes  however  we cannot recognize a negative yield  and  thus  we are not amortizing the premium on these ios as quickly as the fast prepayments would indicate 
we are recognizing a zero yield for tax  not a negative yield as would otherwise be indicated 
as a result  our taxable income in was higher by million than it would have been otherwise cumulatively the difference is million 
our taxable income over the next few years will be lower than it would have been otherwise by this same amount 
see the discussion of sequoia ios under potential tax earnings volatility below 
we continue to be in compliance with reit tests 
we generally attempt to avoid acquiring assets or structuring financings or sales at the reit that could generate unrelated business taxable income or excess inclusion income that would be distributed to our shareholders or that would cause prohibited transaction taxes on the reit 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
potential gaap earnings volatility we expect quarter to quarter gaap earnings volatility for a variety of reasons  including the timing of sales and calls of assets  changes in interest rates  prepayments  credit losses  and capital utilization 
in addition  volatility may occur because of technical accounting issues  some of which are described below 
loan premium our unamortized loan premium on our consolidated residential loans at december  was million 
this will be expensed over the remaining life of these loans 
this represents a gaap cost basis of of par value on the billion of principal underlying these loans 
the premium balance for these loans has not been amortized over time as quickly as these loans have prepaid 
as a consequence  our reported earnings have been higher than they would have been if  for example  the proportion of total premium amortized equaled the proportion of total principal prepaid on loans 
amortization for a significant portion of this premium balance is driven by effective yield calculations that depend on interest rates and prepayments see critical accounting policies for further details 
loan premium amortization was million in and million in declines in short term interest rates could cause a significant inc rease in required amortization in subsequent periods 
in addition  premium amortization expense acceleration could occur if we reclassify a portion of the underlying loans from held for investment to held for sale  as the gaap carrying value of these loans are currently in excess of their fair market value 
this reclassification could occur as the various underlying pools of loans become callable and we decide to sell these loans  or it could occur if there is a change in accounting principles 
real estate securities currently  all of our real estate securities are classified as available for sale afs and are carried on our balance sheets at their estimated fair market value 
cumulative unrealized market value gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
however  adverse changes to projected cash flows related to poor credit performance or adverse changes to prepayment speeds could create an other than temporary impairment for accounting purposes and could cause fair market value losses  if any  to be reported through our income statement 
earnings volatility related to real estate securities may also occur if we changed the gaap classification for existing securities from afs to trading or if we use trading accounting for new securities acquired 
changes in the fair market value of trading securities are required to flow through our income statement 
derivative instruments currently we have two classifications for derivative instruments  trading and cash flow hedges 
all derivative instruments  regardless of classification  are reported on our consolidated balance sheets at fair market value 
changes to the fair market value of the derivatives classified as trading instruments are recognized through the consolidated statements of income 
for those derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges  the changes in fair market values  are reported through our consolidated balance sheets with only the ineffective portions as determined according to the accounting provisions reported through our income statement 
we could experience significant earnings volatility from our use of derivatives 
this could occur  for example  when the recognition in changes in the fair market value of the derivatives are reported through our income statement and changes in the fair market value in the hedged asset or liability are not recognized through our income statement 
potential tax earnings volatility taxable income may vary from quarter to quarter based on the timing for tax purposes of transactions and events  or based on the application of technical regulations 
this could occur for many reasons  three of which are discussed below 
ces and loans we are not permitted for tax purposes to anticipate  or reserve for  credit losses 
taxable income can only be reduced by actual losses 
as a consequence  we are required to accrete the entire purchase discount on ces into taxable income over their expected life 
for gaap purposes  we do anticipate credit losses and thus only accrete a portion of the ces discount into income 
as a result  our income recognition on ces is faster for tax as compared to gaap  especially in the early years of owning the assets when there are generally few credit losses 
at december   the cumulative difference between the gaap and tax amortized costs basis of our residential  commercial  and cdo ces was million 
in addition  as of december   we had a credit reserve of million for gaap on our residential and commercial loans  and none for tax 
as we have no credit reserves for tax and a higher ces basis  any future credit loss es on our ces or loans would have a more significant impact on tax earnings as compared to gaap and may create significant taxable income volatility to the extent the level of credit losses varies during periods 
sequoia interest only certificates ios as a result of rapid prepayments  we are experiencing negative economic returns on some ios we acquired from prior sequoia securitizations 
for tax purposes  however  we are not permitted to recognize a negative yield  so premium amortization expenses for tax have not been as high as they otherwise could have been 
as a result  our current tax basis on these ios are higher than the fair market values 
we expect to call most sequoia securitization entities over the next two years  at which time the remaining io tax basis will be written off and a capital loss for tax created 
capital losses do not reduce ordinary income or our requirement to distribute ordinary income as dividends 
capital losses do offset capital gains realized from sales or calls of assets  and thus will reduce future distributions of these capital gains 
our taxable earnings will vary from period to period based on the exact timing of these sequoia call s 
compensation compensation expense for tax varies depending on the timing of dividend equivalent rights payments  the exercise of stock options  the distribution of deferred stock units  and deferrals to and withdrawals from our executive deferred compensation plan 
as compared to our analysis of as compared to has been revised from what was previously reported to reclassify assets and expenses in the manner reflected in the financial statement presentation 
these reclassifications  which are outlined below  did not impact our reported net income for or due diligence expenses are costs for services related to re underwriting and analyzing loans we acquire or loans we credit enhance through the purchase of securities 
beginning in the second quarter of  we recognized these due diligence expenses as an operating expense rather than a reduction in interest income  and amounts that were recorded in and as a reduction in interest income have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
this reclassification has resulted in an increase to interest income and yield by portfolio for the years presented 
the amounts reclassified in and between net interest income and operating expenses was million and million  respectively 
for  our commercial ces includes all below investment grade securities rather than just the first loss securities that comprised this classification in prior years 
there has therefore been a reclassification between the commercial ces and securities portfolios for interest income and average balances as compared to those previously reported for and acquisitions  securitizations  sales  and calls during  we acquired million residential loan ces 
this was similar to the million we acquired in the loans underlying the ces we acquired during were generally of above average quality as compared to securitized residential loans as a whole 
in  we had calls of our residential loan ces of million principal value for gaap gains of million 
this was a decrease from the calls realized in of million principal value that generated gaap gains of million 
we had fewer of these assets become callable during at the end of  we had residential loan ces securities with principal value totaling million that were callable 
during  we sold million residential loan ces generating gaap gains of million 
during  sales of residential loan ces totaled million generating gaap gains of million 
sales in where higher due to our portfolio restructuring activities 
we acquired million commercial real estate loans during  a decrease from the million acquired during we sold million commercial real estate loans during and million during our commercial real estate loan activity provides additional collateral to the acacia cdo securitizations we sponsor 
during  we acquired million commercial loan ces  a significant increase from the million acquired in this increase reflects our ongoing efforts to increase our ability to analyze  source  and manage commercial real estate loan ces 
no commercial loan ces were sold during these periods 
in  our residential real estate loan acquisitions totaled billion 
we sold billion of these loans to sequoia entities and also sold million loans as whole loans to others  leaving us with an inventory of loans of million at december  sequoia entities issued billion asset backed securities abs during this level of residential loan securitization activity was a significant decrease from when sequoia entities acquired loans of billion and issued a like amount of abs 
typically we acquire london inter bank offer rate libor adjustable rate mortgage arm residential loans for the sequoia securitization program we sponsor  the flatter yield curve reduced the amount of libor arm residential loans originated in we acquired million of other residential and commercial real estate securities during as inventory for sale to our acacia cdo securitization program 
this was an increase from the million of these acquisitions we made for acacia during we sold securities to acacia entities totaling million during and million during at december   we had securities of million for sale to future acacias entities 
in both and  acacia entities issued million cdo abs 
net income our reported gaap net income was million per share for  a decrease from the million per share earned in our gaap return on equity was for compared to for the reduction in our net income of million from to resulted from a decrease in net interest income of million  an increase in operating expenses of million  an increase in provisions for income taxes of million  partially offset by an increase in net gains on sales and calls net of market valuation adjustments of million 
net interest income net interest income decreased to million in compared to million in the reduction in net interest income of million resulted from increased arm prepayment rates on residential loans consolidated from sequoia securitization entities and lower yields on our portfolio of residential ces as our older higher yielding securities were called or sold  and from higher levels of unvested cash 
in addition  net interest income was higher in due to the effect of a cumulative correcting adjustment of an error on previously reported earnings of million 
net interest income in benefited from a reduction in credit provision expenses of million as a result of excellent loan credit performance and reduced loan balances as prepayments for loans owned by sequoia accelerated while sequoia securitization volume dropped 
prepayment rates cpr for residential arm loans owned by sequoia entities increased from an average of in to in faster prepayments on arms have been caused primarily by the flatter yield curve higher than average short term interest rates relative to long term interest rates and the increase in popularity of negative amortization loans 
borrowers are more inclined to refinance out of arms and into hybrid or fixed rate loans when the effective interest rates on arms are not significantly lower than the fixed rate alternatives 
additionally  new forms of adjustable rate mortgages negative amortization  option arms  and moving treasury average arms represent an increased share of the arm market and have increased arm to arm refinancing 
these faster prepayment rates for consolidated arm loans had a negative impact on our net interest income in however  in the long term we believe we will likely benefit from faster residential loan prepayments due to our significant investment in discount priced residential loan ces 
interest income total interest income consists of interest earned on consolidated earning assets  plus income from amortization of discount for assets acquired at prices below principal value  less expenses for amortization of premium for assets acquired at prices above principal value  less credit provision expenses on loans 
table interest income and yield dollars in thousands interest income discount amortization premium amortization reversal of provision for credit losses total interest income average earning assets yield as a result of interest income discount amortization premium amortization reversal of provision for credit losses yield on earning assets interest income increased to million in from million in primarily due to an overall increase in yield caused by an increase in short term interest rates 
since a majority of the assets on our consolidated balance sheets are adjustable rate residential real estate loans  yields on these loans increase as short term interest rates rise 
as a result  total interest income was higher  even though the residential real estate loans consolidated balances decreased slightly from the prior year s level 
in addition to the impact of higher short term interest rates  the contribution from the other portfolios increased in  also leading to higher interest income

almost all these loans have coupon rates that adjust monthly or every six months based on the one or six month libor interest rate 
yields on these residential real estate loans increased as short term interest rates rose 
the average balance decreased as loan prepayments exceeded new acquisitions 
higher premium amortization expenses as a percentage of current loan balances in were caused primarily by increasing prepayment rates on these loans 
table residential loan credit enhancement securities interest income and yield dollars in thousands interest income net discount amortization total interest income average residential loan credit enhancement securities yield as a result of interest income net discount amortization yield interest income recognized from residential loan ces increased primarily due to growth in our portfolio over the past year  partially offset by lower yields 
portfolio growth reflected our ability to find new assets at a pace in excess of our sales  calls  and principal prepayments 
yields decreased as many of our more seasoned  higher yielding assets higher yielding as a result of several years of strong credit performance and favorable prepayments were called or sold over the last few years 
the more recently acquired residential loan ces generally are being carried at lower effective yields because we do not expect the same strong credit performance or favorable prepayment patterns as we have experienced in the past  and because on average we acquired these assets at higher prices than in the past 
the yields we currently recognize on recently acquired residential loan ces may be less than the yields we will actually realize over the lives of these residential loan ces 
to determine yields on residential loan ces  we make assumptions regarding loan losses and prepayments 
since the market generally has a wide range for these assumptions and not a specific estimate  we apply assumptions within a range that generally results in yields on these assets in early periods of ownership that are lower than what we might realize over the life of the assets if future performance turns out to be better than the low range of our expectations 
specifically  the initial yield we book on certain residential loan ces may be lower than the market mid range expectation of performance and below our hurdle rate of pre tax and pre overhead internal rate of return 
we review the actual performance of each residential loan ces and the market  s and our renewed range of expectations every quarter 
we adjust the yield of the assets as a result of supportable changes in market conditions and anticipated performance 
in addition  to the extent we credit enhance loans with special credit risk eg  negative amortization loans  we may not recognize interest income that is not paid 
we make ongoing determinations of the likelihood that any deferred interest payments will be collectible in recognizing current period yields

this increase was partially offset by lower yields on newer commercial loan ces 
the yield on commercial loan ces is based on our projected cash flows over time 
although we acquire commercial loan ces at a discount  we designate the amount of credit protection based on the anticipated losses in the underlying pool of loans 
since these commercial loan ces are the first loss pieces  the amount of credit protection so designated results in a premium balance to be amortized over the remaining lives of the assets 
over time  if the loans underlying these commercial loan ces perform better than we expect  we would re designate a portion of the credit protection to accretable discount  thereby reducing the unamortized premium balance and increasing the yield recognized on these assets 
table consolidated securities portfolio interest income and yield dollars in thousands interest income discount amortization total interest income average securities portfolio balance yield as a result of interest income discount amortization yield total interest income increased for the securities portfolio as the total size of the portfolio grew and as yields increased as the coupon rates on adjustable rate loan securities which comprise over half of the portfolio adjusted upward with the increase in short term interest rates 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest payments on redwood debt and consolidated abs issued from sponsored securitization entities  plus amortization of deferred abs issuance costs and expenses related to certain interest rate agreements less the amortization of abs issuance premiums 
abs issuance premiums are created when interest only securities and other abs are issued at prices greater than principal value 
total consolidated interest expense increased as a result of a higher cost of funds due to an increase in short term interest rates as most of our debt and consolidated abs issued is indexed to one  three  or six month libor 
the average balance of debt and consolidated abs issued outstanding was at similar levels during these years

operating expenses total operating expenses increased by from to due to investments in systems and infrastructure  increases in the scale of our operations  increased excise taxes  and increased accounting  consulting fees  and internal control costs 
generally  the scale of our business over the last few years has increased more rapidly than our operating expenses 
our operating costs continue to increase in part because of increased personnel needs resulting from both prior and anticipated growth 
the reconciliation of gaap operating expense to operating expense before excise tax and variable stock option income or expense is provided in the table below 
table operating expenses dollars in thousands total operating expenses less excise tax less variable stock option income expense vsoi vsoe total operating expenses before excise tax and vsoe vsoi components of total operating expense before excise tax and vsoe vsoi fixed compensation expense other operating expense incentive stock expense variable compensation expense total operating expenses before excise tax and vsoe vsoi net interest income nii adjusted efficiency ratio operating expense before excise tax and vsoe vsoi net interest income our operating efficiency ratio was higher in than in due to continued growth in systems and infrastructure at a time when we were selling assets 
we exclude excise tax and variable option expense or income vsoe vsoi in determining the efficiency ratio 
by excluding these items  management believes that we are providing a performance measure comparable to measures commonly used by other companies in our industry because these two types of excluded expenses do not reflect ongoing costs of day to day operations of our company 
stock option grant expenses under fas  however  are an on going expense and are included in operating expense before excise tax and vsoe vsoi 
excise tax is a function of the timing of dividend distributions 
in years which we delay distributing dividends on a portion of our reit taxable income  under the reit tax rules  we may pay excise taxes on a portion of this delayed distribution 
excise tax is included in operating expenses on our consolidated statements of income 
vsoe vsoi is a non cash expense or income item that varies as a function of redwood s stock price 
if our stock price increases during a quarter and the stock price is above the exercise price of certain variable options  we record a gaap expense in that period equal to the increase in the stock price times the number of in the money variable options that remain outstanding 
if our stock price decreases during a quarter  we record income in that period equal to the decrease in the stock price times the number of in the money variable options that remain outstanding 
with the adoption of financial accounting statement no 
r  share based payment fas r  effective january   we will not have vsoe vsoi  in future periods 
fixed compensation expenses include employee salaries and related employee benefits 
other operating expenses include office costs  systems  legal and accounting fees  and other business expenses 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in expanding our staff and developing our business processes and information technologies in order to meet the operating needs we will face as we grow in the long term 
as a result  we expect these fixed and other operating expenses will continue to increase 
incentive stock income expense represents the cost of equity compensation as determined under fas for options and option equity awards granted to employees and directors after december  beginning january   with the adoption of fas r  all remaining unvested incentive awards and all future awards will be accounted for under this principle 
beginning january   there will no longer be dividend equivalent right der expenses for gaap purposes as all remaining stock awards will be accounted for under fas r and the value of additional ders on an award is already included in the value at the time of grant and is expensed over the requisite service period of the award 
variable compensation includes employee bonuses which are based on individual employee performance and the adjusted return on equity earned by redwood and der expenses on certain options still outstanding and granted prior to december  the primary drivers of this expense are the profitability return on equity of redwood  taxable income at the reit which determines total dividend distribution requirements  the number of employees  and the number of incentive stock awards outstanding that receive der payments that are expensed options granted prior to january  
net recognized gains losses and valuation adjustments for  our net recognized gains and valuation adjustments totaled million as compared to million for realized gains due to calls were significantly less in at million than in at million as we had fewer securities that had reached their call factor 
gains in sales we initiated as part of our portfolio restructuring were greater in at million than in at million 
accounting rules fas  eitf  and sab m require us to review the projected discounted cash flows on certain of our assets based on credit  prepayment  and other assumptions  and to mark to market through our income statement those assets that have experienced any deterioration in discounted projected cash flows as compared to the previous projection that could indicate permanent impairment as defined by gaap 
assets with reduced discounted projected cash flows are written down in value through a non cash income statement charge if the current fair market value for that asset is below our current basis 
if the market value is above our basis  our basis remains unchanged and there is no gain recognized in income 
it is difficult to predict the timing or magnitude of these adjustments  the quarterly adjustment could be substantial 
under the accounting rules fas  eitf  and sab m  we recognized other than temporary impairments of million for and million for some of our interest rate agreements are accounted for as trading instruments  and in  we de designated one agreement as such as part of our call of an acacia securitization 
as a result  we recognized gains of million in and losses of million in on these interest rate agreements 
provisions for income taxes as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our reit taxable income each year 
therefore  we generally pass through substantially all of our earnings to stockholders without paying federal income tax at the corporate level 
we pay income tax on this income and the income we earn at our taxable subsidiaries 
taxable income calculations differ from gaap income calculations 
we provide for income taxes for gaap purposes based on our estimates of our taxable income  the amount of taxable income we permanently retain  and the taxable income we estimate was earned at our taxable subsidiaries 
our income tax provision in was million  an increase from the million income tax provision taken in in  our income tax provision under gaap benefited slightly from state net operating losses 
in  we were able to use state and federal net operating losses to reduce our tax liability 
in addition  in  we recognized a reversal of previously existing valuation allowances related to net operating losses nols  thus recognizing the future value of remaining net operating losses at that time 
furthermore  in we generated taxable gains on sales from our securitization activities at the taxable subsidiaries 
gains on these activities were much lower in due to decreased volumes and a significant decrease in the gains generated by each securitization 
since these securitizations were treated as financings under gaap  deferred tax assets were created 
the deferred tax assets are amortized through the deferred tax provision as the related gaap income is recognized 
taxable income and dividends total taxable income is not a measure calculated in accordance with gaap 
it is the pre tax income calculated for tax purposes 
estimated total taxable income is an important measure as it is the basis of our dividend distributions to shareholders 
taxable income calculations differ significantly from gaap income calculations 
reit taxable income is that portion of our taxable income that we earn in our parent company and reit subsidiaries 
it does not include taxable income earned in taxable non reit subsidiaries 
we must distribute at least of reit taxable income as dividends to shareholders over time 
as a reit we are not subject to corporate income taxes on the reit taxable income we distribute 
the remainder of our taxable income is income we earn in taxable subsidiaries 
we pay income tax on this income and we generally retain the after tax income at the subsidiary level 
we also pay income tax on the reit taxable incom e we retain we can retain up to of the total 
the table below reconciles gaap net income to total taxable income and reit taxable income for and table differences between gaap net income and total taxable and reit taxable income in thousands  except per share data actual actual gaap net income gaap tax differences in accounting for interest income and interest expense credit losses operating expenses gains losses and valuation adjustments provisions for taxes total taxable income pre tax earnings from taxable subsidiaries reit taxable income pre tax gaap net income per share total taxable income per share reit taxable income per share total taxable income per share and reit taxable income per share are measured as  respectively  the estimated pretax total taxable income and reit taxable income earned in a calendar quarter divided by the number of shares outstanding at the end of that quarter 
annual total taxable income per share and annual reit taxable income per share are  respectively  the sum of the four quarterly total taxable income per share and reit taxable income per share calculations 
total taxable income and total taxable income per share decreased in from the primary reason for this was decreased levels of capital invested in assets not only ces but also io and other securities  and fewer gains on sales on securitizations at the taxable subsidiaries as a result of lower volume of securitizations and less gain per transaction 
in addition  the current yield we report for tax purposes on our new assets is much higher than the yield we report for gaap purposes 
this is true for those assets that have concentrated credit risk as  for tax purposes  credit losses are not anticipated but rather are only expensed as incurred 
it is also true for other assets as  due to fast prepayments  some premium amortization expense for tax purposes has been delayed because we cannot recognize a negative yield for tax purposes on interest only securities  this delayed premium amortization expense will likely impac t the taxable gain or loss on sale or call in a future period 
dividends to stockholders during totaled million  approximately million of which represented the distribution of the balance of reit taxable income earned in based on our estimates of reit taxable income  we will enter with million of undistributed reit taxable income which we will pay as dividends to our stockholders during we currently project that most of the first three regular quarterly dividends we pay in will consist of reit taxable income earned in our estimates of total taxable income and reit taxable income are subject to change due to changes in interest rates and other market factors as well as changes in applicable income tax laws and regulations 
during  a portion of taxable income was in the form of net capital gains resulting from the sales and calls of some of our residential loan ces 
our income from this activity was long term capital gain income for tax purposes 
thus  during  of our dividends distributed were characterized as a distribution of long term capital gain income and the remaining was characterized as a distribution of ordinary income 
our tax paying stockholders may benefit to the degree they can take advantage of the lower tax rate on capital gains versus ordinary income 
as of december   we had met all of the dividend distribution requirements of a reit 
we generally attempt to avoid acquiring assets or structuring financings or sales at the reit level that would be likely to generate distributions of unrelated business taxable income ubti or excess inclusion income to our stockholders  or that would cause prohibited transaction taxes on the reit  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources assets below we discuss our business of investing in  financing  and managing real estate loans and securities in each of our earnings asset portfolios 
residential real estate loans we acquire high quality residential real estate loans on a bulk or flow basis from major originators 
prior to  these loan purchases were predominately short reset libor indexed arms libor arms 
generally  we financed the acquisition of these loans through our sequoia securitization program 
in  we expanded our residential conduit s product offerings to include high quality hybrid loans loans with a fixed rate coupon for a period of two to ten years before becoming adjustable 
hybrids represented of our loan acquisitions in the following table provides detail of the activity for and table residential real estate loans activity in thousands residential real estate loans at beginning of period acquisitions sales recognized gains on sales  net principal repayments transfers to reo premium amortization reversal of credit provision residential real estate loans at end of period the residential real estate loans carried on our consolidated balance sheets have declined from billion at december  to billion at december  the reason for the significant decline in the loan balance is due to the high level of prepayments on libor arm loans 
our december  residential loan balance of billion includes billion that was funded via securitization and billion of loans that are financed with equity and redwood debt 
in  we will either securitize these loans through our sequoia program  sell these loans to a third party  or continue to hold these loans funded with redwood debt to earn an interest spread 
our decision will ultimately depend on a number of factors including our level of excess cash and the availability of attractive alternative investment opportunities 
residential ces the largest part of our business in terms of capital employed is investing in residential ces 
these securities have credit ratings that are below investment grade 
due to the large amount of underlying loans  these credit enhancement assets have concentrated credit risks  and both the upside opportunities and downside risks that could come from taking on concentrated risks 
our residential ces was million at year end and million at year end  a growth rate of during the following table provides detail of the activity for each of those years

prime securities are residential mortgage backed securities backed primarily by high credit quality loans 
many of the loans are jumbos  with loan balances greater than conforming loan limits 
prime securities typically have relatively high weighted average fico scores or higher  low weighted average loan to value ratios ltv or less  and limited concentrations of investor properties 
alt a securities are residential mortgage backed securities that have higher credit quality than subprime and lower credit quality than prime 
alt a originally represented loans with alternative documentation  but has shifted over time to include loans with additional risk characteristics and a higher percentage of investor loans 
for example  borrowers income may not be verified  and in some cases  may not be disclosed on the loan application 
expanded criteria also allows for higher debt to income ratios with higher accompanying ltv than otherwise would be permissible for prime loans 
subprime securities are residential mortgage backed securities backed by loans to borrowers who have impaired credit histories  but who appear to exhibit the ability to repay the current loan 
typically  these borrowers have lower credit scores or other credit deficiencies that prevent them from qualifying for prime or alt a mortgages 
to compensate for the greater risks and higher costs to service the loans  subprime borrowers pay higher interest rates  points  and origination fees 
when evaluating the acquisition of ces backed by subprime loans  we use loss assumptions that are significantly higher than those we use for prime loans 
the following table details our and year end residential ces portfolios by the underlying loan type prime  alt a  subprime and by credit rating 
table residential ces credit rating and collateral type at december  rating in millions total bb b unrated prime alt a subprime total residential ces at december  rating in millions total bb b unrated prime alt a subprime total residential ces the loans underlying all of our residential ces totaled billion at december  of these loans  billion were prime  billion were alt a  and billion were subprime 
they are located nationwide with a large concentration in california 
they continue to perform well from a credit perspective 
during  realized residential credit losses were million of principal value  a rate that is less than one basis point on an annualized basis of the balance of loans 
serious delinquencies days  in foreclosure  in bankruptcy or reo at december  were of current balance and of original balance 
for loans in prime pools  delinquencies were of current balance and of original balance 
alt a pools had delinquencies of of current balance and of original balance 
subprime loans had delinquencies of of current balance and of o riginal balance 
as a result of the concentrated credit risk associated with residential loan ces  we are generally able to acquire these securities at a discount to their face principal value 
the difference between the principal value billion and carrying value million  which equals fair market value of these residential loan ces at december   was million 
of this difference  million was designated as internal credit reserve reflecting our estimate of credit losses on the underlying loans over the life of these securities  million represented a purchase discount we are accreting into income over time  and million represented net unrealized mark to market gains 
residential investment grade securities we invest in investment grade residential securities igs backed by prime  alt a  and subprime residential loans 
these igs are not directly exposed to first loss credit risk as they benefit from credit enhancement provided by others 
the credit performance of these assets continued to be strong during at december  and  the majority of these securities were funded through securitizations under our acacia program 
our residential investment grade securities totaled billion at year end and billion at year end the growth rate for was

we believe that this area offered attractive risk return profiles relative to other sectors 
commercial real estate loans we have invested in commercial real estate loans since at december  and  commercial real estate loans totaled million and million  respectively 
these include mezzanine loans  subordinated junior or senior lien loans  and b notes b notes represent a structured commercial real estate loan that retains a higher portion of the credit risk and generates a higher yield than the initial loan 
credit performance of our commercial loan portfolio remain strong and in line with our expectations 
the decline in the loan balance from december  to december  resulted from loan prepayments 
we acquired no commercial real estate loans during this was primarily due to increasing levels of leverage underwritten by many whole loan lenders during the year  as well as lower yield high prices for loans 
we will continue to pursue commercial real estate loans that meet our investment objectives and increase this portfolio when we feel it is appropriate 
commercial ces our total commercial ces was million at december   an increase from million at december  these credit enhancement securities bear concentrated credit risks with respect to billion underlying loans on office  retail  multifamily  industrial  and other income producing properties nationwide

we may securitize these loans or continue to fund them with debt 
to finance securities we use warehouses and repo agreements 
the acacia warehouses have limited recourse to redwood  whereas other redwood debt facilities have full recourse to us 
redwood debt is secured by pledges of our loans and securities 
the table below shows the amount of debt outstanding by facility at december  and table redwood debt by facility in thousands loans repo agreements madrona commercial paper facility securities acacia warehouses total redwood debt in the last few years  we generally used redwood debt to fund the acquisition of loans and securities on a temporary basis prior to their sale to a securitization entity 
we are now acquiring assets as a longer term investment that we intend to fund on an ongoing basis with redwood debt 
this accounts for most of the increase in redwood debt during the amount of debt we use to fund assets is determined on an asset by asset basis by our internal policies on average we expect to allocate equity under our risk management policies for debt funded assets 
asset backed securities issued redwood has securitized the majority of the assets shown on its consolidated balance sheets 
in a securitization  redwood sells assets to a securitization entity that creates and sells asset backed securities abs in order to fund its asset purchases 
the residential whole loan securitization entities redwood sponsors are called sequoia and the cdo securitization entities redwood sponsors are called acacia 
these securitization entities are bankruptcy remote from redwood  so that redwood s liabilities cannot become liabilities of the securitization entity and the abs issued by the securitization entity cannot become obligations of redwood trust 
nevertheless  since  according to accounting definitions  we control these securitization entities  we show both the assets and liabilities of these entities on our consolidated balance sheets 
at december   our consolidated balance sheets included billion of assets ow ned by the securitization entities of total consolidated assets and included billion of liabilities of the securitization entities of total consolidated liabilities 
generally  when we securitize assets  as opposed to owning them directly and funding them with redwood debt and equity  our reported cost of funds is higher the cost of abs securities issued is generally higher than that of our debt but we utilize less equity capital 
as a result  our return on equity may increase after securitization 
in addition  liquidity risks are generally reduced or eliminated  as the redwood debt associated with the accumulation of these assets during their accumulation is paid off following securitization

these trust preferred securities require quarterly distributions at a floating rate equal to libor plus until they are redeemed in whole  or mature on january  the earliest optional redemption date without a penalty is january  in our internal risk adjusted capital calculations  we consider these trust preferred securities as part of our capital base 
interest rate agreements we generally use interest rate agreements to reduce the potential volatility of our earnings as interest rates change 
we enter into these agreements with highly rated counterparties and maintain certain risk management policies limiting our exposure concentrations to any counterparty 
at december   we were party to interest rate agreements with an aggregate notional value of billion and a net fair market value of million 
at december   we were party to interest rate agreements with an aggregate notional value of billion and a net fair market value of million 
stockholders equity our reported book value at december  was per share  an increase from per share at the beginning of the year 
our book value per share increased this year as a result of retained earnings  increases in the net fair market value of our assets and interest rate agreements  and accretive stock issuance 
we issue equity only when we believe equity growth will enhance long term earnings and dividends per share  compared to what they would have been otherwise 
given the amount and quality of the asset acquisition opportunities we anticipate seeing  we currently expect to seek additional equity and or long term debt capital during cash requirements  sources of cash  and liquidity we use cash to fund our operations and securitization activities  invest in earning assets  service and repay redwood debt  fund working capital  and fund our dividend distributions 
one primary source of cash is principal and interest payments received on a monthly basis from real estate loans and securities 
other sources of cash include proceeds from sales of assets to securitizations entities  proceeds from sales of other assets  proceeds from calls of securities  borrowings  and issuance of equity and debt 
cash flows generated and used within consolidated abs securitization entities are not directly available to redwood  although they are shown on our consolidated statement of cash flows 
we own the call rights for many of these securitization entities  generally allowing us  when certain targets or dates have been met  to pay off the abs liabilities of these entities and acquire their assets at par 
we generally use capital  rather than securitization proceeds or redwood debt  to fund investments in assets that have highly concentrated credit risks  including residential ces  commercial ces  and cdo ces and similar illiquid assets 
for the acquisition of assets with less credit sensitivity  we employ leverage and the capital component is much lower  generally from to 
we use structured leverage through sequoia and acacia  which is non recourse to us  or redwood debt 
during  we raised million new equity capital through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan dspp and received million in proceeds from the sale of trust preferred securities 
additionally  we freed up capital by selling million of some of our riskiest residential ces and by recycling million of capital by securitizing certain second loss residential ces through our acacia program 
these securities were previously funded with capital 
we absorbed all of the capital we raised and freed up in primarily through acquisitions of residential whole loans  residential and commercial ces  and investment grade securities 
our excess capital balance was million at december   down from million at december  we derive our excess capital figures by calculating the amount of cash we would have available for investment if we fully leveraged our loans and securities in accordance with our internal risk capital policies and deducted from the resulting cash balances the amount needed to fund operations  working capital  and provide for certain potential liquidity risks 
for the purpose of calculating our capital base  trust preferred securities are considered capital 
we plan to increase the level of our investment activity in compared to to finance these planned investments  we expect to use a combination of redwood debt  abs issued through our sequoia and acacia securitization programs  and capital 
we believe net capital absorption will likely be between million and million 
since this amount of capital currently exceeds the amount of our excess capital  we expect to raise additional capital in the exact amount and source of that additional capital is uncertain at this time 
potential sources include sales of equity under our dspp  as well as public or private sales of common stock  trust preferred securities  or subordinated debt 
although we are optimistic that we will be able to raise the additional capital required to fund our planned increase in investments during  our ability to do so or to do so at attractive rates will depend upon capital market conditio ns and other factors 
contractual obligations and commitments the table below presents our contractual obligations and commitments as of december   as well as the obligations of the securitization entities that we sponsored and are consolidated on our balance sheets 
the operating leases are commitments that are expensed based on the terms of the related contracts 
table contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands payments due or commitment expiration by period total less than year to years to years after years redwood obligations redwood debt junior subordinated notes accrued interest payable operating leases purchase commitments total redwood obligations and commitments obligations of securitization entities consolidated asset backed securities accrued interest payable total obligations of securitization entities total consolidated obligations and commitments note all consolidated abs issued are collateralized by associated assets and  although the stated maturity is as shown except for abs called in january  the abs obligations will pay down as the principal of the associated real estate loans or securities pay down 
in december we exercised our right to call three sequoia securitizations 
these calls were completed in january and therefore the table shows this amount as becoming due in less than one year 
market risks we seek to manage the risks inherent in our business including but not limited to credit risk  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  liquidity risk  and market value risk in a prudent manner designed to enhance our earnings and dividends and preserve our capital 
in general  we seek to assume risks that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risks  and to maintain capital levels consistent with these risks 
credit risk integral to our core business is assuming the credit risk of real estate loans primarily through the ownership of residential and commercial real estate loans and securities 
much of our capital base is employed in owning credit enhancement securities that have below investment grade credit ratings due to their concentrated credit risks with respect to underlying real estate loans 
we believe that many of the loans underlying these securities are above average in credit quality as compared to us real estate loans in general  but the balance and percentage of loans with special risk factors higher risk commercial loans  interest only and negative amortization residential loan types  and alt a and subprime residential loans has increased and will likely continue to increase 
we also own a wide variety of residential and commercial real estate loans of various quality grades that are not securitized 
credit losses from any of the loans in securitized loan pools reduce the principal value of and economic returns on the lower rated securities in these pools 
credit losses on real estate loans can occur for many reasons  including poor origination practices  fraud  faulty appraisals  documentation errors  poor underwriting  legal errors  poor servicing practices  weak economic conditions  decline in the value of homes  businesses  or commercial properties  special hazards  earthquakes and other natural events  over leveraging of the borrower or on the property  reduction in market rents and occupancies and poor property management practices  changes in legal protections for lenders  reduction in personal incomes  job loss  and personal events such as divorce or health problems 
in addition  if the us economy or the housing market weakens  our credit losses could increase beyond levels that we have anticipated 
credit losses o n real estate loans can vary for reasons not related to the general economy 
the interest rate is adjustable for most of the loans securitized by securitization trusts sponsored by us and for a portion of the loans underlying residential loan ces we have acquired from securitizations sponsored by others 
accordingly  when short term interest rates rise  required monthly payments from homeowners will rise under the terms of these arms  and this may increase borrowers delinquencies and defaults 
we acquire credit enhancement securities backed by negative amortization adjustable rate loans made to residential borrowers 
some of these are prime quality loans while many are alt a quality loans 
we still expect significantly higher delinquencies and losses from these loans compared to regular amortization loans 
nevertheless  we believe these securities offer us the opportunity to generate attractive risk adjusted returns as a result of the way in which the securitizations of these riskier loan types are structured and because of attractive acquisition pricing 
although seemingly attractive  there is substantial uncertainty about the future performance of these assets 
the large majority of the commercial loans we credit enhance are fixed rate loans 
some of the loans are interest only loans 
in general  the loans are not fully amortizing and therefore require balloon payments at maturity 
we will experience credit losses on residential and commercial loans and ces 
to the extent the losses are in the amount and timing that we assumed  we believe we will earn attractive returns on our investments 
we manage our credit risks by first understanding the extent of the risk we are taking and insuring the appropriate underwriting criteria are met 
we have systems and staff in place to continually monitor the ongoing credit performance of each loan and security 
to the extent we find the credit risks on specific assets are changing adversely we will take actions including selling the assets to mitigate potential losses 
we may not always be successful in foreseeing adverse changes in credit performance or in effectively mitigating future credit losses 
in addition to residential and commercial ces  the acacia entities we also sponsor own investment grade and other securities typically rated aaa through b  and in a second loss position or better  or otherwise effectively more senior in the credit structure as compared to a first loss residential loan ces or commercial loan ces or equivalent issued by securitization entities that are sponsored by others 
generally  we do not control or influence the underwriting  servicing  management  or loss mitigation efforts with respect to these assets 
some of the securities acacia owns are backed by subprime and alt a residential loans that have substantially higher risk characteristics than prime quality loans 
these lower quality residential loans can be expected to have higher rates of delinquency and loss  and losses to acacia and thus redwood s interest in acacia could occur 
most of acacia s securities are reported as part of our consolidated securities portfolio on our consolidated balance sheets 
acacia has also acquired investment grade bb rated  and b rated residential loan securities from the sequoia securitization entities we have sponsored 
the probability of incurring a credit loss on these securities is less than the probability of loss from first loss ces as cumulative credit losses within a pool of securitized loans would have to exceed the principal value of the subordinated ces and exhaust any other credit protections before losses would be allocated to the acacia securities 
if the pools of residential and commercial loans underlying these securities were to experience poor credit results  however  these acacia securities could have their credit ratings down graded  could suffer losses in market value  or could experience principal losses 
if any of these events occurs  it would likely redu ce our returns from the acacia cdo equity securities we have acquired and may reduce our ability to sponsor acacia transactions in the future 
we also own investment grade real estate securities backed by loans of various quality grades 
these securities benefit from some credit protection  but if losses to the underlying loans are high enough  they could suffer credit rating downgrades  market value declines  or principal value losses 
interest rate risk interest rates and the shape of the yield curve can affect the cash flows and market values of our assets  liabilities  and interest rate agreements  and thus affect our earnings and reported equity 
our general strategy with respect to interest rates is to maintain an asset liability posture including hedges on a consolidated basis that assumes some interest rate risks but not to the degree that the achievement of our long term goals would likely be affected by changes in interest rates 
we are willing to accept short term volatility of earnings and changes in our reported equity while seeking to achieve attractive long term returns 
we use interest rate agreements to help us achieve our interest rate risk strategy 
we enter into these agreements to maintain a closer match between the interest rate characteristics of the assets in the securitization entities and the corresponding abs issued and between pledged assets and redwood debt 
we do not attempt to completely hedge changes in interest rates and  at times  we may have more interest rate risk than we generally want in the long term 
changes in interest rates will have an impact on the values and cash flows of our assets and corresponding liabilities 
prepayment risk we seek to maintain an asset liability posture that benefits from investments in prepayment sensitive assets while limiting the risk of adverse prepayment fluctuations to an amount that  in most circumstances  can be absorbed by our capital base while still allowing us to make regular dividend payments 
prepayments affect gaap earnings in the near term primarily through the timing of the amortization of purchase premium and discount and through triggering fair market value writedowns 
amortization income from discount assets may not necessarily offset amortization expense from premium assets  and vice versa 
variations in current and projected prepayment rates for individual assets and changes in interest rates as they affect projected coupons on arms and other assets and thus change effective yield calculations may cause net premium amortization expense or net discount amortization income to vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
in addition  the timing of premium amortization on assets may not always match the timing of the premium amortization on liabilities even when the underlying assets and liabilities are in the same securitization and paydown at the same rate 
changes in prepayment forecasts by market participants could affect the market prices for abs especially io securities sold by securitization entities  and thus could affect the profits we earn from securitized assets 
there are prepayment risks in the assets and associated liabilities consolidated on our balance sheets 
in general  discount securities such as ces benefit from faster prepayment rates on the underlying real estate loans while premium securities such as io securities benefit from slower prepayments on the underlying loans 
our largest current potential exposure to changes in prepayment rates is on short term residential arm loans 
we are currently biased in favor of faster prepayment speeds with respect to the long term economic effect of arm prepayments 
however  in the short term  for gaap  increases in arm prepayment rates could cause negative gaap earnings volatility 
through our ownership of discount residential loan ces backed by fixed rate and hybrid residential loans  overall we generally benefit from faster prepayments on fixed and hybrid loans 
prepayment rates for these loans typically accelerate as medium and long term interest rates decline 
prepayments can also affect our credit results and risks 
credit risks for the ces we own are reduced each time a loan prepays 
all other factors being equal  faster prepayment rates should reduce our credit risks on our existing portfolio 
prepayment rates are difficult to predict or anticipate  and variations in prepayment rates can materially affect our earnings and dividends 
for example  arm prepayment rates are driven by many factors  one of which is the steepness of the yield curve 
as the yield curve flattens short term interest rates rise relative to longer term interest rates  arm prepayments typically increase 
we do not believe it is possible or desirable to control the effects of prepayments in the short term 
thus our general approach is to seek to balance overall characteristics of our balance sheets so that the net present values of cash flows generated over the life of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated portfolios do not materially change as prepayment rates change 
market value and liquidity risks our consolidated real estate loans are accounted for as held for investment and reported at amortized cost 
most of these loans have been sold to sequoia entities and  thus  changes in the market value of the loans do not have an impact on our liquidity 
however  changes in fair market values during the accumulation period while these loans are funded with redwood debt before they are sold to a sequoia entity may have a short term effect on our liquidity 
the consolidated securities are accounted for as available for sale and are generally marked to market through our balance sheets and not through our income statement 
some of these assets are credit sensitive  and all are interest rate sensitive 
fair market value fluctuations of these assets can affect reported stockholders equity 
most of these securities are owned by securitization entities we sponsor and market value fluctuations on these securities do not have an impact on our liquidity 
fair market value fluctuations on securities we own and fund with short term debt generally prior to securitization could have an impact on our liquidity 
our earnings could be affected by adverse changes in market values on all securities we own or consolidate to the extent there is an accompanying adverse change in projected cash flows 
in these cases  the negative changes in fair market values are reported through our income stat ement 
our consolidated obligations consist primarily of abs issued 
these are reported at amortized cost 
generally  changes in market value of abs issued have no impact on our liquidity 
however  because many of our consolidated assets funded with abs issued are reported at market value  the resulting reported net equity may not necessarily reflect the true net fair market value of assets and liabilities in these securitization entities 
increasingly  we are holding debt funded assets for longer terms as an ongoing investment 
that is  we are increasing the level of loans and securities funded with debt that is recourse to redwood 
this will increase our market value and liquidity risks 
we manage these risks by maintaining what we believe to be conservative capital levels under our internal risk adjusted capital and risk management policies and by ensuring we have a variety of financing facilities available to fund each of our assets 
inflation risk virtually all of our consolidated assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
our activities and balance sheets are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the critical accounting policies and the possible effect of changes in estimates on our financial results and statements are discussed below 
management discusses the ongoing development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition when recognizing revenue on consolidated earning assets  we employ the effective yield method and use assumptions about the future to determine an effective yield that drives amortization of premiums  discounts  and other net capitalized fees and costs associated with purchasing and financing real estate loans and securities 
loan premium amortization for consolidated real estate loans  the effective yield method is applied as prescribed under fas for loans acquired prior to july  we apply the existing interest rate at the reporting date rate to determine the effective yield for each pool of loans 
during a period of rising short term rates  the coupon is projected to increase  resulting in a higher effective yield 
prior to the coupon rate resetting  generally one to six months for these loans  the amount of amortization is lower than it will be once the coupon rate resets 
thus  for the past two years  as short term rates increased  the amount of purchase premium we amortized was less than it would have been in a flat interest rate environment 
with lower premium amortization expenses as a result of rising interest rates combined with rapid prepayments  our cost bases have increased on our remaining loans 
the cost bases in these loans continues to exceed their es timated fair market values 
for loans acquired after july   we use the initial coupon interest rate of the loans without regard to future changes in the underlying indices and anticipated principal payments on a pool basis to calculate an effective yield and to amortize the premium or discount 
any volatility in amortization expense is dependent primarily on prepayments 
the cost bases of these loans are approximately equal to their fair market values 
securities discount amortization for discount amortization on our consolidated securities an effective yield is applied by projecting cash flows incorporating assumptions of credit losses  prepayment speeds  and interest rates over the remaining life of each asset 
if our assumptions prove to be accurate  then the yield that we recognize in the current period will remain the same over the life of the security 
we constantly review and update as necessary our assumptions and resulting cash flow projections based on historical performance  input and analyses received from external sources  internal models  and our own judgment and experience 
there can be no assurance that our assumptions as explained below used to generate future cash flows will prove to be accurate or that these estimates will not change materially 
the majority of our discount amortization is generated from residential and commercial ces purchased at a significant discount to par value 
discount balances equal to the credit losses that we expect to incur are set aside as a form of credit reserve and are not amortized into income 
the level of this reserve is based upon our assessment of various factors including economic conditions  characteristics and delinquency status of the underlying loans  past performance of similar loans  and other factors 
thus  when credit losses do occur  they are recorded against this reserve and there is no income statement impact at that time 
the difference between the amount of our total discount and the credit reserve is the accretable discount 
the accretable discount represents the amount of discount amortization that we expect to recognize into income over the remaining life of our assets 
as we update our estimate of future credit losse s  increases in projected losses will increase the discount set aside as reserve resulting in less accretable discount for amortization into income and lower portfolio yields 
in contrast  lower credit loss projections will increase the accretable discount balance and decrease the reserve  increasing our ces discount amortization and resulting in higher portfolio yields 
the timing of projected receipt of cash flows from our ces is also an important driver in the effective yield 
slower actual or projected prepayment speeds will cause projected receipt of cash flows to be delayed and will reduce the rate of ces discount accretion resulting in a lower yield for the portfolio 
an increase in actual or projected prepayment speeds will generally result in a higher portfolio yield as a result of increased ces discount amortization 
amortization of abs premium we apply an effective yield method in determining amortization for the sales premium and deferred asset backed securities issuance cost for abs issued 
abs sales premium will eventually be recognized through our income statement as a reduction in interest expense and the issuance cost will be amortized as additional interest expense 
similar to our securities discount amortization  the use of this method requires us to project cash flows over the remaining life of each liability 
these projections are primarily impacted by forecasted prepayment rates of the related assets 
if prepayment speeds are faster than modeled  the average life of the liability will shorten  and we will recognize the abs sales premium as an expense at a faster rate  reducing interest expense and increasing net income 
if prepayment speeds are slower than expected  the average life of the liability will lengthen  and it will take us longer to recognize the abs sales premium 
for the deferred asset backed securities issuance costs  faster prepayments will result in faster amortization and an increase in interest expense while slower prepayments will result in slower amortization and a decrease in interest expense 
other than temporary impairments increases in our credit loss assumptions or changes in projected prepayment rates could result in an adverse change in the net present value of expected cash flows 
if we have an adverse change in projected cash flows and also the market value of that asset is less than our amortized cost  we have an other than temporary impairment 
the basis of the asset is written down to fair market value through our consolidated statements of income 
fair market value write downs of this type could be substantial  reducing gaap income and causing a loss 
however  for securitized assets  reductions in fair market values may not affect our cash flows or investment returns at all  or may not affect them to the degree implied by the accounting write down 
establishing valuations and accounting for changes in valuations we report our securities at fair market value on our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that the estimates of fair market value we use reflect market values that we may be able to receive should we choose to sell assets 
our estimates are inherently subjective in nature and involve matters of uncertainty and judgment in interpreting relevant market and other data 
because we are also active acquirers  issuer of debt securities  and occasional sellers of assets  we believe that we have the ability to understand and determine changes in assumptions that are taking place in the marketplace and make appropriate changes in our assumptions for valuing assets 
however  changes in perceptions regarding future events can have a material impact on the fair market values of our assets 
should such changes occur  there could be significant decreases in the fair market values of these assets 
we estimate the fair market values using available market information and other appropriate valuation methodologies 
many assumptions are necessary to estimate fair market values  including  but not limited to  interest rates  prepayment rates  amount and timing of credit losses  supply and demand  liquidity  and other market factors 
we apply these factors to each of our assets  as appropriate  in order to determine fair market values 
our expectations of future performance are shaped by historical performance and input and analyses received from external sources  internal models  and our own judgment and experience 
in addition to our valuation processes  we use third party sources to validate our valuation estimates 
changes in the fair market value of the securities generally are reported through equity 
however  it is possible that decreases in fair market values of securities could be reported through the income statement 
see the discussion on other than temporary impairments above 
credit reserves loans held for investment for consolidated real estate loans held for investment  we establish and maintain credit reserves that we believe represent probable credit losses that will result from inherent losses existing in our consolidated real estate loans held for investment as of the date of the financial statements 
the reserves for credit losses are adjusted by taking provisions for credit losses recorded as a reduction in interest income on real estate loans on our consolidated statements of income 
the reserves consist of estimates of specific loan impairment and estimates of collective losses on pools of loans with similar characteristics 
to calculate the reserve for credit losses for real estate loans  we determine inherent losses by applying loss factors default  the timing of defaults  and the loss severity upon default that can be specifically applied to each pool of loans and estimate expected losses of each pool over their expected lives 
once we determine the loss factors  we then estimate the timing of these losses and the losses probable to occur over an effective loss confirmation period 
this period is defined as the range of time between the probable occurrence of a credit loss such as the initial deterioration of the borrower s financial condition and the confirmation of that loss the actual charge off of the loan 
we revised and shortened our estimate of this confirmation in the second quarter of the losses expected to occur within the estimated loss confirmation period are the basis of our credit reserve s because we believe those losses exist as of the reported date of the financial statements 
accounting for derivative instruments we use derivative instruments to manage certain risks such as interest rate risk and market value risks 
derivative instruments are reported on our consolidated balance sheets at their fair market value 
if a derivative instrument has a positive market value  it is reported as an asset 
if the fair market value is negative  the instrument is reported as a liability 
changes in fair market values of derivative instruments are reported either through the income statement or through our equity 
for derivatives accounted for as trading instruments  all changes in the fair market values are recognized through the income statement 
for derivatives accounted for as a cash flow hedge  most of the changes in fair market values are recorded in our balance sheet through equity 
only the ineffective portions as determined according to the accounting principle of the derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges are included in our income 
using derivatives may increase our earnings volatility as the accounting results for derivatives may not match the accounting results for the hedged asset or liability  due to our inability to or decision not to meet the requirements for certain accounting treatments  or if the derivatives do not perform as intended 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we provide a discussion about market risks in item of this annual report on form k 
to supplement these discussions  the table below incorporates information that may be useful in analyzing certain market value risks on our consolidated balance sheets 
this table presents just one scenario regarding potential future principal prepayments and interest rates of our assets and liabilities  based on certain underlying assumptions 
there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur as anticipated 
future sales  principal repayments  acquisitions  calls  and restructuring could materially change our interest rate risk profile 
for our interest rate sensitive assets  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by year of repayment 
the forward curve future interest rates as implied by the yield structure of debt markets as of december  was used to project the average coupon rates for each year presented  based on the characteristics of our existing portfolio 
the timing of principal cash flows includes assumptions on the prepayment speeds of these assets based on their recent prepayment performance and future prepayment performance consistent with the interest rate scenario 
actual prepayment speeds will likely vary from these assumptions 
furthermore  this table does not include anticipated credit losses and assumes all of the principal we are entitled to receive will be received 
the actual amount and timing of credit losses will affect the principal payments and effective rates during all periods 
our future earnings are sensitive to a number of factors and changes in these factors may have a variety of secondary effects that  in turn  will also impact our earnings 
in addition  one of the key factors in projecting our income is the reinvestment rate on new assets and there is no reinvestment assumed in this table 
the composition of our balance sheets and the set of assumptions used at december   differs slightly from those used at december   and  as a result  the presentation of the tabular information presented this year differs from a year ago 
the balance of consolidated residential loans is lower  we now consolidate hybrid loans  and the balance of consolidated securities is greater 
the assumptions we use reflect the market conditions at the date of the financial statements  so the future interest rates assumed and corresponding prepayment speeds used to project the cash flows differ from those used a year ago 
however  the overall results are similar in that our future results still depend greatly on the credit performance of the underlying loans although the tabular information assumes no credit losses  future interest rates as many of our assets are adjustable rate  prepayment behavior on residential real estat e loans  and our ability to reinvest our capital also not included in this tabular information
