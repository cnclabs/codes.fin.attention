item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we currently have a revenue sharing agreement in place that determines how much revenue we earn from swissqual sales and  conversely  how much revenue swissqual earns from our sales to customers located outside the european region 
during november  in response to increased competition in the qos market  we announced a cooperative alliance with ascom swx ascn  a leading specialist in wireless onsite communications solutions based in switzerland  to develop  market  and support next generation wireless network qos  optimization  and test measurement systems 
together we are currently developing harmonized test and measurement systems and solutions for g and g wireless standards  accelerating the availability of upgrades to the installed base in europe and our home markets  while enabling the rapid deployment of new products 
these harmonized products and solutions are expected to be available during the second half of fiscal additionally  we will share sales and support resources with ascom on a global basis and we no longer intend to establish a direct sales and support organization for our european region 
emergency call box systems we market and sell our call box systems primarily to state and local governmental agencies located in california through a direct sales force located in lake forest  california 
competition mobile power products chargesource numerous providers  including delta electronics  inc  mobility electronics  inc  targus  belkin  kensington  and apc directly compete for power product market share 
the cellular telephone and personal computer oems also serve the market for our chargesource external power adapters 
many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources 
we believe that the patents that cover our chargesource products provide us with a competitive advantage 
however  our ability to compete in these markets depends on our ability to successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  and to manufacture and deliver low cost products in sufficient volumes 
wireless test solutions the market for our hardware and software test tools is highly competitive and is served by numerous providers 
our primary competitors with respect to our wts products are agilent technologies  ascom  ericsson  andrew corporation  and spirent plc spirent  through its acquisition of swissqual 
many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources 
the wireless industry is characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions  and evolving industry standards 
to compete successfully in this market  we believe we must properly identify customer needs  price our products competitively  innovate and develop new or enhanced products  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  
table of contents manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time  and differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings 
emergency call box systems the market for our emergency call box systems is also served by numerous competitors  including us commlink  gai tronics  talk a phone  and other manufacturers of wireless and wireline emergency and information communication devices 
certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources 
key customers we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers 
mobile power products chargesource in fiscal and  kensington  our primary distributor of chargesource products  accounted for revenue totaling million and million  or percent and percent of total revenue  respectively 
in fiscal  targus  the former distributor of our mobile power products  accounted for revenue totaling million  or percent of total revenue 
wireless test solutions in fiscal and  verizon accounted for revenue totaling million and million  or percent and percent of total revenue  respectively 
in fiscal   and  swissqual  our former exclusive distributor of wts products in our european region  accounted for million  million  and million  or percent  percent  and percent of total revenue  respectively 
in fiscal  tim cellular sa  a wireless carrier based in brazil  accounted for revenue totaling million or percent of total revenue 
emergency call box systems our call box business derives a significant portion of its revenue from state and local governmental agencies 
in fiscal   and  revenue from these governmental agencies totaled million  million  and million  or percent  percent  and percent of total revenue  respectively 
the spending patterns of verizon  kensington  or any of our other key customers can vary significantly from year to year 
any significant reduction in the spending patterns of these customers could adversely affect our revenue  operating results  and cash flows 
international operations we sell our chargesource and wts products to customers located throughout the world 
in fiscal   and  we derived percent  percent  and percent of total revenue  respectively  from customers in the united states and percent  percent  and percent  respectively  from customers in foreign countries  as determined by the ship to address 
the decrease in the percentage of sales to foreign countries during fiscal as compared to fiscal and fiscal is primarily due to decreasing sales of our wts products to swissqual 
in fiscal and  there were no foreign countries from which we derived more than percent of total revenue 
in fiscal  sales to brazil accounted for million  or percent of total revenue 
research and development we sell our products in markets that are characterized by rapid technology changes  frequent new product introductions  and evolving technology standards 
accordingly  we devote significant resources to design and develop new and enhanced products that can be manufactured cost effectively and sold at competitive prices 

table of contents during fiscal   and we incurred approximately million  million  and million in research and development expenses 
to focus these efforts  we strive to maintain close relationships with our customers and develop products that meet their needs 
as of april   we had approximately engineers and other technical personnel dedicated to our research and development efforts 
generally  our research and development and other engineering efforts are managed and focused on a product by product basis  and can generally be characterized as follows we collaborate closely with our customers and partners to design and manufacture new products or modify existing products to specifications required by our customers  we design and manufacture enhancements and improvements to our existing products in response to our customers requests or feedback  and we independently design and build new products in anticipation of the needs of our customers as they transition existing wireless networks to next generation technologies 
manufacturing and suppliers we maintain one manufacturing facility located in lake forest  california  which is iso certified 
our manufacturing process involves the final assembly and test of individual components by production technicians 
the components used by us consist primarily of printed circuit boards and related assemblies  specialized subassemblies  fabricated housings and chassis  and test mobiles 
most of our components and subassemblies are manufactured by third parties to our specifications and are generally delivered to us for final assembly and test 
during fiscal  we ceased manufacturing our chargesource products in house  and transitioned all manufacturing responsibility related to these products to contract manufacturers located in china 
patents and intellectual property we hold patents that cover key technical aspects of our chargesource products 
however  we generally rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyrights  and contractual rights to protect our intellectual property embodied in the hardware and software products of our wts business 
industry practices impacting working capital existing industry practices that affect working capital and operating cash flow include the level of variability of customer orders relative to the volume of production  vendor lead times  materials availability for critical parts  inventory levels held to achieve rapid customer fulfillment  and provisions of extended payment terms to certain foreign customers 
currently  we sell our products under purchase orders that are placed with short term delivery requirements 
as a result  we periodically maintain significant levels of inventory of long lead components in order to meet our obligations 
delays in planned customer orders could result in higher inventory levels and negatively impact our operating results 
our standard terms require customers to pay for our products in us dollars 
for those orders denominated in foreign currencies  we may limit our exposure to losses from foreign currency transactions through forward foreign exchange contracts 
to date  sales denominated in foreign currencies have not been significant and we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts 
employees as of april   we employed approximately employees 
we believe our employee relations to be good 
the majority of our employees are professional or technical personnel who possess training and experience 
table of contents in engineering  computer science  and management 
our future success depends in large part on our ability to retain key technical  marketing  and management personnel  and to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly the highly skilled radio  design  process  and test engineers involved in the development of new products 
competition for such personnel can be intense  and the loss of key employees  as well as the failure to recruit and train additional technical personnel in a timely manner  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the contribution of our executive officers and other key employees 
our employee stock option plan expired during may during december  the board of directors approved and adopted a new employee equity incentive plan the plan covering  shares of our common stock 
the adoption of the plan was ratified by the company s shareholders at the annual shareholders meeting held on june  item a 
risk factors a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of our wts products to customers in the wireless communications industry 
we are currently experiencing a significant impact caused by widespread industry consolidation including substantial delays in purchasing decisions by our customers and reduced demand for our products 
if these market conditions continue  our operating results and financial condition could suffer 
revenue from the sale of our wts products accounted for percent of total revenue for fiscal wireless carriers are the primary customers for our wts products 
these customers operate in an environment driven by new technology  increased competition  and regulatory change 
to compete effectively  the wireless carriers must offer their subscribers lower prices  improved quality of service  and innovative new services 
increasing minutes of use  global subscribers  and data intensive applications are driving higher capacity utilization of existing networks  requiring wireless carriers around the globe to place a greater emphasis on capital expenditures devoted to their wireless networks 
despite this greater emphasis  current demand for our wts products has decreased compared to the prior fiscal year driven by widespread industry consolidation  delays in purchasing decisions by our customers  increased competition  and increased pricing pressure 
if these market conditions continue  our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale and maintenance of emergency call box systems and upgrades to governmental customers that have experienced severe budgetary constraints in the past 
if current and planned projects to install or upgrade call box systems are delayed  our operating results and financial condition could suffer 
revenue from the sale of upgrades and maintenance of our emergency call box systems accounted for percent of total revenue for fiscal approximately percent of our call box revenue is derived from state and local governmental agencies in california  which in prior years  experienced severe budgetary constraints 
as a result  several of our planned projects to install or upgrade call box systems were delayed 
if these adverse budgetary conditions recur  or they experience other events that result in funding constraints  we may face significant reductions in spending by our governmental customers  which would likely adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
a substantial portion of our call box revenue in fiscal was derived from non recurring upgrades of emergency call box systems to governmental customers 
if we are unable to replace this revenue stream  our operating results and financial condition could suffer 
approximately million of our fiscal call box revenue was generated from sales of digital and text telephony upgrades to our installed base of emergency call box systems 
during fiscal we expect to substantially complete the previously awarded digital and tty upgrade contracts 
we expect call box revenue for fiscal to decrease compared to fiscal 
table of contents failure to adjust our operations due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our operating results 
the spending patterns of many of our wts customers have been volatile  unpredictable  and driven by market and technological factors that we cannot control or predict 
in addition  consumer demand for our chargesource mobile power products has been subject to fluctuations as a result of our choices of distribution partners  market acceptance of our products  the timing and size of customer orders  and consumer demand for rechargeable mobile electronic devices 
accordingly  it has been difficult for us to forecast the demand for these products 
we also are limited in our ability to quickly adapt our manufacturing and related cost structures because a significant portion of our sales and marketing  design and other engineering  and manufacturing costs are fixed 
if customer demand for our wts and chargesource products declines or if we otherwise fail to accurately forecast reduced customer demand  we will likely experience excess capacity  which could adversely affect our operating results 
conversely  if market conditions improve  our manufacturing capacity may not be adequate to fill increased customer demand 
as a result  we might not be able to fulfill customer orders in a timely manner  which could adversely affect our customer relationships and operating results 
the chargesource and wts products we make are complex and have short life cycles 
if we are unable to rapidly and successfully develop and introduce new products  some of our products may become obsolete and our operating results could suffer 
the wireless communications and consumer electronics industries are characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product introductions  and evolving industry standards 
additionally  our chargesource mobile power products have short life cycles  and may become obsolete over relatively short periods of time 
our future success depends on our ability to develop  introduce  and deliver on a timely basis and in sufficient quantity new products  components  and enhancements 
the success of any new product offering will depend on several factors  including our ability to properly identify customer needs and technological trends  timely develop new technologies and applications  price our products and services competitively  timely manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volume  and differentiate our products from those of our competitors 
development of new products requires high levels of innovation from both our engineers and our component suppliers 
development of a new product often requires a substantial investment before we can determine the commercial viability of the product 
if we dedicate a significant amount of resources to the development of products that do not achieve broad market acceptance  our operating results may suffer 
our operating results may also be adversely affected due to the timing of product introductions by competitors  especially if a competitor introduces a new product before our own comparable product is ready to be introduced 
the wireless communications and consumer electronics industries are highly competitive  and our profitability will be adversely affected if we are not able to compete effectively 
the wireless communications and consumer electronics industries in which we sell our products are highly competitive in many areas  including the timing of development and introduction of new products  technology  price  quality  customer service  and support 
our competitors range from some of the respective industries largest corporations to many relatively small and highly specialized firms 
many of our competitors possess advantages over us  including greater financial and marketing resources  greater name recognition and larger and more established customer and supplier relationships 
our competitors also may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer needs 
if we do not have the resources or expertise necessary to compete or to match our competitors or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages  we could lose customers and revenue 

table of contents the average selling prices of our products may decrease over their sales cycles  especially upon the introduction of new products  which may negatively affect our revenue and operating results 
our products may experience a reduction in the average selling prices over their respective sales cycles 
further  as we introduce new or next generation products  sales prices of legacy products may decline substantially 
in order to sell products that have a falling average selling price and maintain margins at the same time  we need to continually reduce product and manufacturing costs 
there can be no assurances we will be successful in our efforts to reduce these costs 
in order to do so  we must carefully manage the price paid for components used in our products  as well as manage our inventory costs to reduce overall product costs 
if we are unable to reduce the cost of legacy products as new products are introduced  our average gross margins may decline and adversely affect our operating results 
a significant portion of our revenue is dependent in part upon our relationships with our strategic distribution partners and their performance 
if we are unable to successfully manage our relationships with the distributors of our mobile power products  our revenue and operating results could suffer 
our chargesource mobile power products are distributed by kensington  a tier one distributor of consumer electronics 
our success will depend in part upon kensington s ability and willingness to effectively and widely distribute our chargesource products on a non exclusive basis 
if kensington and our other distributors do not purchase the volume of products that we anticipate  our revenue and results of operations will suffer 
during november  in response to increased competition in the qos market  we announced a cooperative alliance with ascom  a leading specialist in wireless onsite communications solutions based in switzerland  to develop  market  and support next generation wireless network qos  optimization  and test measurement systems 
together we are currently developing harmonized test and measurement systems and solutions for g and g wireless standards  accelerating the availability of upgrades to the installed base in europe and our home markets  while enabling the rapid deployment of new products 
these harmonized products and solutions are expected to be available during the second half of fiscal additionally  the companies will share sales and support resources on a global basis 
we are unsure as to what long term effect  if any  the alliance with ascom will have on future sales of our wts products  particularly in our european region 
our success will depend in part upon our ability to jointly develop products with ascom  their ability to capture the current installed base in europe  as well as provide sales and support services in that region 
if we are unable to jointly develop and sell harmonized products  our revenue and operating results could suffer 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from a limited number of customers  and any loss of  cancellation  or delay in purchases by these customers could cause a significant decrease in our revenue 
we have historically derived a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers 
our three key customers for fiscal accounted for million  or percent of total revenue 
if any of our key customers reduces  cancels  or delays orders  and we are not able to develop other customers who purchase products at comparable levels  our revenue could decrease significantly 
in addition  any difficulty in collecting amounts due from one or more of our key customers would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a large percentage of our revenue 
we may experience quality or safety defects in our products that could cause us to institute product recalls  require us to provide replacement products and harm our reputation 
in the course of conducting our business  we experience and attempt to address various quality and safety issues with our products 
often product defects are identified during our design  development  and manufacturing processes  which we are able to correct in a timely manner 
sometimes  defects are identified after introduction and shipment of products 
if we are unable to fix defects in a timely manner or adequately address quality control issues  our relationships with our customers may be impaired  our reputation may suffer and we may lose customers 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

table of contents economic  political  and other risks associated with our international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 
we currently maintain sales and support operations in the united states  china  europe  and latin america 
our international operations accounted for approximately percent of total revenue for fiscal accordingly  our business is subject to worldwide economic and market conditions and risks generally associated with doing business abroad  such as fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates  weaknesses in the economic conditions in particular countries or regions  the stability of international monetary conditions  tariff and trade policies  domestic and foreign tax policies  foreign governmental regulations  political unrest and disruptions  and delays in shipments 
specifically  our chargesource contract manufacturer and a majority of our component suppliers are located in asia 
we do business with our foreign supply base in us dollars 
our costs increase in countries with currencies that are increasing in value against the us dollar 
also  we cannot be sure that our international supply base will continue to accept orders denominated in us dollars 
if they do not  our costs will become more directly subject to foreign exchange fluctuations 
these factors could adversely affect our sales of products and services in international markets 
our failure to address laws and regulations governing our government contracts  could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we depend on contracts with state and local governmental agencies for a significant portion of our revenue  and are subject to various laws and regulations that only apply to companies doing business with the government 
for example  we supply call box products and provide system installation and long term maintenance services to regional and municipal transit authorities and other governmental agencies 
in fiscal  we derived percent of our revenue from contracts with these governmental customers 
from time to time we are also subject to investigation for compliance with regulations governing our government contracts 
our failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in suspension of these contracts  or subject us to administrative claims 
disruptions in our relationships with our suppliers or in our suppliers operations could result in shortages of necessary components and adversely affect our operations 
we currently procure  and expect to continue to procure  certain components from single source manufacturers who provide unique component designs or who meet certain quality and performance requirements 
in addition  we sometimes purchase customized components from single sources in order to take advantage of volume pricing discounts 
in fiscal  the contract manufacturer of our chargesource products provided million  or percent of all inventory purchases  and the contract manufacturer of our printed circuit boards provided million  or percent of all inventory purchases 
the performance of these suppliers is largely outside of our control 
in the past  we have experienced  and may continue to experience  shortages of important single source components 
our suppliers may fail to timely deliver components or provide components of sufficient quality 
if this occurs  we may need to adjust both product designs and production schedules  which could result in delays in the production and delivery of products to our customers 
these delays or defects could harm our reputation  impair our customer relationships  and adversely affect our operations 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation  settlement or licensing costs and expenses or be prevented from selling certain products 
third parties have claimed  and may in the future claim  that we are infringing their intellectual property rights 
these intellectual property infringement claims  whether we ultimately are found to be infringing any third party s intellectual property rights or not  are time consuming  costly to defend  and divert resources and management attention away from our operations 
infringement claims by third parties also could subject us to significant damage awards or fines or require us to pay large amounts to settle such claims 
additionally  claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
if we cannot or do not license the 
table of contents infringed technology on acceptable terms or substitute similar technology from other sources  we could be prevented from or restricted in selling our products containing  or manufactured with  the infringed technology 
third parties may infringe our intellectual property rights  and we may be required to spend significant resources enforcing these rights or otherwise suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
we generally rely upon patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws in the united states and in certain other countries  and upon confidentiality agreements with our employees  customers  and partners to establish and maintain our intellectual proprietary rights in our proprietary technology 
we are required to spend significant resources to monitor and enforce our intellectual property rights  however these rights might not necessarily provide us with a sufficient competitive advantage 
our intellectual proprietary rights could be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented by competitors or others 
our employees  customers or partners could breach our confidentiality agreements  for which we may not have an adequate remedy available 
we also may not be able to timely detect the infringement of our intellectual property rights  which could harm our competitive position 
finally  the rapid pace of technological change in the wireless communications and consumer electronics industries could make certain of our key proprietary technology obsolete or provide us with less of a competitive advantage 
if we suffer the loss of our manufacturing facility due to catastrophe  our operations would be adversely affected 
we have one manufacturing facility  which is located in lake forest  california 
although we carry insurance for property damage  we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for all possible catastrophes  including interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism 
any significant disruption in our manufacturing operations at the facility  whether due to fire  natural disaster  or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
additionally  as previously discussed  during fiscal we transitioned the manufacturing of our chargesource products to a contract manufacturer located in china 
if any significant disruption occurs in the facility in china  it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
we depend upon the services of key personnel  and may not be able to attract and retain additional key personnel 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our key research  engineering  sales  marketing  and executive personnel 
if for any reason our key personnel left our employ and we failed to replace a sufficient number of these personnel  we might not be able to maintain or expand our business 
competition for such highly skilled personnel in our wireless communications and consumer electronics industries is intense  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to hire or re hire sufficiently qualified personnel in adequate numbers to meet the demand for our products and services 
if we are unable to identify  hire  and integrate these skilled personnel in a timely or cost efficient manner  our operating results could suffer 
we may not be able to successfully integrate future acquisitions  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we have acquired  and are likely to acquire in the future  businesses  products  and technologies that complement or expand our current operations 
acquisitions could require significant capital investments and require us to integrate with companies that have different cultures  management teams  and business infrastructure 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  our successful integration of the acquisition could depend on several factors  including difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  products  and workforce of an acquired business  the retention of key employees  
table of contents management of facilities and employees in separate geographic areas  the integration or coordination of different research and development and product manufacturing facilities  successfully converting information and accounting systems  and diversion of resources and management attention from our other operations 
if market conditions or other factors require us to change our strategic direction  we may fail to realize the expected value from one or more of our acquisitions 
our failure to successfully integrate our acquisitions or realize the expected value from past or future acquisitions could harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may need additional capital in the future to fund the growth of our businesses  which we may not be able to obtain or obtain on acceptable terms 
we currently anticipate that our available capital resources and operating income will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  it is not assured that such resources will be sufficient to fund the long term growth of our business 
in particular  we may experience a negative operating cash flow due to the timing of anticipated sales of our products 
we may raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings if such financings become available on favorable terms or we may seek working capital financing under a revolving line of credit 
we cannot be certain that any additional financing we may need will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop new products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures  and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and  if our operating results decline or are worse than expected  our stock price could fall 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant quarterly fluctuations in revenue and operating results for our three businesses 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate for many reasons  including the size and timing of customer orders and shipments  the degree and rate of growth in the markets in which we compete and the accompanying demand for our products  limitations in our ability to forecast our manufacturing needs  our ability to introduce  and the timing of our introductions of  new or enhanced products  product failures and recalls  product quality control problems and associated in field service support costs  warranty expenses  availability and cost of components  and changes in average sales prices 
due to these and other factors  our past results are not reliable indicators of our future performance 
in addition  a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed due to sales  engineering  and manufacturing overhead 
if we experience a decline in revenue  we may be unable to reduce our fixed costs quickly enough to compensate for the decline  which would magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations 
if our operating results decline or are below expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our stock may decline significantly 

table of contents our stock price has been and will likely remain highly volatile 
the stock market in general  and the stock prices of technology and wireless communications companies in particular  have experienced fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
broad market and industry stock price fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock 
the market price of our stock has exhibited significant price fluctuations  which makes our stock unsuitable for many investors 
our stock price may also be affected by the following factors our quarterly operating results  changes in the wireless communications and consumer electronics industries  changes in the economic outlook of the particular markets in which we sell our products and services  the gain or loss of significant customers  reductions in demand or expectations of future demand by our customers  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us  our competitors  or our customers  the timing and announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors or by us  and other events affecting other companies that investors deem comparable to us 
our articles of incorporation and shareholder rights plan could make a potential acquisition that is not approved by our board of directors more difficult 
provisions of our articles of incorporation could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
our articles of incorporation prohibit the consummation of a merger  reorganization or recapitalization  sale or lease of a substantial amount of assets with  or issuance of equity securities valued at million or more to a stockholder that owns percent or more of our common stock  unless certain requirements relating to board or shareholder approval are met 
our articles of incorporation also prohibit shareholder action by written consent  which could make certain changes of control more difficult by requiring the holding of a special meeting of shareholders for purposes of taking shareholder action 
these provisions in our articles of incorporation could discourage takeover attempts which some shareholders might deem to be in their best interests or in which shareholders would receive a premium for their shares over the then existing market price of our common stock 
in february  our board of directors terminated our shareholder rights plan effective january  and adopted a policy that  with certain exceptions  requires the board of directors to obtain stockholder approval before adopting any shareholder rights plan in the future 
the trading volume of our common stock often has been limited and may depress the price for our common stock 
the trading volume of our common stock has been and may continue to be limited 
limited trading volume could depress the price for our common stock because fewer analysts may provide coverage for our stock and because investors might be unwilling to pay a higher market price for a stock that is less liquid 
in addition  limited trading volume  along with market and industry stock price fluctuations and other factors affecting our operations  could result in greater volatility in the price of our common stock 
a significant decline in our stock price  even if temporary  could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders and could subject us to costly and disruptive securities litigation

industry and company trends and uncertainties mobile power products chargesource designed with the needs of the traveling professional in mind  our chargesource external mobile power adapters provide a high level of functionality and compatibility in an industry leading compact design 
our current and planned chargesource product offering consists of external ac dc  ac  and dc power adapters designed for the right mix of power output and functionality for most retail  oem  and enterprise customers 
our chargesource products are also programmable  allowing those who use rechargeable electronic devices to carry just one power adapter 
by simply changing the compact smarttip connected to the end of the charging cable  our external power adapters are capable of charging and powering multiple devices  including most notebook computers  mobile phones  and many other handheld devices without requiring a peripheral product 
personal computer manufacturers continue to design and manufacture notebook computers with enhanced functionality and features 
these notebook computers generally have greater power requirements 
as power requirements increase  so generally does the size of the oem power adapter sold with each notebook computer 
to address this industry wide trend  we have developed a family of compact high power chargesource external power adapters that are compatible with most legacy  current  and planned notebook computers 
these new chargesource external power adapters are able to deliver up to watts of power in a very small form factor 
management currently considers the following additional trends  events  and uncertainties to be important to understanding our chargesource business as of january   kensington  a tier one distributor of consumer electronics  was the exclusive retail channel distributor of our chargesource products and has been the source of the majority of our chargesource revenue 

table of contents during fiscal  we began shipping to kensington as they obtained product placement within the retail channel 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a non exclusive distribution arrangement with kensington  thereby terminating our exclusive distribution agreement 
under this non exclusive agreement  we have the right to penetrate all channels with multiple partners and kensington has the right to purchase our products at competitive prices without volume minimums 
kensington is also able to purchase mobile power products from our competitors 
chargesource revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal decreased to million compared to the prior fiscal quarters 
additionally  we entered the first quarter of fiscal with a backlog of purchase orders from kensington totaling approximately million 
we believe kensington is currently selling through accumulated inventory of our chargesource products 
due to the transition to a non exclusive distribution model  we expect to experience some disruption over the next several quarters 
in response to increased competition  as well as our transition to a non exclusive distribution model  we expect to achieve lower average selling prices and related gross margins on our chargesource products in fiscal wireless test solutions our wts business designs and manufactures hardware and software tools for use by wireless carriers  equipment vendors  and others 
radio engineers  network improvement professionals and technicians  and others use these test tools to deploy and optimize wireless networks  and to verify the performance of the wireless networks and resulting quality of service once deployed 
wireless carriers are the primary customers for our wts products 
these customers operate in an environment driven by new technology  increased competition  and regulatory change 
to compete effectively  the wireless carriers must offer their subscribers lower prices  improved quality of service  and innovative new services 
increasing minutes of use  global subscribers  and data intensive applications are driving higher capacity utilization of existing networks  requiring wireless carriers around the globe to place a greater emphasis on capital expenditures devoted to their wireless networks 
despite this greater emphasis  current demand for our wts products has decreased compared to the prior fiscal year driven by widespread industry consolidation  delays in purchasing decisions by our customers  increased competition  and increased pricing pressure 
management currently considers the following additional trends  events  and uncertainties to be important to understanding our wts business sales in north america were down for fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease is primarily due to reduced sales to verizon wireless verizon during fiscal as we completed two significant contracts that were awarded during fiscal while we expect to upgrade verizon s seven 
five voice and data test systems in fiscal  related upgrade revenue is expected to be less than sales of systems to verizon during fiscal and sales in our european region were down significantly for fiscal compared to fiscal swissqual  which was acquired by spirent during january  served as the exclusive reseller of our wts products in our european region through december  swissqual is now a direct competitor and is actively marketing competing qos products globally 
during november  in response to increased competition in the qos market  we announced a cooperative alliance with ascom  a leading specialist in wireless onsite communications solutions based in switzerland  to develop  market  and support next generation wireless network qos  optimization  and test measurement systems 
together we are currently developing harmonized test and measurement systems and solutions for g and g wireless standards  accelerating the availability of upgrades to the 
table of contents installed base in europe and our home markets  while enabling the rapid deployment of new products 
these harmonized products and solutions are expected to be available during the second half of fiscal additionally  we will share sales and support resources with ascom on a global basis and we no longer intend to establish a direct sales and support organization for our european region 
we believe our ascom alliance will enhance our technologies  positioning  and global footprint for sales and support 
however  we are unsure as to what long term effect this alliance will have on future sales of our products 
our success will depend in part upon our ability to co develop harmonized products and solutions under the ascom alliance 
current demand for our next generation mobile test equipment continues to be soft across all our regions as wireless carriers delay deployment of capital for such mobile test tools 
wts revenue for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal  underscoring the challenges of our wts business  which include a consolidating customer base comprised of a relatively small number of wireless carriers and equipment vendors  as well as uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of anticipated orders from such customer base 
additionally  we expect increased competition in our european region from swissqual and others 
we expect our ability to compete on a global basis to be driven by our ability to offer products that cover all current wireless technologies  as well as the timely integration of new technology and functionality into our product platform 
under the terms of agreements with both swissqual and ascom  we are entitled to receive a portion of revenue derived from certain of their respective sales 
the amount to be received is dependant upon the customer and corresponding geographic region  the products sold  their configuration  as well as the hardware and software content of the products 
these agreements are reciprocal and we are obligated to make payments to the other parties under similar conditions 
as a result  it is difficult to predict when we will receive such revenue from the parties  which could impact any one quarter positively or negatively 
through the end of fiscal  revenue attributable to swissqual sales was deferred until receipt of payment 
commencing with the first quarter of fiscal  we changed our accounting for sales to swissqual by recognizing revenue on a full accrual basis 
this change was made based upon swissqual s financial strength and payment history and the lack of our ability to assert financial influence over the operations of swissqual 
wts revenue for fiscal was increased by approximately million due to this change 
during fiscal  we recorded revenue attributable to verizon totaling approximately million as we completed delivering on a contrract awarded in fiscal and delivered upgrades to previously purchased systems 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we were awarded a contract from verizon for our seven 
five voice and data test systems 
verizon was converting its nationwide wireless network to the cdma evdo standard  which is considered to be the us equivalent of g  and is utilizing seven 
five to measure the quality of its network 
we began delivering on this contract during the second quarter of fiscal and completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and we recorded revenue attributable to this contract totaling approximately million  excluding amortization of first year maintenance obligations 
additionally  during the third quarter of fiscal  we were awarded an additional contract from verizon to replace data testing equipment previously sourced from a competitor with our seven 
five data systems 
we delivered on the contract during the fourth quarter of fiscal and recorded revenue attributable to this contract totaling approximately million  excluding amortization of first year maintenance obligations 
the two verizon contracts discussed above were significant to our wts business and its operations for fiscal and while we currently expect to continue to win new business from verizon during fiscal  we do not expect this new business to recur at the same level achieved during fiscal and 
table of contents emergency call box systems our emergency call box business designs  manufactures  and maintains emergency call box systems 
our call box products provide emergency communication over existing wireless networks 
in addition to call box products  we provide system installation and long term maintenance services 
currently  there are approximately  call boxes that we maintain under long term agreements that expire at various dates through february wireless carriers have begun reallocating spectrum away from analog  or first generation  wireless technologies to digital  or g and g  wireless technologies 
as a result  state and local governmental agencies are continuing to upgrade their existing call box systems to digital to maintain the functional efficiencies of their call box systems 
our upgraded call box products  based on g gsm and cdma wireless technologies  offer a complete solution of current technology and services at a low cost designed to meet our customers needs 
during fiscal and  we executed on multiple upgrade contracts primarily driven by the demand for digital wireless technologies 
we expect to substantially complete upgrading the installed base in fiscal management currently considers the following additional trends  events  and uncertainties to be important to understanding our call box business during fiscal  we upgraded approximately  call boxes with digital and or text telephony technologies and recorded revenue totaling approximately million 
such upgrade revenue also included revenue related to retrofit  site mitigation  and call box removal activities performed in conjunction with the upgrade of the call box systems 
during fiscal  we upgraded approximately  call boxes and recorded revenue totaling approximately million  which also includes revenue related to retrofit  site mitigation activities  and call box removal activities 
during fiscal  we were awarded a contract by imperial county to upgrade its existing analog call box system with digital and tty technologies valued at approximately million 
we commenced work on this contract in the fourth quarter of fiscal and recorded revenue totaling approximately million 
we completed this project during the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we were awarded a contract by riverside county to upgrade its existing analog call box system to digital technology 
subsequent to the award  our customer delayed the start of the upgrade project in order to refine the final configuration and scope of the project 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we were notified by our customer that the contract will be amended to add tty devices 
we expect to commence work on this project during fiscal as of january   we maintain approximately  call boxes under maintenance agreements with terms that range from one to ten years 
certain of our safe customers have removed or have indicated that they intend to remove call boxes to reduce the density of the systems and to make funds available for the necessary digital and tty upgrades 
during fiscal the installed base of call boxes under maintenance contracts was reduced by approximately  call boxes 
during fiscal  the contract to upgrade approximately  call boxes owned by capital valley regional safe cvrs with digital and tty technologies was awarded to a competitor 
in the event the competitor is able to perform under the upgrade contract  we would cease to provide maintenance services is support of the cvrs call box system during the fourth quarter of fiscal and thereafter 
service revenue attributable to the cvrs maintenance contracted totaled million for fiscal we currently expect service revenue attributable to maintenance of existing call box systems to total approximately million in fiscal we expect a decline in call box product revenue during fiscal as we expect to substantially complete the previously awarded digital and tty upgrade contracts 
current and anticipated projects to upgrade and expand existing call box systems are concentrated with several customers that are agencies of california s state and local governments  from whom we currently generate approximately percent of our call box revenue 
in addition  we believe that the 
table of contents severe financial challenges experienced by california state government created uncertainty for our governmental customers in california  causing them to delay upgrades and expansions of certain call box systems 
while this trend appears to have reversed  as evidenced by the awarded projects discussed above  we continue to be vulnerable to the spending patterns of our customers that are concentrated in california 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to apply accounting policies and make certain estimates and judgments 
our significant accounting policies are presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
of our significant accounting policies  we believe the following involve a higher degree of uncertainty  subjectivity and judgments 
these policies involve estimates and judgments that are inherently uncertain 
changes in these estimates and judgments may significantly impact our annual and quarterly operating results 
we have identified the following as our most significant critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue upon shipment provided there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
generally  our products are shipped fob named point of shipment  whether it is lake forest  our corporate headquarters  or hong kong  the shipping point of our chargesource products 
shipments to swissqual  our former exclusive wts distributor in europe  are shipped delivery duties unpaid ddu 
under ddu  title and risk of loss for the goods shipped passes to the buyer at destination 
our wts products are integrated with embedded software 
accordingly  we recognize revenue using the residual method pursuant to requirements of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
under the residual method  we allocate revenue to the undelivered element  typically maintenance  based on its respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
we amortize the revenue allocated to the maintenance element evenly over the term of the maintenance commitment made at the time of sale 
we expense as incurred the costs associated with honoring the maintenance commitment 
the revenue attributable to the delivered product is the residual amount after subtracting the revenue allocated to the undelivered element from the sales price 
the revenue attributable to the delivered product is recognized following the policy for product sales described above 
we recognize service revenue as the services are performed 
maintenance revenue from extended warranty sales is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  typically to month periods 
significant management judgments must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
for our wts business  management must make judgments  for example  regarding uncertainties surrounding customer acceptance because some orders may include acceptance test provisions that require we defer revenue upon shipment until such time as the client has accepted the equipment 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments 
stock based compensation effective february   the start of our fiscal year  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method and  therefore  have not revised prior periods results for the adoption of this accounting statement 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to be measured based on the award s fair value on the date of grant  and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of 
table of contents our share based payments 
the black scholes option pricing model is based on a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected forfeiture rates  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
if the assumptions change  stock based compensation may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
for fiscal years and  stock based compensation was determined under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for stock based compensation plans 
software development costs we had million of capitalized software as of january   net of accumulated amortization of million 
capitalized software amortization expense is included in cost of revenue 
we capitalize software developed for sale or lease in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
software costs incurred subsequent to the determination of the technological feasibility of the software product are capitalized 
technological feasibility is generally demonstrated by the completion of a working model 
our policy is to capitalize the costs associated with development of new products and expense the costs associated with new releases  which primarily consist of enhancements or increased functionality of software embedded in existing products 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether technological feasibility has been achieved for a particular software project and in estimating the economic life of the related product 
capitalization ceases and amortization of capitalized costs begins when the software product is available for general release to our customers 
each quarter we compare capitalized software development costs to our estimate of projected revenues quarterly to determine if any impairment in value has occurred that would require an adjustment in the carrying value or change in expected useful lives under the guidelines established under sfas no 
we also continually evaluate the recoverability of software acquired through acquisition or by direct purchase of technology 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits and related terms based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continually monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
specifically  our management must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
management analyzes specific customer accounts and establishes reserves for uncollectible receivables based upon specific identification of account balances that have indications of uncertainty of collection 
indications of uncertainty of collections may include the customer s inability to pay  customer dissatisfaction  or other factors 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our losses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
valuation of inventory we value inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory calculated on average costs  which approximates first in  first out basis or market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a write down of excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on excess quantities 
table of contents on hand based upon historical and forecasted component usage 
as demonstrated during prior periods  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
in the future  if our inventory were determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our operating results 
income taxes we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense in conjunction with the evaluation and measurement of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary timing differences result in the establishment of deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on a net basis and included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess on a periodic basis the probability that our net deferred tax assets  if any  will be recovered 
if after evaluating all of the positive and negative evidence  a conclusion is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be recovered  a valuation allowance is provided with a corresponding charge to tax expense to reserve the portion of the deferred tax assets which are estimated to be more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any required valuation allowance 
during the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of incurring cumulative losses for a three year period  we established a valuation allowance totaling approximately million  or the entire deferred tax asset balance existing as of the beginning of fiscal this valuation allowance was established based on management s overall assessment of risks and uncertainties related to our future ability to realize  and hence  utilize certain deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses  carry forward temporary differences and future tax deductions resulting from certain types of stock option exercises 
due to the current and prior years operating losses  the adjusted net deferred tax assets remain fully reserved as of january  valuation of goodwill we account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  we no longer amortize goodwill from acquisitions  but continue to amortize other acquisition related intangibles and costs 
as of january   we had million of goodwill recorded in our audited consolidated balance sheet 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value generally determined using a discounted cash flow methodology applied to the particular unit 
this methodology differs from our previous policy  in accordance with accounting standards existing at that time  of using undiscounted cash flows on an enterprise wide basis to determine recoverability 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of january   and identified no impairment 
the impairment review is based upon a discounted cash flow approach that uses estimates of future market share and revenue and costs for the reporting units  as well as appropriate discount rates 
the estimates used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying businesses 
however  if we fail to deliver new products for these groups  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable  revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill 

table of contents for intangible assets with definite useful lives  we amortize the cost over the estimated useful lives and assess any impairment by estimating the future cash flow from the associated asset in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we also annually review the useful lives of each of our intangible assets 
as of january   we had million of non goodwill acquired intangible assets recorded in intangible assets  which includes million for software rights and million for intellectual property rights 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets used in operations  including purchased intangible assets  when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns that negatively impact our customers or markets  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of assets is impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using a weighted average of the market approach and the discounted expected future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our cost of capital 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected discounted cash flows 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future net revenue  the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies  or both  could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these assets 
in that event  additional impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long lived assets could be required

the fiscal increase in cost of revenue of million compared to fiscal  is primarily attributable to the percent volume increase in product revenue 
cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased to percent from percent for fiscal the fiscal decrease in cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue was primarily due to the percent volume increase in wts product revenue compared to fiscal  which typically has higher margins compared to our chargesource and call box products

the fiscal decrease in selling  general  and administrative expenses of million compared to fiscal  was attributable to the recovery of bad debt expense related to our wts business  totaling approximately million in fiscal  compared to bad debt expense recorded in fiscal of approximately the same amount 
allocated corporate overhead consists of salaries and other personnel related expenses of our accounting and finance  human resources and benefits  and other administrative personnel  as well as professional fees  directors fees  and other costs and expenses attributable to being a public company 
these costs are typically allocated to our three businesses based on each business s percentage share of total company costs and expenses

we capitalize costs incurred for the development of software embedded in our wts products subsequent to establishing technological feasibility 
these capitalized costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based on anticipated future revenue and changes in hardware and software technologies 
costs that are capitalized include direct labor and related overhead 
we did not capitalize any software development costs in fiscal or other income  net other income  net  consists primarily of interest income earned on invested cash balances 
other income  net  was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the increases in fiscal and in other income compared to the respective prior fiscal years was due to increases in our cash balances coupled with higher interest rates 
gain on sale of investment in swissqual and intangible asset as further discussed in the section entitled results of operations wireless test solutions during january  we sold our percent interest in swissqual 
upon the closing of the transaction  we received approximately million of the closing consideration  net of transaction costs  and may receive up to an additional million of any escrow distribution and contingent consideration 
we recorded a gain on sale of investment totaling million  which was based on the cash consideration we received 
during fiscal  the company received million of contingent consideration  net of million of transaction costs  recorded as gain on sale of investment in swissqual 
prior to the sale transaction  swissqual declared and paid a dividend to its then current shareholders 
during january  we recorded the approximately million dividend declared as a reduction in the cost basis of our investment in swissqual 
additionally  during december  we sold rights to software to swissqual for approximately million 
at the time of the sale  such software rights had an unamortized book value of approximately million

for the first three quarters of fiscal  chargesource revenue ranged between million and million per quarter 
for the fourth quarter of fiscal chargesource revenue decreased to million compared to the prior fiscal quarters 
we believe kensington reduced their orders during the fourth quarter of fiscal in an effort to reduce their inventory of previously purchased chargesource products 
as discussed above  this trend continued in the first quarter of fiscal during which we did not receive significant orders from kensington 
in april  we entered into a new non exclusive distribution agreement with kensington

during fiscal  our design and development efforts focused on a single external high power adapter platform intended to meet the requirements of retail distribution  as well as the notebook computer oems 
currently  we expect to release this platform in various configurations during the third quarter of fiscal the fiscal increase in engineering and support expenses of million compared to fiscal  was primarily due to the addition of engineering design resources  including employees  temporary labor  and outside design consultants  in support of numerous development programs intended to address the need for external high and low power adapters  oem design and performance requirements  and national and international regulatory requirements

these contracts were significant to our wts business and its operations for fiscal and were primarily responsible 
table of contents for the fiscal revenue increase in our north american region  which increased percent compared to fiscal revenue in fiscal derived from our customers in latin america south america decreased percent compared to fiscal this decrease highlights that the wireless industry is composed of a relatively small number of wireless carriers and equipment vendors  which can lead to volatility in our results and that our business is characterized by sales to a limited set of customers in each region where we do business

the fiscal decrease in engineering and support expenses of million compared to fiscal  was due to decreased product development activity during fiscal and reduced consumption of development material 
the redesign of our tty upgrade device was substantially completed during fiscal business outlook fiscal is expected to be a year of transition 
we currently expect to continue to transition the retail distribution of our chargesource products to multiple distribution partners under non exclusive distribution agreements 
shipments to kensington under a recently executed non exclusive distribution agreement are expected to commence during the second half of fiscal additionally  fiscal revenue from sales to kensington are expected to be significantly less than achieved during fiscal we are currently developing two chargesource products specifically for a leading oem of notebook computers to be branded and marketed by the oem in conjunction with the sale of notebook computers 
if 
table of contents successful  we expect to go into volume production during the second half of fiscal our chargesource business is also responding to interest from the leading oems for small form factor power adapters to be sold in the box with notebook computers 
it is difficult to predict the timing and amount of any revenue attributable to this in the box initiative 
however  we are in negotiations with tier one electronics contract manufactures to enable us to execute on these highly price competitive high volume opportunities 
during fiscal  demand for our wts products decreased compared to the prior fiscal year due to widespread industry consolidation  delays in purchasing decisions by customers  primarily wireless carriers  and increased competition and price pressure 
it is difficult to predict when these negative trends will abate or improve 
while it may take several quarters for market demand to recover  we continue to develop the next generation g and g wireless network optimization and qos systems through our alliance with ascom ag  a leading swiss company with the largest installed base of wireless qos systems in the world 
these new products are expected to be available for sale during the second half of fiscal we currently expect wts revenue for fiscal to be less than wts revenue for fiscal during fiscal  our call box business is expected to substantially complete the digital and tty upgrade contracts awarded in the prior fiscal years 
as a significant portion of the installed base was upgraded during fiscal  we expect call box revenue for fiscal to decrease compared to fiscal during fiscal  the amount and timing of call upgrade revenue was impacted by customer delays 
upgrade contracts expected to be completed during fiscal could also be subject to customer delays 
discontinued operations on january   we sold the net assets of our reporting unit edx 
this reporting unit was formerly included in the wireless test solutions segment  and has been classified as discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations was  for fiscal  which includes income from operations of  on revenue of million  plus an after tax gain of  on the sale of edx 
additionally  during fiscal  we sold our defense and commercial staffing businesses  the non wireless businesses 
in fiscal  we recorded income of  related primarily to the release of indemnification provisions provided by the terms of one of these sale transactions

table of contents reserves of million  million  and million  respectively  and a decrease in inventory of million offset by the current year gain on sale of swissqual of million  a decrease in accrued liabilities of million  and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
the decrease in accrued liabilities relates primarily to the payout of fiscal accrued bonuses of million and a reduction in accrued uninvoiced receipts for inventory purchases 
previously  we included cash flows from discontinued operations as a single amount in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
in fiscal  we separately disclosed the components of cash flows of discontinued operations  reconciled operating cash flows from net income rather than income from continuing operations  and restated our statements of cash flows for fiscal to conform to the current presentation 
cash flows from investing activities we purchased million of property and equipment in fiscal compared to million of property and equipment in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in current year capital expenditures of million relates primarily to tenant improvements of million made relating to our corporate relocation as well as equipment built for a revenue sharing contract with one of our wts customers 
the decrease in fiscal is primarily due to transitioning manufacturing of our chargesource products from in house to a contract manufacturer located in china 
accordingly  we no longer have requirements to acquire  upgrade  and maintain chargesource production equipment 
additionally  we have outsourced the design of non critical components to our supply chain located in asia  which has reduced our on going investment in tooling 
during the first half of fiscal  we completed the software development of our seven 
five product platform  which is compatible with all g  g  and g wireless technologies 
during fiscal and subsequent to the completion of the development program  we transitioned into a maintenance mode 
accordingly  we capitalized no software development costs in fiscal   and in fiscal  we capitalized software development costs totaling million 
currently  we do not expect to capitalize any software development in fiscal as our seven 
five product platform is a modular solution that can be upgraded for new wireless technologies and configured for all wireless carriers irrespective of the wireless technologies deployed 
in conjunction with the development and maintenance of seven 
five  we expended million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  on rights to various wireless technologies 
during january  we sold our percent interest in swissqual to spirent 
see the wireless test solutions section of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
prior to the acquisition by spirent  swissqual declared and paid a dividend to its then current shareholders 
during january  we recorded the approximately million dividend declared as a reduction in the cost basis of our investment in swissqual 
as of january   we received approximately million  net of million withheld by swiss tax authorities which was recaptured in the first quarter of fiscal additionally  during december  we sold rights to software to swissqual for approximately million 
at the time of the sale  such software rights had an unamortized book value of approximately million 
accordingly  we recorded a gain on sale of intangible assets totaling approximately million 
cash flows from financing activities during  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million shares of our common stock 
from program inception through january   we repurchased approximately million shares for an average price of per share 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately  shares in the open market for a total cost of approximately million  or an average price of per share 
during fiscal we had no stock 
table of contents repurchases 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal in fiscal proceeds from the sales of common stock issued through employee and director stock option plans constituted all of our cash flows from financing activities 
subsequent to january  we declared a special dividend of per share to shareholders of record on april   paid on april  the amount paid was approximately million 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances will provide us sufficient funds to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
in addition to our cash and cash equivalent balances  we expect to derive a portion of our liquidity from our cash flows from operations 
as discussed above  certain factors and events could negatively affect our cash flows from operations  including in conjunction with our alliance with ascom  we are currently developing harmonized test and measurement systems 
in the event we experience delays in development and deployment of new products we may experience a significant reduction in revenue  operating results and cash flows 
due to the uncertainties associated with the spending patterns of our customers and the corresponding demand for our wts products  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in demand 
such fluctuations have caused and may continue to cause significant reductions in revenue  operating results  and cash flows 
in the event kensington or any other distributors of our chargesource products  are unable to perform under their non cancelable commitments due to their inability to take delivery of the products and or pay for such products in a timely manner  we would be required to establish alternative distribution channels 
such significant change would negatively impact our revenue  operating results  and cash flows 
should the contract manufacturer of our chargesource products become unable to manufacture our chargesource products at the level currently anticipated  our operating results and cash flows would be negatively impacted 
we are focused on preserving our cash balances by continuously monitoring expenses  identifying cost savings  and investing only in those development programs and products most likely to contribute to our profitability 
contractual obligations in the course of our business operations  we incur certain commitments to make future payments under contracts such as operating leases and purchase orders 
payments under these contracts are summarized as follows as of january  in thousands payments due by period less than year to years to years total operating lease obligations purchase obligations recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin requires the use of a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
we are required to adopt fin effective february  the cumulative effect of initially adopting fin is to record an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption and should be presented separately 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized upon adoption of fin we are in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of the interpretation on our consolidated financial statements

this new standard establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities 
this framework is intended to provide increased consistency in how fair value determinations are made under various existing accounting standards that permit  or in some cases require  estimates of fair market value 
statement no 
also expands financial statement disclosure requirements about a company s use of fair value measurements  including the effect of such measures on earnings

in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab requires that public companies utilize a dual approach to assess the quantitative effects of financial misstatements 
this dual approach includes both an income statement focused assessment and a balance sheet focused assessment 
the guidance in sab must be applied to annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

this standard amends sfas  accounting for certain investment in debt and equity securities  with respect to accounting for a transfer to the trading category for all entities with available for sale and trading securities electing the fair value option 
this standard allows companies to elect fair value accounting for many financial instruments and other items that currently are not required to be accounted as such  allows different applications for electing the option for a single item or groups of items  and requires disclosures to facilitate comparisons of similar assets and liabilities that are accounted for differently in relation to the fair value option 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which for us is fiscal we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency risk we are exposed to the risk of changes in currency exchange rates 
as of january   we had no material accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
our standard terms require customers to pay for our products and services in us dollars 
for those orders denominated in foreign currencies  we may limit our exposure to losses from foreign currency transactions through forward foreign exchange contracts 
to date  sales denominated in foreign currencies have not been significant and we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts 
interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
to minimize this risk  we maintain a significant portion of our cash balances in money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments 
our cash and cash equivalents have maturities dates of three months or less and the fair value approximates the carrying value in our consolidated financial statements 
equity price risk our short term investments consist of balances maintained in a non qualified deferred compensation plan funded by our executives and directors 
we value these investments using the closing market value for the last day of each month 
these investments are subject to market price volatility 
we reflect these investments on our balance sheet at their market value  with the unrealized gains and losses reflected as adjustments to both short term investments and the deferred compensation liability 
due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments  and in light of current stock market conditions  we may incur future losses on the sales  write downs  or write offs of our investments 
we do not currently hedge against equity price changes
