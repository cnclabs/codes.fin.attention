critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
significant estimates in these financial statements include revenue recognition  provision for sales returns and allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts  estimates for useful lives associated with long lived assets  asset impairments  net realizable value of inventories  certain accrued liabilities and provision for income taxes and tax valuation allowance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are those that both are most important to the portrayal of the financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often requiring estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these critical accounting policies reflect our significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures in relation to this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from direct product sales to end user customers upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is upon shipment of the product provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  no significant obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for sales to original equipment manufacturers oems  we use either a binding purchase order or signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for those customers which have a hub arrangement  we recognize sales when our products are transferred from the hub to the customer s manufacturing facility 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a distributor agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
because of the uncertainty associated with pricing concessions and possible returns  we defer the recognition of sales to all our distributors  domestic and foreign  and the related costs of sales until our distributors have sold the merchandise to their end user customers 
our distributors provide us an inventory balance report at the end of each period  which enables us to determine products sold to their end customer 
we recognize revenue from our nre contracts upon completion of contract milestones  which corresponds to when we provide the services and or products 
revenue is deferred for any amounts received prior to completion of contract milestones  such as amounts received upon delivery of proto type  if such a delivery is an agreed upon milestone 
some of our nre contracts include formal customer acceptance provisions 
in this case  at the end of each period  we determine whether customer acceptance has been obtained for the specific milestone 
if customer acceptance has not been obtained  we defer the recognition of such revenue until customer acceptance is obtained 
sales returns and other allowances we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical experience  analyses of outstanding return material authorization and allowance authorization data and any other form of notification we receive of pending returns 
we continuously monitor and track product returns and in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer return or allowance which is over and above normal historical sales returns  we record a specific allowance against the amounts due  to reduce our net receivable from such customer 
while our sales returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  we evaluate specific accounts where we have information that a specific customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations to us for example due to bankruptcy  etc in these cases  significant management judgments and estimates must be made  based on the best available facts and circumstances 
we record a specific allowance for that customer against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
these specific reserves are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
second  a minimum allowance is established for all other customer receivables as a percentage applied to outstanding accounts receivable 
this percentage is based on our historical collection and write off experience 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or net realizable value and include high technology parts and components that are specialized in nature and subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
standard manufacturing cost includes materials  labor  and overhead costs including depreciation  and includes factors for estimated production yield and throughput time 
we determine net realizable value of our inventories based on the last selling price  net of selling cost  of our products prior to the balance sheet date 
if there has been no recent sale of a particular product  the expected selling price  net of selling cost is deemed as the net realizable value 
inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or net realizable value 
any adjustment to write down inventory to net realizable value is charged to the cost of sales in the period that the adjustment is made 
additionally  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand during the next twelve months  which involves a great deal of management judgment on our part 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand and inventories that we consider obsolete are reserved 
in addition  we age our inventory based on start date 
inventory that has been inactive for more than one year is considered slow moving inventory and is also reserved 
additions to the provision are charged to the cost of sales 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the reduction of the allowance until these inventories are subsequently sold or scrapped 
any proceeds received will favorably impact gross margins 
while we have programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and consider technological obsolescence when estimating amounts required to reduce recorded amounts to market values  it is possible that such estimates could change in the near term 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and will be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
accounting for investments from time to time we may make investments in privately held companies  which require us to determine the carrying value of such investments 
on april  we held stock in a privately held company whose carrying value is zero 
this investment was liquidated in fiscal as of march   we do not have any investments in privately held companies 
impairment of long lived assets we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value  which we depreciate or amortize over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset where appropriate 
we may incur impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimate change 
accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities  which arise from timing differences in the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
such deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax base  operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
changes in tax rates affect the deferred income tax assets and liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the tax rates are enacted 
our management must determine the probability that it will be able to utilize its deferred tax assets 
if we determine that recovery is unlikely  then a valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset must be recorded by increasing income tax expense 
as of march   we believe that our deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will be utilized 
however  should there be a change in our ability to utilize or recover our deferred tax assets  an additional income tax expense would be incurred in the period in which it was determined that the recovery is not probable 
we maintain within our income tax payable account reserves for tax contingencies 
the reserves amount was determined with considerable judgment and estimation  and is continuously monitored by management based on the best information available including changes in tax regulations  the outcome of relevant court cases  ongoing tax audits  and other information 
irs examinations of our tax returns for fiscal years and are ongoing 
we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for additional taxes that we estimate may be required to be paid as a result of these examinations 
if the resulting tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense will result 
if payment proves unnecessary  the reversal of tax liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
see provision for incomes taxes of this section and note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
effective april   we will be required to adopt fasb interpretation no  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas fin no 

in july  the fasb issued fin no 
 which prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing  measuring  presenting and disclosing in the consolidated financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction 
fin no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  if there are changes in net assets as a result of application of fin no 
 they will be accounted for as an adjustment to retained earnings 
we are currently assessing the impact of fin no 
on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation in fiscal years through  we included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements a pro forma disclosure of the impact stock options would have on net income loss using the fair value stock option expense recognition method  as allowed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
and using an intrinsic value method  as prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
a revised standard  sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including stock options at fair value  was effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year  which began on april  the adoption of sfas r required us to apply a valuation model  which includes estimates and assumptions on the rate of forfeiture and expected life of options and stock price volatility 
see note nature of business and significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of sfas r 
if any of the assumptions used in the valuation model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period and actual results may differ from estimates 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
recent developments we operate in the highly cyclical global semiconductor market  evidenced by fluctuating demand cycles for our products 
from a net sales trough in fiscal year  demand has increased steadily in each of the past three fiscal years 
in fiscal  we experienced significant sales improvement partly due to the general economy and partly due to our many new products starting to ramp up production 
this improvement in net sales and demand for our products continued in fiscal quote activity and design wins have been strong in all the markets we serve 
our backlog is strong and our book to bill is greater than one 
these are encouraging indicators for sales growth into fiscal book to bill ratio is defined as sales orders received divided by orders shipped during the fiscal quarter 
we believe that current booked orders will be shipped in fiscal however  our customers may cancel or reschedule orders without significant penalty  and the price of products may be adjusted between the time the purchase order is booked into backlog and the time the product is shipped to the customer  although these cases have been rare 
for these reasons  purchase orders received are not necessarily reliable indicators of future sales 
we believe that we will be able to substantially meet our production needs from our wafer fabrication and testing facilities in the coming fiscal year 
results of operations fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales net sales for the fiscal year were  a increase compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
we operate in one business segment comprising of the design  development  manufacturing and marketing of high voltage analog and mixed signal integrated circuits 
a breakdown of our total sales to customers in the imaging  medical electronics  telecom and other markets as well as year over year changes are shown below in thousands the company has a broad base of customers  which in some cases manufacture end products spanning multiple markets 
as such  the assignment of revenue to the aforementioned markets requires the use of estimates  judgment  and extrapolation 
actual results may differ from those reported 
fiscal years ended markets march  april  year over year change imaging medical electronics telecom other net sales overall demand for our products in fiscal was higher compared to fiscal in all four of our major markets  which are imaging  medical electronics  telecom and other 
the increase in net sales of is primarily due to higher unit shipments in our four major focus markets as several of our products  launched in fiscal through  continued to ship in increasing volumes 
sales to the imaging market in fiscal showed an increase of over the prior year primarily due to the continued increase in unit demand for el drivers for cellular phones 
we are one of the key providers of el drivers for cell phones  pdas  and watches 
sales of our el drivers for other products and non impact inkjet printers and plotters also grew in fiscal we are the leading supplier in the high end industrial printer market  with both standard and custom products 
our sales to the medical electronics market in fiscal increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
the sales increase is attributed to an increase in ultrasound units shipped  primarily due to an increasing ultrasound market worldwide and design wins of our analog switches and multiplexers as well as our high voltage pulser ics 
in recent years  the ultrasound market experienced significant growth in the transportable  hand carried ultrasound hcu units 
these high performance  portable  affordable systems are accelerating the proliferation of ultrasound imaging to medical specialties other than the traditional clinical applications 
geographically  the market is expanding as well  as china  korea and india are now designing and producing medical ultrasound machines 
we believe that sales of our high voltage analog switches and multiplexers  high voltage pulser ics  high speed mosfet drivers  and discrete high voltage fets to this market will continue to increase as the ultrasound market continues to expand globally 
we are heavily investing in product development for the ultrasound market and we expect to introduce more new integrated pulser ics as well as ultrasound receiver blocks 
custom high voltage pulsers are projected to contribute to our revenue growth in fiscal sales to the telecom market in fiscal increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in sales was the result of increased demand for our depletion transistors for switching equipment  dc to dc converters  long haul ring generators  line protection devices  voltage sequencer ics and high voltage amplifier arrays for the optical to optical telecom market 
we project flat to moderate growth in this market during fiscal sales to the other market in fiscal increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily due to introduction of our new line of led and led backlight drivers for flat screen tvs and general lighting 
we expect increasing sales in this market  especially in the second half of fiscal and plan to report led and led backlight drivers as a separate market focus beginning in the first quarter of fiscal our principal markets are in the china  united states  asia  and europe 
sales by geography  based on where we ship our products rather than where the customers headquarters are located  as well as year over year change were as follows fiscal years ended dollars in thousands march  april  year over year change china asia excl 
china japan united states europe japan other total net sales net sales to international customers in fiscal were  or of our net sales as compared to  or of net sales for the prior fiscal year 
the increases in sales to china and the asian region are due to the growth in our overall business and the continuing transfer of our united states customer manufacturing from north americas to international locations  mainly the pacific rim region 
the increase in sales to europe is primarily due to design wins in germany 
the decrease in sales to our other customers is primarily due to products reaching the end of life 
additional discussion regarding our sales based on geographic areas can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
gross profit gross profit represents net sales less cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of purchasing raw silicon wafers  cost associated with assembly  packaging  test  quality assurance and product yields  the cost of personnel  facilities  and equipment associated with manufacturing support  and net charges for excess or obsolete inventory 
gross profit for fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  gross margin was for fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the improvement in gross margin was primarily attributed to higher sales  an increase in plant capacity utilization with economy of scale  and to a lesser degree a favorable product mix  which consisted of higher sales of our newer products replacing declining sales of the lower margin legacy products 
depreciation expense in fiscal was essentially flat with fiscal during fiscal  capital spending consisted primarily of replacement equipment with an approximate capacity increase during the fourth fiscal quarter

the provision for income taxes for fiscal was  at the estimated effective tax rate of compared to  or a effective tax rate for fiscal the higher effective tax rate in fiscal resulted from non deductible stock based compensation expense under statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  and the accrual of additional tax reserves related to prior year r d tax credits as a result of ongoing tax audits 
our effective tax rate of is less than the combined federal and state tax rate due to the benefit of tax exempt investment income and r d tax credits  offset by the adverse impact of stock based compensation expenses

overall sales to the other market declined 
the increase in net sales of our three focused markets is primarily due to higher unit shipments across these markets as semiconductor market conditions improved and several of our new products  launched in fiscal and  began shipping in higher volumes faster than normal gestation periods 
we did not have material sales price erosion on its products throughout fiscal sales to the imaging market in fiscal showed an increase of over the prior year primarily due to the continued increase in unit demand for el drivers for cellular phones

for the year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was  compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal year compared to was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable balances in fiscal  as sales softened in the second half of the fiscal year  compared to a increase at the end of fiscal  and higher net income in fiscal partially offsetting these items were an increase in inventories  a decrease in tax benefit from exercise of stock options  a reclass of non cash excess tax benefit from operating activities into financing activities as required by sfas r  and changes in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses 
fiscal year included share based compensation charges of  investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and purchases of short term investments  partially offset by sales of short term investments 
cash used in investing activities was slightly higher in fiscal year than in fiscal this was due to the timing of purchases and sales of short term investments and slightly higher capital expenditures 
we spent  expanding our wafer fab capacity by approximately during the fourth fiscal quarter of financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options under the and plans and sales of stock through the espp  reclass of non cash excess tax benefit from operating into financing activities as required by sfas r  and of repurchases of stock on the open market 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was lower compared to fiscal primarily due to reduced proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options under the and plans and sale of stock through the espp 
during fiscal  we amended the espp to decrease the discount afforded to employees from at least to  which satisfied the requirement of a non compensatory plan for sfas r purposes and reduced the employee participation in the espp 
in addition  stock option exercises declined during fiscal compared to fiscal we expect to spend approximately  for capital acquisitions in fiscal we believe that we have substantial production capacity in place to handle any projected increase in business in fiscal most of our  of property  plant and equipment  net are located in the united states 
we also believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements through the next twelve months 
fiscal our cash and cash equivalents decreased  during fiscal to  from  at april  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal is due to cash used in investment activities of  as we increased short term investments  partially offset by cash flows from operating activities of  and cash provided from financing activities of our operating activities generated cash of   and  for fiscal   and  respectively
