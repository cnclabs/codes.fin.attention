item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview the company s business consists of three segments bioproducts  biopharma and human health 
the bioproducts segment consists of research products and services and therapeutic applications 
the biopharma segment consists of the company s biopharmaceutical process development and manufacturing business 
the human health segment is primarily comprised of active pharmaceutical ingredients derived from organic chemistry and pharmaceutical intermediates 
as part of the process of evaluating strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value  on october   the sale of the cork and landen businesses  within the human health segment  was completed and accordingly  these businesses are being reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented 
as part of the process of evaluating strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value  on october   the company entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement with lonza group ag for the sale of the businesses that comprise the bioproducts and biopharma segments excluding certain liabilities for total cash consideration of  this sale was completed on february  the results of these two segments are reported as continuing operations in all periods presented 
the company will begin reporting these segments as discontinued operations during the first quarter of with the divestiture of the bioproducts and biopharma segments  cambrex will focus its efforts towards expanding its human health business 
continued expansion of the custom development pipeline  increased sales of products based on proprietary technology  and higher demand for generic apis contributed to the sales increase in this segment 
with one of the broadest portfolios of products and services in the api market  human health remains very profitable and represents a solid platform for future growth 
the following significant events occurred during which affected results from continuing operations a charge of approximately  recorded within administrative expenses for the costs related to the evaluation of strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value 
a  charge recorded within interest expense due to the pre payment of a portion of the company s long term debt 
a  charge recorded within research and development expenses due to the acquisition of cutanogen 
a  charge for the write down of an investment in equity securities 
sales in increased to  including a favorable impact resulting from foreign currency  from  in due to higher sales in all segments 
gross margins in decreased to from in due to lower human health and bioproducts margins resulting from increased production costs in the human health and bioproducts segments and lower pricing within the human health segment  partially offset by higher margins in the biopharma segment due to higher revenues 
foreign currency unfavorably impacted gross margin by in a pharmaceutical company with which a long term sales contract is in effect that is scheduled to expire at the end of  accounted for of human health sales 
the company is currently in negotiations to extend this contract to which  if the company elects to do so  will result in significantly lower profitability for sales under this arrangement in and there is no guarantee that this contract will be renewed 
the company recorded tax expense of  in compared to  in the tax provisions in and are primarily affected by the non recognition of tax benefits in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions where losses are incurred and the company records valuation allowances against the benefits  the recording of tax expense for profitable non us entities and agreed income tax audit adjustments in the us and non us entities 
dollars in thousands  except share data the company reported a loss from continuing operations of  or per diluted share in  compared to  or per diluted share  in critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are those that require the most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other various assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management under each applicable circumstance 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the differences could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
a discussion of the company s critical accounting policies  the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions  is as follows revenue recognition revenues in the bioproducts and human health segments are generally recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers 
certain contracts in the bioproducts and biopharma segments are based on time and materials and revenue for these contracts is recognized as services are performed 
additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the company has no further performance obligations 
the company has certain contracts that contain multiple deliverables  principally in the biopharma and bioproducts segments 
these deliverables often include process development services and commercial production and are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
for contracts that contain milestone based payments  the company recognizes revenue using the proportional performance method based on the percentage of costs incurred relative to the total costs estimated to be incurred to complete the contract 
revenue recognition computed under this methodology is compared to the amount of non refundable cash payments received or contractually receivable at the reporting date and the lesser of the two amounts is recognized as revenue at each reporting date 
the proportional performance methodology applied by the company  utilizes an input based measure  specifically labor costs  to determine proportional performance because the company believes the use of an input measure is a reasonable surrogate of proportional performance compared to an output based measure  such as milestones 
amounts billed in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet 
since payments received are non refundable  the termination of a contract by a customer prior to its completion could result in an immediate recognition of deferred revenue relating to payments already received not previously recognized as revenue 
sales terms to certain customers include remittance of discounts if certain conditions are met 
additionally  sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions 
the company estimates these rebates and estimated returns at the time of sale based on the terms of agreements with customers and historical experience and recognizes revenue net of these estimated costs which are classified as allowances and rebates 
asset valuations and review for potential impairments the review of long lived assets  principally fixed assets and other amortizable intangibles  requires the company to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows generated from these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
if undiscounted cash flows are less than carrying value  the long lived assets are written down to fair value 
dollars in thousands  except share data the review of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is done annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable utilizing a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting units is determined using a discounted cash flow model and compared to the carrying value 
if such analysis indicates that impairment may exist  the company then estimates the fair value of the other assets and liabilities utilizing appraisals and discounted cash flow analyses to calculate an impairment charge 
the determination of fair value is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including projected future cash flows primarily based on operating plans  discount rates  determination of appropriate market comparables and perpetual growth rates 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
environmental and litigation contingencies the company periodically assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for a discussion of our current environmental and litigation matters  reserves recorded and our position with respect to any related uncertainties 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  the company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that the company will incur an expense related to a settlement for such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
if probable and estimable  the company accrues for the costs of clean up  settlements and legal fees 
if the aggregate amount of the liability and the timing of the payment is fixed or reasonably determinable  the company discounts the amount to reflect the time value of money 
given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of litigation and environmental matters  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions that the company may have made with respect to their resolution 
income taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
the company s valuation allowances primarily relate to net operating loss carryforwards  foreign tax credits  and alternative minimum tax credits in the us  where profitability is uncertain and net operating loss carryforwards in certain state and foreign jurisdictions with little or no history of generating taxable income or where future profitability is uncertain 
employee benefit plans the company provides a range of benefits to employees and retired employees  including pensions  post retirement  post employment and health care benefits 
the company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations  which include various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost trend rates 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so 
the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods 
the company believes that the assumptions utilized for recording obligations under its plans are reasonable 
the discount rate used to measure pension liabilities and costs is selected by projecting cash flows associated with plan obligations which were matched to a yield curve of high quality bonds 
the company then selected the single rate that produces the same present value as if each cash flow were discounted by the corresponding spot rate on the yield curve

biopharma gross margins increased to in from in the improved margins are due primarily to higher revenues partially offset by higher production costs 
the human health segment gross sales in of  increased  or above human health sales were favorably impacted due to exchange rates reflecting a weaker us dollar 
the increase in sales is due mainly to stronger demand for certain central nervous system and cardiovascular apis  nicotine polacrilex resin used in smoking cessation products and higher sales of a diuretic api 
these sales were partially offset by lower sales of a gastrointestinal api  feed additives and a pharmaceutical intermediate used for end stage kidney treatment 
increasing pricing pressures on apis also negatively impacted sales 
human health gross margins decreased to in from in the reduced margins are due primarily to higher production costs  lower pricing on certain apis  and unfavorable impact of foreign currency partially offset by increased sales volume and favorable product mix 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses of  or of gross sales in increased from  or in administrative expenses increased primarily due to costs associated with the strategic alternative process  higher legal and audit fees  higher valuation of stock appreciation rights and the expensing of stock options partially offset by lower personnel costs

since  the company has maintained a full valuation allowance on the tax benefits arising from domestic pre tax losses 
the company recorded tax expense of  in the tax expense for includes a  valuation allowance to write down the carrying value of certain us tax assets that had been previously preserved by tax strategies 
this valuation allowance results from the company s recent history of domestic losses and its short term projections for continued domestic losses 
the company will continue to record a full valuation allowance on its domestic net deferred tax assets and indefinite lived intangibles until an appropriate level of domestic profitability is sustained or tax strategies can be developed that would enable the company to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of the domestic net deferred assets would be realized 
if the company continues to report pre tax losses in the united states  income tax benefits associated with those losses will not be recognized and  therefore  those losses would not be reduced by such income tax benefits 
the carryforward periods for foreign tax credits  research and experimentation tax credits  net operating losses  and the federal alternative minimum tax credits are years  years  years and an indefinite period  respectively 
as such  improvements in domestic pre tax income in the future may result in these tax benefits ultimately being realized 
however  there is no assurance that such improvements will be achieved

the human health segment gross sales in of  increased  or above human health sales were unfavorably impacted due to exchange rates reflecting a stronger us dollar 
the increase in sales is due mainly to stronger demand of a gastrointestinal api  nicotine polacrilex resin used in smoking cessation products  a pharmaceutical intermediate used for end stage kidney treatment and higher sales of a diuretic api 
these sales were partially offset by lower sales of certain central nervous system and cardiovascular apis due to increasing competition resulting in lower volumes sold and lower sales of a gastrointestinal api and crop additive 
human health gross margins decreased to in from in due primarily to higher production costs  lower pricing on certain apis  and unfavorable impact of foreign currency partially offset by favorable product mix and increased sales volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  or of gross sales in increased from  or in sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to additional sales and marketing personnel within the bioproducts segment

under the year agreement the interest rate options available to the company are the following i libor plus an applicable margin that ranges from 
to  ii higher of us prime rate or federal funds rate plus 
or iii money market rate as quoted by the administrative agent of the agreement 
the applicable margin is based upon the ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda as defined in the year agreement  leverage rates 
the company also pays a facility fee between

assuming financing can be arranged under favorable terms at anticipated levels  the company expects to distribute to per share as a special dividend to shareholders subsequent to arranging the financing 
management believes that existing sources of capital  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements 
a key to our access to liquidity is the maintenance of our long term credit ratings and ability to meet debt covenants to maintain certain levels of an interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio 
the company met all covenants related to the year agreement during as discussed in note  the company completed the sale of the businesses that comprise the bioproducts and biopharma segments on february  for total consideration of  and repaid the outstanding debt and retired the year agreement 
our forecasted cash flow from future operations may be adversely affected by various factors including  but not limited to  declines in customer demand  increased competition  the deterioration in general economic and business conditions  as well as other factors 
see the risk factors section of this document for further explanation of factors that may negatively impact our cash flows 
any change in the current status of these factors could adversely impact the company s ability to fund operating cash flow requirements 
dollars in thousands  except share data in connection with the sale of the bioproducts and biopharma businesses in february  the company will utilize domestic nol s and foreign tax credits for which a full valuation allowance was provided for at december  the nol s and foreign tax credits will be utilized to reduce significantly all the domestic tax on this transaction 
additionally it is anticipated that any us income tax related to the distribution from non us bioproducts entities repatriated subsequent to sale of those entities in first quarter will be offset by foreign tax credits 
market risks in the normal course of business  the company uses a variety of techniques and instruments  including derivatives  as part of its overall risk management strategy to lower its exposure to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
currency risk management the company s primary market risk relates to exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions entered into by international operations which are primarily denominated in the us dollar  euro and swedish krona 
the company currently uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of short term foreign exchange rate movements on the company s operating results 
the notional amount of these contracts as of december  was  unrealized foreign exchange contract losses do not subject the company s actual results to risk as gains or losses on these contracts are undertaken to offset gains or losses on the transactions that are hedged 
with respect to the contracts outstanding at december   a fluctuation of the local currency over a one year period would cause  pre tax earnings to be at risk 
this is based on the notional amount of the contracts  adjusted for unrealized gains and losses  of  these calculations do not include the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would offset the gains and losses of the derivative instruments 
interest rate management as of december   the company had borrowings of  that were based on short term variable interest rates in the year agreement 
contingencies the company is subject to various investigations  claims and legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities 
the company continually assesses all known facts and circumstances as they pertain to all legal and environmental matters and evaluates the need for reserves and disclosures as deemed necessary based on these facts and circumstances and as such facts and circumstances develop 
these matters  either individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  operating results and cash flows in a future reporting period 
environmental in connection with laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment  the company and or its subsidiaries is a party to several environmental proceedings and remediation investigations and cleanups and  along with other companies  has been named a potentially responsible party prp for certain waste disposal sites superfund sites 
additionally  as discussed in the sale of rutherford chemicals section of this note  the company has retained the liability for certain environmental proceedings  associated with the rutherford chemicals business 
each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these matters will be decided unfavorably against the company 
the resolution of such matters often spans several years and frequently involves regulatory oversight or adjudication 
dollars in thousands  except share data additionally  many remediation requirements are not fixed and are likely to be affected by future technological  site  and regulatory developments 
consequently  the ultimate extent of liabilities with respect to such matters  as well as the timing of cash disbursements cannot be determined with certainty 
in matters where the company has been able to reasonably estimate its liability  the company has accrued for the estimated costs associated with the study and remediation of superfund sites not owned by the company and the company s current and former operating sites 
these accruals were  and  at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in the accrual is primarily due to an increase in the reserve for several of the company s former operating sites of  an increase in the reserve at a company subsidiary with an offsetting receivable recorded in other assets of and currency fluctuation of  partially offset by payments of based upon currently available information and analysis  the company s current accrual represents management s best estimate of the probable and estimable costs associated with environmental proceedings including amounts for legal and investigation fees where remediation costs may not be estimable at the reporting date 
as a result of the sale of the bayonne  new jersey facility see sale of rutherford chemicals section of this note  an obligation to investigate site conditions and conduct required remediation under the new jersey industrial site recovery act was triggered and the company has retained the responsibility for such obligation 
the company completed a preliminary assessment of the site and submitted the preliminary assessment to the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep 
the preliminary assessment identified potential areas of concern based on historical operations and sampling of such areas commenced 
the company has completed a second phase of sampling and determined that a third phase of sampling is necessary to determine the extent of contamination and any necessary remediation 
the results of the completed and proposed sampling  and any additional sampling deemed necessary  will be used to develop an estimate of the company s future liability for remediation costs  if required 
the company submitted its plan for the third phase of sampling to the njdep during the fourth quarter of the sampling will commence upon approval of the sampling plan 
during the company increased reserves by to cover currently anticipated investigation and minimum remediation costs related to the site 
in march  the company completed the acquisition of the cambrex profarmaco landen facility in belgium 
at the time of acquisition  cambrex was aware of certain site contamination and recorded a reserve for the estimated costs of remediation 
as discussed in note  in october  the company completed the sale of the landen facility and the obligation related to the remediation of this site transferred to the new owner with the sale 
the company s cosan subsidiary conducted manufacturing operations in clifton  new jersey from until prior to the acquisition by the company  the operations were moved to another location and thereafter cambrex purchased the business 
in  cosan entered into an administrative consent order with the njdep 
under the administrative consent order  cosan was required to complete an investigation of the extent of the contamination related to the clifton site and conduct remediation as may be necessary 
during the third quarter of  the company completed the investigation related to the clifton site  which extends to adjacent properties 
the results of the investigation caused the company to increase its related reserves by  in based on the proposed remedial action plan 
the company submitted the results of the investigation and proposed remedial action plan to the njdep 
in late  the njdep requested that an additional investigation be conducted at the site 
the company expects to complete such additional work during the next several months 
in february  the new jersey federal district court ruled that a lawsuit claiming property damages against cosan by the owners of contaminated property adjacent to the clifton location could be placed on the active calendar 
to avoid the expense and uncertainty of trial  the parties have reached agreement to settle this matter 
a reserve of was recorded in march in july  under the settlement  cosan paid the property owner and this matter is considered concluded 
in march  the company received notice from the usepa that two former operating subsidiaries are considered prps at the berry s creek superfund site  bergen county  new jersey 
the operating companies are among many other prps that were listed in the notice 
pursuant to the notice  the prps have been asked to perform a dollars in thousands  except share data remedial investigation and feasibility study of the berry s creek site 
the company has met with the other prps 
both operating companies joined the groups of prps and filed a joint response to the usepa agreeing to jointly negotiate to conduct or fund along with other prps an appropriate remedial investigation and feasibility study of the berry s creek site 
at this time it is too early to predict the extent of any liabilities 
however  reserves have been established to cover anticipated initial costs related to the site 
the company is involved in other matters where the range of liability is not reasonably estimable at this time and it is not determinable when information will become available to provide a basis for recording an accrual  should an accrual ultimately be required 
litigation and other matters mylan laboratories in the company and its subsidiary profarmaco srl currently known as cambrex profarmaco milano srl profarmaco were named as defendants along with mylan laboratories  inc mylan and gyma laboratories of america  inc  profarmaco s distributor in the united states in a proceeding instituted by the federal trade commission ftc in the united states district court for the district of columbia the district court
