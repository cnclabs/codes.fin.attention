overview transmeta corporation develops and licenses innovative computing  microprocessor and semiconductor technologies and related intellectual property 
founded in  we first became known for designing  developing and selling our highly efficient x compatible software based microprocessors  which deliver a balance of low power consumption  high performance  low cost and small size suited for diverse computing platforms 
we are presently focused on developing and licensing our advanced power management technologies for controlling 
table of contents leakage and increasing power efficiency in semiconductor and computing devices  and in licensing our computing and microprocessor technologies to other companies 
from our inception in through our fiscal year ended december   our business model was focused primarily on designing  developing and selling highly efficient x compatible software based microprocessors 
since introducing our first family of microprocessor products in january  we derived the majority of our revenue from selling our microprocessor products 
in  we began diversifying our business model to establish a revenue stream based upon the licensing of certain of our intellectual property and advanced computing and semiconductor technologies 
although we believe that our products deliver a compelling balance of low power consumption  high performance  low cost and small size  we did not generate product revenue sufficient to sustain that line of business 
consequently  in we put most of our microprocessor products to end of life status and began modifying our business model to further leverage our intellectual property rights and to increase our business focus on licensing our advanced power management and other proprietary technologies to other companies  as well as to provide microprocessor design and engineering services 
in  we also entered into two significant and unrelated strategic alliance agreements with sony and microsoft  respectively  to leverage our microprocessor design and development capabilities by providing engineering services to other companies under contract 
during and  we pursued three significant lines of business licensing of intellectual property and technology  engineering services  and product sales 
in  we continued to derive significant revenue from our licensing of intellectual property and technologies 
in  we entered into and announced a commercial licensing and services agreement with toshiba corporation relating to our proprietary longrun technologies for advanced power management and transistor leakage control 
the toshiba licensing agreement is similar to our longrun licensing agreements with nec electronics  fujitsu limited and sony corporation 
those licensing agreements include deliverable based technology transfer fees  maintenance and service fees  and subsequent royalties on products incorporating the licensed technologies 
we intend to continue our efforts to license our advanced power management technologies to other companies  and we are also working to license our intellectual property and microprocessor and computing technologies to other companies 
we cannot assure you that in we will enter any additional licensing agreements or generate any royalties under our existing licensing agreements 
in  we also derived significant revenue from our performance of engineering services under our contracts with sony group and microsoft  but we completed the vast majority of that services work by the end of  and we expect to have successfully completed all of our services work under those agreements  on schedule  on or before march  the demand for our engineering services has been unpredictable and varied from quarter to quarter  and we experienced significant reductions in the demand for our engineering services in due to our completion of major programs and our customers declining needs for such services 
the billable time for our services engineers declined to the point where the cash generated by our services business was no longer sufficient to cover the costs associated with that business 
in spite of our successful execution on our services work  we determined that the high cost structure and low growth potential of our engineering services business is not consistent with our business model in therefore  we have decided not to pursue engineering services as a separate line of business 
accordingly  in february we initiated a restructuring plan to realign our headcount and expenses with our core business of licensing technology and intellectual property 
in  we derived only minimal product revenue from sales of our crusoe and efficeon microprocessor products  and we do not expect any additional product revenue from sales of those products in the future 
we placed our crusoe and nanometer efficeon products on end of life status in the first quarter of and supported our customer programs through the end of we continued to sell and support our nanometer efficeon microprocessor products in in june  we entered into an agreement with advanced micro devices  inc amd  providing for amd to distribute  on an exclusive basis worldwide  a special version of our nanometer efficeon microprocessor designed for microsoft s flexgo technology 
in  we built our inventory of nanometer efficeon products in anticipation of a ramp in demand resulting from the microsoft flexgo program  but our sales of nanometer efficeon products were minimal during and we have not received any production orders for our special flexgo enabled efficeon products 
accordingly  we recorded an inventory write down for our remaining nanometer efficeon products as of december  as part of the restructuring plan that we announced in february  we will have reduced our workforce and effectively ceased our operations relating to 
table of contents microprocessor production support as of march  as a consequence of these restructuring activities  we believe that we have exited the business of selling microprocessor products 
as a result of our operations  we reported total revenue of million  a million decrease compared to million for the year 
our total revenue decreased primarily due to a decrease in product revenue of million and license revenue of million  partially offset by an increase in service revenue of million 
as a percentage of total revenue  our overall gross margin was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was due to a decrease in product revenues and license revenues  partially offset by an increase in service revenues 
the decrease was also due to an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of relating to certain product inventory that had been built in anticipation of demand resulting from the microsoft flexgo program 
our product revenue decreased from million in to million in  with gross margins of and negative  respectively 
the decrease in our product revenue is primarily attributable to the depletion of our inventory of legacy microprocessor products that we put to end of life status in january our license revenue decreased from million to million  but gross margin for both years remain the same at 
the decrease in license revenue reflects the fact that we granted one new longrun license in as compared to two such licenses in our service revenues increased from million to million with a gross margin of in and in fiscal our total operating expenses were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in the company s total operating expenses was mainly due to a decrease in the selling and administrative costs resulting from a decrease of million in compensation and benefits  a decrease of million in temporary and contractual services  a decrease of million in salaries for research and development  a decrease of million in depreciation  a decrease of million in corporate insurance and a decrease of million in various selling and administrative items  offset by an increase of million in stock based compensation 
in fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million while we generated negative cash flows from operations of million 
this compares to fiscal in which we incurred a net loss of million and positive cash flows from operations of million 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances were million at december   as compared to million at december  as we announced publicly in february  we are streamlining and restructuring our operations to focus on our core business of developing and licensing intellectual property and technology 
under our current restructuring plan  we expect to reduce our overall operating expenses to align with our current intellectual property and technology licensing opportunities  and we believe that as a result of actions taken under that plan  our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations  planned capital and research and development expenditures through march  if we are unable to generate cash from operations sufficient to sustain our research and development activities at current levels  or to raise additional operating capital for that purpose  we believe that we would still be positioned to further reduce our research and development spending  to monetize certain of our technology or intellectual property assets  and to focus on licensing our intellectual property assets to other companies so as to continue operations for a period that extends at least through march  critical accounting policies the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of our management 
the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with management s understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of our accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgments on the part of management 
we believe the following critical accounting policies include the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements maintenance and technical support services revenue  fixed fee development service revenue and cost of services  and 
table of contents recognition of time and materials based design service revenue license and service revenue recognition  estimation of inventory valuations  stock based compensation valuation of long lived and intangible assets  restructuring charges  and loss contingencies  license and service revenue recognition 
we enter into technology and trademark license agreements  some of which may contain multiple elements  including technology licenses and support services  or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  interpretation on these agreements  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  is required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
we recognize revenue from license agreements when earned  which generally occurs when agreed upon deliverables are provided  customer acceptance criteria has been met  or milestones are met and accepted by licensees and relative fair values of multiple elements can be determined 
additionally  license  and maintenance and service revenues are recognized if collectibility is reasonably assured and if we are not subject to any future performance obligation 
royalty revenue is recognized upon receipt of royalty payments from customers 
service revenue is comprised of three sub types i maintenance and technical support services revenue  ii fixed fee development services revenue  and iii time and materials based design services revenue 
maintenance and technical support services revenue 
we offer maintenance and technical support services to our longrun licensees 
we recognize revenue from maintenance agreements based on the fair value of such agreements over the period in which such services are rendered 
technical support services are provided based on engineering time based on mutually agreed billing rates 
fixed fee development service revenue and cost of services 
in the first and second quarter of fiscal  we recognized our service revenue and the associated costs as the project was completed and we have met all of our obligations in connection with the engineering and development services and have obtained customer acceptance for all the deliverables 
recognition of time and materials based design services revenue and related costs 
beginning from the second quarter of fiscal  we began providing design and engineering services under a significant design services agreement to work on advanced third party technical projects 
we recognize revenues and related direct costs  consisting primarily of assigned staff compensation related costs  from service contracts using the time and materials method  as work is performed 
we charge the customer fees based on an agreed upon billing rate and the customers also reimburse us for agreed upon expenses 
estimation of inventory valuations 
our inventory valuation policy stipulates that we write down or write off our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory at the end of each reporting period 
the amount of the write down or write off is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value of the inventory based upon reasonable assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs or write offs may be required 
conversely  if demand for estimated excess or obsolete materials exceeds our original estimates  or the sales prices for previously written down materials are higher than anticipated  our gross margins would benefit to the extent that the associated revenue exceeds the material s adjusted value 
additionally  as we introduce product enhancements and new products  and improve our manufacturing processes  demand for our existing products in inventory may decrease 
inventory on hand in excess of forecasted demand is not valued 
in computing inventory valuation adjustments as a result of lower of cost or market considerations  we review not only 
table of contents the inventory on hand but also inventory in the supply chain pursuant to the non cancelable purchase orders 
if we become aware of factors that indicate that inventory associated with these non cancelable purchase orders will be sold to customers below its cost  we accrue such loss as an additional cost of revenue and as an additional accrued liability on the balance sheet 
consistent with this policy  we recorded charges of million for fiscals  and  respectively 
for fiscals and  the company s gross margins included an impairment charge on inventories of million in and a benefit of million in resulting from the sale of previously written down inventory 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  stock compensation expense for fiscal includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

stock compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after january  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
we recognize these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting term of four years for stock options 
through december   we accounted for stock based compensation related to employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
and have adopted the disclosure provisions of the statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation and sfas accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb had we accounted for stock based compensation related to employee stock based compensation plans using the fair value method as prescribed by sfas  our net loss would have been increased by million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
also see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab regarding the sec s interpretation of sfas no 
r and the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
we have applied the provisions of sab in the adoption of sfas no 
r 
stock compensation expense recorded in cost of revenue  research and development  and selling  general and administrative expenses is the amortization of the fair value of share based payments made to employees and members of our board of directors  primarily in the form of stock options as we adopted the provision of sfas no 
r on january  see note summary of significant accounting policies stock based compensation 
all of our stock compensation is accounted for as an equity instrument 
we account for stock compensation costs in accordance with sfas no 
r and apply the provisions of sab we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of employee stock compensation awards  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected volatility and expected life 
historical and implied volatility were used in estimating the fair value of our stock compensation awards  while the expected life for our options was estimated based on historical trends 
further  as required under sfas no 
r  we now estimate forfeitures for stock compensation awards that are not expected to vest 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our stock compensation 
we charge the estimated fair value to earnings on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying awards  which is generally four years for our stock option awards 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
as our stock option awards have characteristics that differ significantly from traded options  and as changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  our estimate of fair value may not accurately represent the value assigned by a third party in an arms length transaction 
there currently is no market based mechanism to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates derived from the black scholes option pricing model or other allowable valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
while our estimate of fair value and the associated charge to earnings materially affects our results of operations  it has no impact on our cash position 

table of contents the guidance in sfas no 
r and sab is relatively new and the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and guidance 
there are significant variations among allowable valuation models  and there is a possibility that we may adopt a different valuation model or refine the inputs and assumptions under our current valuation model in the future resulting in a lack of consistency in future periods 
our current or future valuation model and the inputs and assumptions we make may also lack comparability to other companies that use different models  inputs  or assumptions  and the resulting differences in comparability could be material 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we measured compensation expense for stock compensation made to our employee and members of our board of directors  primarily in the form of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  using the intrinsic value method provided by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we applied the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosures as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense 
we recorded employee stock compensation expense prior to fiscal for options granted to employees with an exercise price less than the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
on november   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff accounting position no 
fas r transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
we have elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of the employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas no 
r 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
our policy for the valuation and impairment of long lived assets stipulates that  at the end of each accounting period or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we evaluate our long lived and intangible assets for impairment 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the future cash flows the asset is considered to be impaired and the impairment charge recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
during the fourth quarter of and the fourth quarter of  consistent with this policy  we recorded impairment charges of million and million respectively  related to certain long lived and other assets associated with our product sales 
we continue to periodically evaluate our long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas and acknowledge it is at least possible that such evaluation might result in future adjustments for impairment 
such an impairment might adversely affect our operating results 
determining the expected future cash flows requires management to make significant estimates 
we base our estimates on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from these estimates 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  it could result in lower estimated future cash flows that may not support the current carrying value of these assets  which would require us to record impairment charges for these assets 
restructuring charges 
in fiscal  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  we accrued for restructuring costs when we made a commitment to a firm exit plan that specifically identified all significant actions to be taken in conjunction with our response to a change in our strategic plan  product demand  increased costs or other environmental factors 
as part of the restructuring plan  we recorded restructuring charges of million primarily related to lease costs and equipment write offs 
we recorded restructuring charges of million related to a reduction in workforce during the third quarter of fiscal our assumptions used in determining the estimation of restructuring expenses include the determination of the period that it will take to sublet our vacated premises  the market price that we would be able to command for the subleased space and the interest rate used to determine the present value of our future lease obligations 
any significant variation in these estimates compared to actual results may have a material impact on our restructuring expenses and 
table of contents our operating results 
we reassess the restructuring accruals on a quarterly basis to reflect changes in the costs of the restructuring activities 
the most significant variables of our accrued restructuring costs are the period that it will take to sublet our vacated premises and the market price at which we believe that we will be able to sublet our vacated facilities 
for example  if it is determined that the rate for which we are able to sublease our vacated space is less than our assumed rate  our restructuring charges could significantly increase as a result 
additionally  if it takes longer than expected to sublease our vacated space  additional restructuring charges may be incurred 
when reassessing our estimates  we incorporate the most recently available industry data regarding relevant occupancy and lease cost rates 
we have found that these variables are often difficult to predict as there are many uncertainties related to the commercial real estate market in which we are attempting to sublet our vacated facilities 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adjusted the balance in our accrued restructuring costs and recorded a recovery of million of previously recorded restructuring charges 
this adjustment was the result of an update in assumptions regarding the company s internal use of previously vacated office space  as well as the anticipated length of time before our vacated facilities are sublet to others 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we adjusted the balance in our accrued restructuring costs and recorded a charge of million to restructuring charges 
this adjustment was the result of an update to certain underlying assumptions regarding the sublease of our vacant facilities in future periods 
the assumption had been revised such that we no longer assume that we will be able to sublease our previously vacated space that remained unused as of september  during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million and million  related to a workforce reduction and excess facilities  respectively 
we also recorded a restructuring recovery of million related to the reoccupation of certain excess facilities previously restructured 
during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to excess facilities 
loss contingencies 
we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the normal course of business 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we accrue for a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount of loss 
we regularly assess current information available to determine whether changes in such accruals are required 
description of operating accounts total revenue 
total revenue currently consists of product sales  net of returns and allowances  and revenue from licensing and services agreements 
costs of products 
cost of products consists of the costs of manufacturing  assembly and testing of our silicon chips  and compensation and associated costs related to manufacturing support  logistics and quality assurance personnel 
cost of products may additionally include a component for adjustments to the valuation of certain inventories based on lower demand and average selling prices expected in future periods 
costs of services 
costs of services is comprised mainly of compensation and benefits of engineers assigned directly to the projects  hardware and software  and other computer support 
cost of services also includes the costs of providing services under the maintenance agreements with the licenses of our power management and other technologies 
gross margin 
gross margin is the percentage derived from dividing gross profit by revenue 
our gross margin each quarter is affected by a number of factors  including license revenue recognized  competitive pricing  mix  foundry pricing  yields  production flow costs  speed distribution of our products and impairment charges 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead costs associated with employees engaged in research  design and development activities for products and related technologies  as well as the cost of masks  wafers and other materials and related test services and equipment used in the development process 
selling  general administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related overhead costs for sales  marketing and administrative personnel and legal and accounting services 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges resulted from our decision in and to cease development and production of a previous generation of microprocessors 
the restructuring charges consisted primarily of lease costs  employee severance and termination costs  equipment write offs and other costs 

table of contents amortization of patents and patent rights 
these charges primarily relate to various patents and patent rights acquired from seiko epson and others during fiscal impairment charge on long lived and other assets 
the impairment charge on long lived and other assets was recorded in fiscal after the restructuring in the fourth quarter of fiscal as well as in fiscal after the emergence of indicators of impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the expected negative operating margin related to the company s product sales 
this led to the recording of an impairment charge for assets for which the carrying amount exceeded their fair value 
stock compensation 
there were two components to stock compensation expense during these periods 
the first component is the amortization of deferred stock compensation associated with options granted prior to november  net of cancellations 
the second component is the application of variable accounting for certain stock option grants 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we did not enforce the recourse provisions of certain employee notes associated with option exercises 
therefore  we account for all other outstanding notes as if they had terms equivalent to non recourse notes  even though the terms of these notes were not in fact changed from recourse to non recourse 
as a result  we have and will continue to record adjustments related to variable stock option accounting on the associated stock awards until the notes are paid 
this variable stock compensation charge is based on the excess  if any  of the current market price of our stock as of the period end over the purchase price of the stock award  adjusted for vesting and prior stock compensation expense recognized on the stock award 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net consist of primarily the interest income on our average cash balances over a given period of time  and a gain from an early extinguishment of a debt from a development partner 
interest expense 
interest expense is primarily based on interest payments to a development partner  and to a lesser extent  the accretion of long term property lease obligations related to office space that was vacated as part of our and restructuring

product revenues consist of sale of x compatible software based microprocessors 
license revenues consist of deliverable based technology transfer fees from licensing advanced power management and other proprietary technologies 
service revenues consist of design services and development services fees received for either fixed fee or time and materials based engineering services  as well as maintenance support fees 
total revenue  which includes product  license and service revenue is presented in the following table total revenue for the comparative periods is summarized in the following table years ended december  in thousands product license service total revenue 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal total revenue was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease in our product revenue is primarily attributable to the depletion of our inventory of legacy microprocessor products that we put to end of life status in january the decrease in license revenue reflects the fact that we granted one new longrun technology license in as compared to two such licenses in product revenues 
product revenue of million for fiscal represents a million decrease over product revenue in fiscal the decline was primarily attributable to the depletion of our inventory of legacy products that we put to end of life status in january license revenue 
license revenue of million during fiscal represents recognition of license fees related to technology transfers made to our fourth customer pursuant to one of our longrun technology license agreements 
the million decline in license revenue from reflects the fact that we granted one new longrun license in as compared to two such licenses in service revenue 
service revenue is comprised of three sub types i maintenance and technical support services revenue  ii fixed fee development services revenue  and iii time and materials based design services revenue 
service revenues increased significantly from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase in service revenue was primarily attributable to the fixed fee development service revenue recognized in the first quarter of deferred income related to services was zero at december  we recognized all service income in the year years ended december  in thousands fixed fee development service time materials based contract maintenance and technical support service other total services revenue fixed fee development service revenue and cost of services 
in the first and second quarter of fiscal  we recognized our service revenue and the associated costs as the project was completed and we have met all of our obligations in connection with the engineering and development services and have obtained customer acceptance for all the deliverables 
time and materials based design service revenue 
beginning from the second quarter of fiscal  we began providing design and engineering services under a significant design services agreement to work on advanced third party technical projects 
we recognize the service revenue and related direct cost of service  the latter consisting primarily of assigned staff compensation related costs  using the time and materials method  as work is performed 
as noted above  in prior periods  we recorded the relatively immaterial time and materials based service revenue under the license and service revenue caption 
maintenance and technical support services revenue 
we offer maintenance and technical support services to our longrun licensees 
we recognize revenue from maintenance agreements based on the fair value of such agreements over the period in which such services are rendered 
technical support services are provided based on engineering time  and the fees are based on mutually agreed billing rates 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenue was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal our revenues increased substantially during fiscal as we modified our business model during the first quarter of to increase our business focus on licensing our advanced power management  to provide microprocessor design and engineering services  and lessen our historical focus on designing  developing  and selling x compatible microprocessor products 
further  as part of the modification of our business model during the first half of  we have entered into two significant strategic alliance agreements with other 
table of contents companies to leverage our intellectual property rights and our microprocessor design and development capabilities  to realize value from certain of our legacy microprocessor products 
product revenues 
in both fiscals and  our product revenues consist of two product groups the older crusoe chip product line and the newer efficeon chip line 
product revenue increased by million in fiscal over fiscal the increase was due in part to an unexpected increase in demand from customers who received notice of our intention to discontinue certain products and to substantially raise the average selling prices asps on certain other products 
in addition  we experienced higher revenues in fiscal as a result of higher unit shipments and asps of efficeon products  which had their first full year of sales in fiscal revenue from efficeon products represented million of total product revenue in fiscal  versus million of total product revenue in fiscal higher unit shipments on slightly lower asps of crusoe product  our first product line 
revenue from crusoe products represented million of total product revenue in fiscal  versus million of total product revenue in fiscal license revenue 
license revenue of million was recognized during fiscal  which represent recognition of license fees related to technology transfers made to our second and third customer pursuant to one of our longrun license agreements 
the license revenue in fiscal represents recognition of license fees related to technology transfers made to our first customer pursuant to one of our longrun license agreements 
service revenue 
service revenue is comprised of three sub types i maintenance and technical support services revenue  ii fixed fee development services revenue  and iii time and materials based design services revenue 
service revenues increased significantly to million in fiscal  versus million in fiscal this increase in service revenue was attributable to our microprocessor design services beginning in the second quarter of with the sony group 
as part of our modified business model announced march   we deployed the majority of our engineering headcount in design and development services arrangements 
on march   we entered into a design services agreement with sony computer entertainment inc and sony corporation collectively  the sony group  under which agreement we currently provide the design and engineering services of approximately one hundred and forty transmeta engineers to work on advanced projects for sony group 
the term of this design services agreement extends to march   however  the services we provide are agreed upon pursuant to specific project agreements with terms of one year or less 
our current project agreements expire by their terms on march   corresponding to sony group s fiscal year end 
we expect to continue to provide services to the sony group until march   and we are negotiating project agreements with the sony group respecting such services 
however  due to the uncertainty of these negotiations  we cannot assure you that we will extend any of the current project agreements or enter any additional project agreements  or that such agreements  if any  will continue to require engineering services of the same kind or at the same level as we provided in years ended december  in thousands time materials based contract maintenance technical support services for license total services revenue maintenance and technical support services revenue we offer maintenance and technical support services to our longrun licensees

customer concentration information we have derived the majority of our revenue from a limited number of customers 
additionally  we derive a significant portion of our revenue from customers located in asia  which subjects us to economic cycles in that region as well as the geographic areas in which they sell their products containing our microprocessors 
the following table represents our sales to customers  each of which is located in asia  that accounted for more than of total revenue for fiscals  and years ended december  customer sony corporation fujitsu america inc hewlett packard international pte inc microsoft nec electronics corp

in fiscal  inventories were written down to zero at the close of a fiscal period 
we recorded a benefit to product gross margin of approximately million for fiscal and million for the fiscal the million benefit to gross margin during fiscal was associated with the sale of inventory that was previously reserved 
fiscal compared to fiscal as a percent of product revenue  our cost of product revenue was for fiscal  compared to in fiscal the significant decreases in our cost of product revenue in fiscal versus fiscal were primarily attributed to benefit derived from sale of previously written down inventory during fiscal from customers  lower product cost a result of lower manufacturing costs associated with the efficeon tm processors  which had higher costs with the introduction of the product in fiscal  higher charges for inventory adjustments in fiscal resulted from manufacturing costs expected to exceed the price at which we expected to sell these products 
product gross margins were in fiscal compared to negative in fiscal as previously discussed  positive gross margins were achieved through a combination of higher benefits from previously written down inventories  higher asp  lower manufacturing costs and higher product demand due to end of life orders 
in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million to costs of revenue related to the valuation of inventory on hand  which resulted in a reduction of the carrying value of that inventory 
as a component of this charge and in computing inventory valuation adjustments as a result of lower of costs or market considerations  we review the inventory on hand and inventory on order 
in estimating the net realizable value of the inventory on hand and in determining whether the inventory on hand was in excess of anticipated demand  we took into consideration current assumptions regarding our future plans on its products and the related potential impact on customer demand and average selling prices 
inventories written down to net realizable value at the close of a fiscal period are not marked up in subsequent periods 
of the million and million of net inventory on hand at december  and  respectively  zero and million of net inventory  respectively  were adjusted to their net realizable value 

table of contents for fiscal  we experienced an unexpected increase in demand for this previously written down inventory from customers who received notice of our intention to discontinue certain products and to substantially raise the asps on many of our products 
we recorded a benefit to gross margin from the sale of previously written down inventory of approximately million for fiscal and million for the fiscal the million benefit to gross margin during fiscal included a million in sales to one customer of inventory that had been written down as of december   but was sold during fiscal  because of favorable changes in that customer s product specification requirements  and b million associated with the sale of inventory that was improperly written down in the fourth quarter of fiscal we do not expect to realize additional gross margin benefit in future periods from the sale of such improperly written down inventory 
gross margin may be impacted from future sales of other previously written down inventory to the extent that the associated revenue exceeds or fails to achieve the currently adjusted value of that inventory  although the amount is expected to be diminimus

as part of our quarterly reassessment of restructuring accruals  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adjusted the accrued restructuring balance as a result of an update in assumptions regarding our internal use of previously vacated office space  as well as the anticipated length of time before vacated facilities are sublet to others 
as a result of this update  we adjusted the balance in accrued restructuring costs and recorded a benefit of million to restructuring charges 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we adjusted our accrued restructuring costs as a result of an update to certain underlying assumptions 
we had previously anticipated subleasing our vacant facilities in future periods 
in view of market conditions  this assumption had been revised such that we no longer assume that we will be able to sublease our previously vacated space that remained unused as of september  as a result of this update in assumptions  we adjusted the accrued restructuring costs and recorded a charge of million in restructuring charges

amortization charges relate to various patents and patent rights acquired from seiko epson and others during fiscal also included in the amortization charges are accretion expenses associated with the liability recorded from the acquisition of these patents and patent rights 
the decreases can be attributed to a decrease in accretion expenses  as the liabilities associated with the patents and patent rights have been either paid in full or accreted to its future value as of december  impairment charge on long lived and other assets during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million related to long lived and other assets associated with the product business and was comprised of million for property and equipment and million for software maintenance prepayments 
during the fourth quarter of  due to the emergence of indicators of impairment  we performed an assessment of our long lived and other assets 
the assessment was performed in connection with our internal policies and pursuant to sfas the conclusion of the assessment was that the carrying value of certain assets was in excess of their expected future undiscounted cash flows 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million in to write off such assets based on the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets exceeded their fair value  which was deemed to be zero and was based on the expected future discounted cash flows for the company s product sales

fiscal compared to fiscal stock compensation was negative  for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the two components of stock compensation were the amortization of deferred stock compensation and variable stock compensation 
net amortization of deferred stock compensation for fiscal was none compared to million for fiscal this decrease was primarily a result of amortizing the deferred charge on an accelerated method in accordance with our accounting policy 
the amortization of the deferred stock compensation  calculated in connection with stock options granted prior to november  was completed in fiscal variable stock compensation for fiscal was negative  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in the variable stock compensation component in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily resulted from a higher repayment amount of notes from which such variable stock accounting is applied  as well as a lower market price of our stock as of december  compared to the same period in the prior year

liquidity and capital resources for the fiscal year ended december   we had negative cash flows from our operations 
except for the second  third and fourth quarters of  we have historically reported negative cash flows from our operations because the gross profit  if any  generated from our product revenues and our license and service revenues has not been sufficient to cover our operating cash requirements 
from our inception in through fiscal year  we incurred a cumulative loss aggregating million  which included net losses of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  which losses have reduced stockholders equity to million at december  at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal  and see the financial statements in item for complete statements of cash flows for those periods 
years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents we believe that if we were to continue under the business model that we pursued during and through our fiscal year ended december   our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances and cash from operations would not be sufficient to fund our operations  planned capital and r d expenditures for the next twelve months in all three of our significant lines of business licensing of intellectual property and technology  engineering services  and product sales 
accordingly  and as we announced publicly in february  we are streamlining and restructuring our operations to focus on our core business of developing and licensing intellectual property and technology 
in february  we began the initial phase of our restructuring plan by decreasing our worldwide workforce by approximately employees  most of whom worked in our engineering services business  and by initiating closures of our offices in taiwan and japan 
we expect to further reduce our workforce by approximately employees on or about march   as we complete our existing engineering services work for sony and microsoft 
under our current restructuring plan  we expect to reduce our overall operating expenses to align with our current intellectual property and technology licensing opportunities  and we believe that if our actions taken under that plan are successful  our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations  planned capital and r d expenditures through march  if we are unable to generate cash from operations sufficient to sustain our r d activities at current levels  or to raise additional operating capital for that purpose  we believe that we would still be positioned to further reduce our r d spending  to monetize certain of our technology or intellectual property assets  and to focus on licensing our intellectual property assets to other companies so as to continue operations for a period that extends at least through march  
table of contents the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern  however  the above conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
in addition to the restructuring plan referred to above  we are currently engaged in discussions with other companies regarding certain potential strategic alliance opportunities that could enable us to leverage our technologies  to raise operating capital and to improve or enhance our business in other ways 
although it is possible that we might raise additional operating capital or create new prospects by means of one or more strategic alliances with other companies  we have no assurance that we will achieve any such strategic alliance or that any such strategic alliance  if achieved  will prove favorable for us or our business 
to date  we have financed our operational expenses and working capital requirements primarily with funds that we raised from the sale of our common stock 
although it is possible that we might raise additional capital by means of one or more strategic alliances  or through public or private equity or debt financing  we have no assurance that any additional funds will be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
if additional funds were to be raised through the sale of equity securities  additional dilution to the existing stockholders would be likely to result 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the net cash usage for operating activities during fiscal was primarily the result of a net loss of million  as well as million cash usage related to the building leasehold cost component of our restructuring charges 
the usage in cash was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
the net loss and changes in operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by non cash charges related to amortization of patents and patent rights of million  amortization of stock compensation of million  depreciation of million and non cash restructuring charges of million  partially offset by decreases in advances from customers of million and deferred income of million 
the net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was primarily the result of non cash charges related to amortization of patents and patent rights of million  restructuring charges of million and depreciation of million  advances from customers of million and deferred income of million as well as decreases in inventories and accounts receivable of million and million  respectively 
this provision in cash was partially offset by a million of net loss  a million of cash usage related to the workforce reduction and building leasehold cost component of our restructuring charges and a decrease of million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities

investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  and to net cash used by investing activities of million for the year ended december  the change in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the purchase of available for sale investments of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively

payments made for previously acquired patents and patent rights were  and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we received million in net proceeds from sales of common stock under our employee stock purchase and stock option plans for fiscal  compared to million and million for fiscals and  respectively 
these proceeds from stock issuances were partially offset by payments for debt and capital lease obligations of zero for fiscal  compared to million for fiscals and  respectively 
the decrease in payments for debt and capital lease obligations was primarily the result of the expiration of these leases in fiscal in addition  cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was primarily due to net proceeds from the public offering of common stock 
in january  we received million when our underwriters exercised their over allotment option in relation to our december common stock offering and purchased million shares of our common stock 
we also received million in november when we completed a public offering of million shares of common stock 
since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  from lease financing 
it is reasonably possible that we may continue to seek financing through these sources of capital as well as other types of financing  including but not limited to debt financing 
additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
we lease our facilities under non cancelable operating leases expiring in  and we lease equipment and software under non cancelable leases expiring in fiscal contractual obligations at december   we had the following contractual obligations payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years in thousands operating leases unconditional purchase obligations less sublease income total purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on transmeta and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  or sab sab is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november  and addresses how financial statement errors should be considered from a materiality perspective and corrected 
the literature provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
historically  there have been two approaches commonly used to quantify such errors i the rollover approach  which quantifies the error as the amount by which the current year income statement is misstated  and ii the iron curtain approach  which quantifies the error as the cumulative amount by which the current year balance sheet is misstated 
the sec staff believes that companies should quantify errors using both approaches and evaluate whether either of these approaches results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material
