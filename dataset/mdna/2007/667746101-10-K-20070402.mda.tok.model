overview we are a leading north american manufacturer of large diameter  high pressure steel pipeline systems for use in water infrastructure applications  primarily related to drinking water systems 
our pipeline systems are also used for hydroelectric power systems  wastewater systems and other applications 
we also make products for industrial plant piping systems and certain structural applications 
these pipeline systems are produced by our water transmission group from five manufacturing facilities strategically located across the united states in portland  oregon  denver  colorado  adelanto  california  parkersburg  west virginia  and saginaw  texas 
our water transmission group accounted for approximately of net sales in our tubular products group operates two manufacturing facilities in atchison  kansas  and houston  texas and produces a range of products used in several different markets 
we currently make energy pipe  fire protection sprinkler pipe  agricultural pipe  traffic signpost systems and standard pipe that is sold to distributors and used in many different applications 
our tubular products group generated approximately of our net sales in our fabricated products group generated the remaining of our net sales in our fabricated products group primarily produces propane tanks for distribution in rural and suburban areas of the united states 
these tanks range in size from gallons to  gallons 
all of these products are produced at our monterrey  mexico facility 
recently  we completed an expansion of this facility that should double its capacity 
the new production lines are targeted towards manufacturing other steel or aluminum pressure vessels and fabricated parts 
we have a number of projects in the prototype or trial order stages that are targeted to the energy  transportation and water industries 
our water infrastructure products are sold generally to installation contractors  who include our products in their bids to municipal agencies or privately owned water companies for specific projects 
we believe our sales are substantially driven by spending on new water infrastructure with a recent trend towards spending on water infrastructure replacement  repair and upgrade 
within the total pipeline  our products tend to fit the larger diameter  higher pressure applications 
we believe  because of our reputation for quality  our long relationships and our breadth of product offerings  our products are generally included in most projects for which the pipe falls within our manufacturing strengths 

table of contents our tubular products group s sales volume is typically driven by non residential construction spending  energy  highway spending and general economic conditions 
in we began to shift the focus of our tubular products group on products for which we believe we have a sustainable advantage and to reduce our reliance on products which are very susceptible to import competition 
this strategy resulted in lower volume in  but in we were able to increase this group s sales through growth in energy products 
overall demand for our fabricated products group s propane tanks is primarily driven by weather patterns and residential heating needs  construction activity  and general economic conditions 
our new products  if they develop as expected  will be sold to oems in the transportation  energy and water industries 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
management estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate all of our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranties  intangible assets  accrued liabilities  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from construction contracts in our water transmission segment is recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of total costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs of each contract 
estimated total costs of each contract are reviewed on a monthly basis by project management and operations personnel for all projects that are fifty percent or more complete except that major projects  usually over million  are reviewed earlier if sufficient production has been completed to provide enough information to revise the original estimated total cost of the project 
all cost revisions that result in the gross profit as a percent of sales increasing or decreasing by greater than one percent are reviewed by senior management personnel 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and depreciation 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
provisions for losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period such losses are known 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
historically  actual results have been within management s estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue from our tubular products and fabricated products segments is recognized when all four of the following criteria have been satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and from contract disputes 
the extension and revision of credit is established by obtaining credit 
table of contents rating reports or financial information of a potential customer 
trade receivable balances are evaluated at least monthly 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us as a result of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s financial position  contract dispute  product claim or other similar events  a specific allowance is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the expected recovery amount given all information presently available 
a general allowance is recorded for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with individual customers 
as of december   the accounts receivable balance of million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of  we believe the reported allowances at december   are adequate 
if the customers financial conditions were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may need to be recorded  which would result in additional selling  general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
historically  actual results have been within management s estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the assigned value of the net assets in connection with all acquisitions 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we review for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit that includes goodwill  as measured by discounted cash flows  market multiples based on earnings  and other valuation methodologies  to the carrying value 
as required under sfas  we performed our annual assessment for impairment of the goodwill as of december   based on our analysis  we believe no impairment of goodwill exists 
long lived assets property and equipment are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the disposal of long lived assets 
we assess impairment of property and equipment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
the recoverable value of long lived assets is determined by estimating future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  or changes to our business operations 
if we determine the carrying value of the property and equipment will not be recoverable  we calculate and record an impairment loss 
effective january   we elected to change our accounting method related to depreciation of certain equipment from the straight line method of depreciation to the units of production method of depreciation  which is considered a preferable method of accounting for such long lived  nonfinancial assets 
we have determined this change to be preferable under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states as it more accurately reflects the pattern of consumption of the equipment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
 this change  accounted for as a change in estimate effected by a change in accounting principle  has been applied prospectively 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
finished goods and tubular products and fabricated products raw material are stated at cost using the first in  first out method of accounting 
raw material inventories of steel coil are stated at cost on a specific identification 
raw material inventories of coating and lining materials  as well as materials and supplies  are stated on an average cost basis 

table of contents product warranties our standard terms and conditions of sale include a warranty for our products to be free of certain defects 
we record a general reserve for warranty claims based on historical experience 
if actual warranty claims differ from our estimates  revisions to the reserve would be necessary 
income taxes we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted income tax rates 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
self insurance we are self insured for a portion of losses and liabilities associated with workers compensation claims at our west virginia facility 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using historical experience and certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
we have purchased stop loss coverage in order to limit  to the extent practical  the aggregate exposure to claims 
there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences 
pension benefits we have two defined benefit pension plans that are frozen 
we fund these plans to cover current plan costs plus amortization of the unfunded plan liabilities 
to record these obligations  management uses estimates relating to assumed inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover  and discount rates 
management  along with third party actuaries  reviews all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial information regarding costs and expenses expressed as a percentage of total net sales and net sales of our business segments 
year ended december  net sales water transmission tubular products fabricated products total net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses gain on sale of assets operating income interest expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income segment gross profit as a percentage of net sales water transmission tubular products fabricated products 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in no single customer accounted for or more of total net sales in or water transmission sales increased to million in from million in net sales increased over the same period last year as a result of increased volume  which is attributable to stronger demand that began in the second quarter of and continued through the end of in addition to increased sales  the stronger demand resulted in a record backlog at december  of million  as compared to the backlog of million at the beginning of bidding activity  backlog and sales resulting from the award of new projects  or the production of current projects  may vary significantly from period to period 
tubular products sales increased to million in from million in the majority of the increase in net sales over last year resulted from improved energy product sales 
fabricated products sales increased to million in from million in the increase in net sales was a result of increased demand for our propane tank products in the first nine months of the year  offset slightly by a drop in demand in the last quarter of gross profit 
gross profit increased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in water transmission gross profit decreased slightly to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in our water transmission gross profit and our gross profit as a percent of segment net sales decreased as a result of product mix 
unlike  where the market was strong in the first half of the year and began to soften in the second half of  saw a continuation of a relatively slower market though much of the first half of and then a strengthening in the second half of historically  during periods of slow or slowing markets  we see a much more competitive bidding environment 
as a result  the projects that were booked during the later part of and through much of the first half of were at lower margins and the majority of these projects were produced in gross profit from tubular products increased to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in our tubular products gross margin percentage increased from the same period last year primarily because of the shift from products that competed directly with imported tubing  to products that we believe have a sustainable competitive market advantage 
fabricated products gross profit decreased to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in fabricated products gross profit decreased over the same period last year due to lower volume in the fourth quarter and the inability to pass on the higher cost of steel to our customers in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in the majority of the increase resulted from an increase in incentive compensation and the expensing of stock options that was required beginning on january  gain on the sale of assets 
on may   we completed the sale of our manufacturing facility in riverside  california  included in assets held for sale at december  a gain of million was recorded 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased from million in to million in the decrease in interest expense resulted from lower average outstanding borrowings 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate was approximately in and in the effective tax rates in and were lower than historical effective rates 
the decrease in our effective tax rate was 
table of contents mainly due to research and development tax credits that were recorded on amended income tax returns 
the decrease in our effective tax rate was due to changes in section manufacturing deductions  changes in state apportionment factors  and the resolution of previously uncertain tax matters 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in no single customer accounted for or more of total net sales in or water transmission sales increased to million in from million in net sales increased over the same period in as a result of increased volume  which was attributable to stronger demand 
our water transmission business is impacted by infrastructure improvements  as municipal water agencies initiate improvements  we generally experience an increase in demand for our products 
in addition to increased sales  the stronger demand resulted in a consistently strong backlog at december  of million  as compared to the backlog of million at the beginning of tubular products sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease in net sales over the same period in was expected  as the strong market conditions experienced in could not be sustained 
volume decreased in as we focused our efforts on products we believed offered the opportunity for sustainable profitability  and did not directly compete with low cost imports 
fabricated products sales increased to million in from million in the increase in net sales was attributable to improved demand  which allowed for an increase in sales prices  and a small increase in market share 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in water transmission gross profit increased to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in our water transmission gross profit improved as our production continued to be strong throughout the year  and we were able to take advantage of consistent higher plant utilization 
gross profit from tubular products decreased to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in our tubular products gross margin percentage decreased from the same period in primarily because  as selling prices stabilized  our cost of goods sold increased because of high cost steel  which reduced our margin 
fabricated products gross profit increased to million of segment net sales in from  of segment net sales in fabricated products gross profit increased over the same period in due to increased volume combined with better productivity in our operations  and higher selling prices during as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in while the increase was consistent with the increase in sales  specific factors affecting the increase in expenses included an increase in incentive compensation  and an increase in information systems costs due to our system upgrade completed in interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in both our outstanding borrowings and the rates on those borrowings 

table of contents income taxes 
our effective tax rate was approximately in and in the decrease in our effective tax rate was due to changes in section manufacturing deductions  changes in state apportionment factors  and the resolution of previously uncertain tax matters 
liquidity and capital resources we generally finance our operations through cash flows from operations and available borrowings 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and available borrowings of million 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million 
this was primarily the result of our net income of million  non cash adjustments for depreciation and amortization of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  offset by non cash adjustments for the deferred gain on sale leaseback of equipment and a gain from the sale of property and equipment of and million  respectively  and an increase in inventories of million and an increase in trade and other receivables  net of million 
the increase in inventories and accounts payable resulted primarily from an increase in steel shipments from our vendors at the end of to support the increase in the production of our water transmission group 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  which resulted from paying off the majority of our operating leases with resultant additions of property and equipment  offset by million in proceeds  primarily from the sale of the riverside property and equipment in may of net cash provided by financing activities in was million  which primarily resulted from proceeds of million from a follow on stock offering that was completed in november and option exercises  net payments of million on our long term debt agreements and million net borrowings on our line of credit to a financial institution

the following table sets forth our commitments under the terms of our debt obligations and operating leases total thereafter credit agreement the notes the term notes capital leases operating leases interest payments total obligations these amounts represent future interest payments related to our debt obligations  excluding the credit agreement 
we also have entered into stand by letters of credit that total approximately million as of december  the stand by letters of credit relate to customer owned material  workers compensation and general liability insurance 
due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience  we do not expect to make any significant payments under these arrangements

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify 
table of contents financial statement misstatements 
traditionally  there have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements the roll over method and the iron curtain method 
the roll over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement  including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements  but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact that the adoption of sab had on our financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas requires companies to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy ie  levels   and  as defined 
additionally  companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the level category  including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities

in addition  for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis  an entity should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented if those amounts are significant 
the provisions of eitf should be applied to financial reports for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   with earlier adoption permitted

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we transact business in various foreign countries  and from time to time settle our transactions in foreign currencies 
we have established a program that utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures 
these forward contracts are not used for trading or for speculative purposes 
our foreign currency exposures typically arise from sales contracts denominated in canadian currency  for which there is exposure associated with potential foreign currency rate changes occurring between the contract date and the date when the payments are received 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the forward contracts  to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
we have six foreign exchange agreements agreements at december   which were for an original amount of million  of which million was still open 
net foreign exchange transaction gains losses included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were not material for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we believe our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements to be de minimis 
we are exposed to cash flow and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to certain portions of our debt 
the debt subject to changes in interest rates is our million revolving credit line million outstanding as of december  
management believes our current risk exposure to interest rate movements to be immaterial
