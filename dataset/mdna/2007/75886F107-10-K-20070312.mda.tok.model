item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers  develops  and intends to commercialize pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical conditions 
we are currently focused on three development programs il trap rilonacept in various inflammatory indications  the vegf trap in oncology  and the vegf trap eye formulation in eye diseases using intraocular delivery 
the vegf trap is being developed in oncology in collaboration with the sanofi aventis group 
in october  we entered into collaboration with bayer healthcare llc for the development of the vegf trap eye 
our preclinical research programs are in the areas of oncology and angiogenesis  ophthalmology  metabolic and related diseases  muscle diseases and disorders  inflammation and immune diseases  bone and cartilage  pain  and cardiovascular diseases 
we expect that our next generation of product candidates will be based on our proprietary technologies for developing human monoclonal antibodies 
developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and expense 
since inception we have not generated any sales or profits from the commercialization of any of our product candidates and we may never receive such revenues 
before revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates can be realized  we or our collaborators must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing research and development and obtaining regulatory approval from the fda and regulatory authorities in other countries 
in addition  the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and new developments may render our products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete 
from inception on january  through december   we had a cumulative loss of million 
in the absence of revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates or other sources  the amount  timing  nature  and source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities 
we expect to incur substantial losses over the next several years as we continue the clinical development of the vegf trap eye and il trap  advance new product candidates into clinical development from our existing research programs utilizing our new technology for designing fully human monoclonal antibodies  continue our research and development programs  and commercialize product candidates that receive regulatory approval  if any 
also  our activities may expand over time and require additional resources  and we expect our operating losses to be substantial over at least the next several years 
our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend  among other factors  on the progress of our research and development efforts  the timing of certain expenses  and the amount and timing of payments that we receive from collaborators 
as a company that does not expect to be profitable over the next several years  management of cash flow is extremely important 
the most significant use of our cash is for research and development activities  which include drug discovery  preclinical studies  clinical trials  and the manufacture of drug supplies for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
in  our research and development expenses totaled million 
we expect these expenses to increase substantially in as we begin phase clinical trials of the vegf trap eye  expand our il trap clinical program  advance our antibody development program  and increase our research and development headcount 
the principal sources of cash to date have been sales of common equity and convertible debt and funding from our collaborators in the form of up front payments  research progress payments  and payments for our research and development activities 

table of contents a primary driver of our expenses is our number of full time employees 
our annual average headcount in was compared with in and in in  our average annual headcount decreased primarily as a result of reductions made in the fourth quarter of and mid year in these workforce reductions were associated with narrowing the focus of our research and development efforts  substantial improvements in manufacturing productivity  the june expiration of our collaboration with procter gamble  and the completion of contract manufacturing for merck in october in  we expect our annual average headcount to increase to approximately due  in part  to our expanded development programs for the vegf trap eye and il trap  and our plans to move two new antibody candidates into clinical trials every year beginning around the end of the planning  execution  and results of our clinical programs are significant factors that can affect our operating and financial results 
in our clinical programs  key events in and plans for are as follows product candidate events events plans vegf trap oncology initiated phase studies of the vegf trap as a single agent in aoc and nscla patients  and in aoc patients with sma

accounting for stock based employee compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  using the modified prospective method as described in sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
as a result  in  we recognized compensation expense  in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments including stock option awards on their date of grant  over the vesting period of the awards using graded vesting  which is an accelerated expense recognition method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation expense for regeneron is recognized for a all share based payments granted on or after january  and b all awards granted to employees prior to january  that were unvested on that date 
prior to the adoption of the fair value method  we accounted for stock based compensation to employees under the intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
therefore  compensation expense related to employee stock options was not reflected in operating expenses in any period prior to the first quarter of and prior period operating results have not been restated 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions  and requires the recognition of compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the share based payment including stock options and restricted stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited at the time of grant and to revise this estimate  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
effective january   and prior to our adoption of sfas r  we recognized the effect of forfeitures in stock based compensation cost in the period when they occurred  in accordance with sfas upon adoption of sfas r effective january   we were required to record a cumulative effect adjustment to reflect the effect of estimated forfeitures related to outstanding awards that are not expected to vest as of the sfas r adoption date 
this adjustment reduced our loss by million and is included in our operating results for the year ended december  as a cumulative effect adjustment of a change in accounting principle 
exclusive of the cumulative effect adjustment  the effect of the change from applying the provisions of sfas to applying the provisions of sfas r on our loss from operations  net loss  and net loss per share for the year ended december  was not significant  and there was no impact to our cash flows for the year ended december  non cash stock based employee compensation expense related to stock option awards stock option expense recognized in operating expenses totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  for the year ended december   million of stock option expense 
table of contents was capitalized into inventory 
as of december   there was million of stock based compensation cost related to outstanding nonvested stock options  net of estimated forfeitures  which had not yet been recognized in operating expenses 
we expect to recognize this compensation cost over a weighted average period of years 
in addition  there are  options which are unvested as of december  and would become vested upon our products achieving certain sales targets and the optionee satisfying certain service conditions 
potential compensation cost  measured on the grant date  related to these performance options totals million and will begin to be recognized only if  and when  these options performance condition is considered to be probable of attainment 
assumptions we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of each option granted under the regeneron pharmaceuticals  inc long term incentive plan 
using this model  fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to i expected volatility of our common stock price  ii the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise expected lives  iii expected dividend yield on our common stock  and iv risk free interest rates  which are based on quoted us treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options expected lives 
expected volatility has been estimated based on actual movements in our stock price over the most recent historical periods equivalent to the options expected lives 
expected lives are principally based on our limited historical exercise experience with option grants with similar exercise prices 
the expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future 
the following table summarizes the weighted average values of the assumptions we used in computing the fair value of option grants during  and expected volatility expected lives from grant date years years years expected dividend yield risk free interest rate changes in any of these estimates may materially affect the fair value of stock options granted and the amount of stock based compensation recognized in any period

new operating lease tarrytown  new york facilities in december  we entered into a new operating lease agreement for approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space at our current tarrytown location 
the new lease includes approximately  square feet that we currently occupy our retained facilities and approximately  square feet to be located in new facilities that will be constructed and which are expected to be completed in early the term of the lease is expected to commence in early and will expire approximately years later 
under the new lease we also have various options and rights on additional space at the tarrytown site  and will continue to lease our present facilities until the new facilities are ready for occupancy 
in addition  the lease contains three renewal options to extend the term of the lease by five years each and early termination options for our retained facilities only 
the lease provides for monthly payments over the term of the lease related to our retained facilities  the costs of construction and tenant improvements for our new facilities  and additional charges for utilities  taxes  and operating expenses 
in connection with the new lease agreement  in december  we issued a letter of credit in the amount of million to our landlord  which is collateralized by a million bank certificate of deposit 
capital expenditures our additions to property  plant  and equipment totaled million in  million in  and million in in  we expect to incur approximately million in capital expenditures primarily to support our manufacturing  development  and research activities 
funding requirements our total expenses for research and development from inception through december  have been approximately  million 
we have entered into various agreements related to our activities to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology platforms  including collaboration agreements  such as those with sanofi aventis and bayer  and agreements to use our velocigene technology platform 
we incurred expenses associated with these agreements  which include an allocable portion of general and administrative costs  of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur substantial funding requirements primarily for research and development activities including preclinical and clinical testing 
before taking into account reimbursements from collaborators  we currently anticipate that approximately of our expenditures for will be directed toward the preclinical and clinical development of product candidates  including the il trap  vegf trap  vegf trap eye  and monoclonal antibodies  approximately of our expenditures for will be applied to our basic research activities and the continued development of our novel technology platforms  and the remainder of our expenditures for will be used for capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 

table of contents in connection with our funding requirements  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  for leases and long term debt 
payments due by period less than to to greater than total one year years years years in millions convertible senior subordinated notes payable operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations includes amounts representing interest 
includes projected obligations based  in part  upon budgeted construction and tenant improvement costs related to our new operating lease for facilities to be constructed in tarrytown  new york  as described above 
excludes future contingent rental costs for utilities  real estate taxes  and operating expenses 
in  these costs were million 
in connection with certain clinical trial contracts with service providers  we may incur early termination penalties if the contracts are cancelled before agreed upon services are completed 
the amount we need to fund operations will depend on various factors  including the status of competitive products  the success of our research and development programs  the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities  the status of patents and other intellectual property rights  the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug candidates  and the continuation  extent  and success of our collaborations with sanofi aventis and bayer 
clinical trial costs are dependent  among other things  on the size and duration of trials  fees charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties  the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials  supplies  laboratory tests  and other expenses 
the amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and early stage clinical trials  regulatory requirements  the duration and results of clinical trials underway and of additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate  and the various factors that affect the cost of each trial as described above 
in the future  if we are able to successfully develop  market  and sell certain of our product candidates  we may be required to pay royalties or otherwise share the profits generated on such sales in connection with our collaboration and licensing agreements 
we expect that expenses related to the filing  prosecution  defense  and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims will continue to be substantial as a result of patent filings and prosecutions in the united states and foreign countries 
we believe that our existing capital resources will enable us to meet operating needs through at least early  without taking into consideration the million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes  which mature in october however  this is a forward looking statement based on our current operating plan  and there may be a change in projected revenues or expenses that would lead to our capital being consumed significantly before such time 
if there is insufficient capital to fund all of our planned operations and activities  we believe we would prioritize available capital to fund preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates 
other than the million letter of credit issued to our landlord in connection with our new operating lease for facilities in tarrytown  new york  as described above  we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
in addition  we do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity 
as of december   we had no established banking arrangements through which we could obtain short term financing or a line of credit 
in the event we need additional financing for the operation of our business  we will consider collaborative arrangements and additional public or private financing  including additional equity financing 
factors influencing the availability of additional financing include our progress in product development  investor perception of our prospects  and the general condition of the financial markets 
we may not be able to secure the necessary funding through new collaborative arrangements or additional public or private offerings 
if we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our 
table of contents capital requirements  we may have to delay  scale back  or eliminate certain of our research and development activities or future operations 
this could materially harm our business 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenue from contract research and development and research progress payments in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab and emerging issues task force  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
we earn contract research and development revenue and research progress payments in connection with collaboration and other agreements to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology platforms 
the terms of these agreements typically include non refundable up front licensing payments  research progress milestone payments  and payments for development activities 
non refundable up front license payments  where continuing involvement is required of us  are deferred and recognized over the related performance period 
we estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each agreement  and adjust the performance periods  if appropriate  based on the applicable facts and circumstances 
our performance period estimates are principally based on the results and progress of our research and development activities and revisions to these estimates could result in changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year in the future 
in addition  if a collaborator terminates the agreement in accordance with the terms of the contract  we would recognize the remainder of the up front payment at the time of the termination 
payments which are based on achieving a specific substantive performance milestone  involving a degree of risk  are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due and non refundable  provided there is no future service obligation associated with that milestone  a reasonable amount of time has passed between receipt of an up front payment and achievement of the milestone  and the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort  value  and risk associated with achieving the milestone 
payments for achieving milestones which are not considered substantive are accounted for as license payments and recognized over the related performance period 
payments for development activities are recognized as revenue as earned  over the period of effort 
in addition  we record revenue in connection with a government research grant as we incur expenses related to the grant  subject to the grant s terms and annual funding approvals 
recognition of deferred revenue related to contract manufacturing agreement we entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with merck  which expired in october  under which we manufactured a vaccine intermediate at our rensselaer  new york facility and performed services 
we recognized contract manufacturing revenue from this agreement after the product was tested and approved by  and shipped fob shipping point to  merck  and as services were performed 
in connection with the agreement  we agreed to modify portions of our rensselaer facility to manufacture merck s vaccine intermediate and merck agreed to reimburse us for the related capital costs 
these capital cost payments were deferred and recognized as revenue as product was shipped to merck  based upon our estimate of merck s order quantities each year through the expected end of the agreement which  for and prior years  was october in february  we agreed to extend the manufacturing agreement by one year through october since we commenced production of the vaccine intermediate in november  our estimates of merck s order quantities each year were not materially different from merck s actual orders 
clinical trial accrual estimates for each clinical trial that we conduct  certain clinical trial costs  which are included in research and development expenses  are expensed based on the expected total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which patients enter the trial  and the period over which clinical investigators or contract research organizations are expected to provide services 
we believe that this method best aligns the expenses we record with the efforts we expend on a clinical trial 
during the course of a trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
no material adjustments to our past clinical trial accrual estimates were made during the years ended december    and 
table of contents depreciation of property  plant  and equipment property  plant  and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets are charged to expense as incurred 
the cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts  and any gain or loss is recognized in operations 
the estimated useful lives of property  plant  and equipment are as follows building and improvements years laboratory and computer equipment years furniture and fixtures years leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
costs of construction of certain long lived assets include capitalized interest which is amortized over the estimated useful life of the related asset 
in some situations  the life of the asset may be extended or shortened if circumstances arise that would lead us to believe that the estimated life of the asset has changed 
the life of leasehold improvements may change based on the extension of lease contracts with our landlords 
changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods 
stock based employee compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under the provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  using the modified prospective method as described in sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
as a result  in  we recognized compensation expense  in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments including stock option awards on their date of grant  over the vesting period of the awards using graded vesting  which is an accelerated expense recognition method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation expense for regeneron is recognized for a all share based payments granted on or after january  and b all awards granted to employees prior to january  that were unvested on that date 
prior to the adoption of the fair value method  we accounted for stock based compensation to employees under the intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
therefore  compensation expense related to employee stock options was not reflected in operating expenses in any period prior to the first quarter of and prior period operating results have not been restated 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions  and requires the recognition of compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the share based payment including stock options and restricted stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited at the time of grant and to revise this estimate  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
effective january   and prior to our adoption of sfas r  we recognized the effect of forfeitures in stock based compensation cost in the period when they occurred  in accordance with sfas upon adoption of sfas r effective january   we were required to record a cumulative effect adjustment to reflect the effect of estimated forfeitures related to outstanding awards that are not expected to vest as of the sfas r adoption date 
this adjustment reduced our loss by million and is included in our operating results for the year ended december  as a cumulative effect adjustment of a change in accounting principle 
we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of each option granted under the regeneron pharmaceuticals  inc long term incentive plan 
using this model  fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to i expected volatility of our common stock price  ii the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise expected lives  iii expected dividend yield on our common stock  and iv risk free interest rates  which are based on quoted us treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options expected lives 
expected volatility has been estimated based on actual movements in our stock price over the most recent historical 
table of contents periods equivalent to the options expected lives 
expected lives are principally based on our limited historical exercise experience with option grants with similar exercise prices 
the expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future 
future impact of recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will be required to adopt fin effective for the fiscal year beginning january  our management believes that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we will be required to adopt sfas effective for the fiscal year beginning january  our management is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting sfas on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from our investment of available cash balances in investment grade corporate  asset backed  and us government securities 
we do not believe we are materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we estimated that a one percent change in interest rates would result in changes in the fair market value of our investment portfolio of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the impact of an interest rate change at december   compared to december   is due primarily to increases in our investment portfolio s balance and duration to maturity at the end of versus the end of
