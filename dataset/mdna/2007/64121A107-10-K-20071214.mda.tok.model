item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop and manufacture server appliance solutions that enable network equipment providers and independent software vendors  or isvs  to deliver their software applications in the form of a server appliance 
server appliances are pre configured network infrastructure devices designed to optimally deliver specific software application functionality and facilitate ease of deployment and support of a software application in a customer s network 
we offer server appliance customers a comprehensive suite of services  including development  manufacturing  fulfillment and post sale support in addition to certain software products  such as our news and ace linux products 
we produce and fulfill devices branded for our network equipment and isv customers  and derive our revenues from the sale of value added hardware platforms to these customers 
these customers subsequently sell and support the device under their own brands to their customer base 
during the quarter ended december   we changed the manner in which we view information regarding our results of operations for purposes of making decisions affecting the business 
these changes included consolidation of financial and operational information reviewed to evaluate our operations  discontinuing market demand creation for our ns series security appliances and using certain of those products as reference platforms for developing and selling appliances to system integrators and isvs  and the consolidation of our sales force 
therefore  we now have one reportable segment  which represents how we evaluate our operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made estimates and judgments in determining certain amounts included in the financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from products are generally recognized upon delivery to customers if persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
in the event we have unfulfilled future obligations  revenue and related costs are deferred until those future obligations are met 
we have an inventory consignment agreement with our largest customer related to certain server appliances 
this customer notifies us when it utilizes inventory and we recognize revenues from sales to this customer based upon these notifications 
maintenance revenues are derived from customer support agreements generally entered into in connection with the initial server appliance sales and subsequent renewals 
maintenance fees are typically for one to three year renewable periods and include the right to unspecified software updates when and if available for certain agreements  hardware repairs  hour customer support  and advanced replacement of server appliances 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
payments for maintenance fees are generally made in advance and are included in deferred revenue 
the associated maintenance expenses are expensed in the same period as incurred 
contracts and or customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and consignment usage notifications are used to verify shipment or transfer of ownership  as applicable 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
for revenue arrangements that contain multiple elements  such as the sale of both product and post sales support  in which software is not incidental to the product  we determine fair value based upon vendor specific objective evidence  which is typically established through contractual post sales support renewal rates whereby the residual fair value is allocated to the server appliance 
for revenue arrangements that contain multiple elements  in which software is not included or is incidental to the product  we determine fair value based on objective and reliable evidence of fair value  which is typically determined through contractual refund rates for cancellations  and stand alone sales of post sales support  whereby the residual fair value is allocated to the server appliance 
we recognize revenue when the revenue recognition criteria for each element of the sale is met 
if we are not able to derive the fair value of the undelivered element of the sale maintenance  all revenues from the arrangement are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the support arrangement  which is typically one to three years 
we include shipping and handling costs  if any  reimbursed by our customers as net revenues and cost of revenues 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or estimated market  and determine cost on a first in  first out basis 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a write down for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and anticipated production requirements in the near future 
any rapid technological changes and future product development could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
agreements with certain of our customers include inventory protection provisions  however  these provisions may not provide us with complete protection from loss due to excess or obsolete inventory 
product warranty obligations we offer a warranty on certain of our products that generally provides for us to repair or replace any defective products for a period of up to months after shipment 
we reserve for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue and record warranty expense as a component of cost of revenues 
costs included in our server appliance product warranty obligation include shipping  internal and external labor  and travel 
significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating our warranty reserve 
although our current server appliance products use more standards based technologies than in the past  certain of our server appliance products incorporate proprietary technologies  which may increase our risks related to product warranty obligations 
in the past we have experienced unexpected component failures in certain of our server appliance products  which have required us to increase our product warranty accruals 
at the time any unexpected component failure arises  we assess the costs to repair any defects and record what we believe to be an appropriate warranty obligation based on the information available 
to the extent we may experience increased warranty claim activity  increased costs associated with servicing those claims  or use estimates that prove to be materially different from actual claims  our product warranty obligations may need to be increased  resulting in decreased gross profits 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards r  share based payment  sfas r  on october  which requires us to measure compensation cost at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and to recognize that cost as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award 
prior to october   we accounted for stock based compensation to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and related interpretations 
we also followed the disclosure requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method as provided by sfas r and  accordingly  financial statement amounts for the prior periods presented in this form k have not been retroactively adjusted to reflect the fair value method of expensing stock based compensation 
under sfas r  we determine the fair value of stock options awarded based on the grant date fair value of the award using an option pricing model 
such an option pricing model requires us to make judgments for certain assumptions used  in particular  the expected term of the option and the expected volatility over that term 
we have determined the expected term using the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term for our options  also known as the simplified method described under staff accounting bulletin no 
 sab 
we have determined our expected volatility based on a weighted average of historical volatility 
in determining the amount of expense to be recorded  judgment is also required to estimate forfeitures of the awards based on the probability of employees completing the required service period 
historical forfeitures are used as a starting point for developing our estimate of future forfeitures 
income tax asset valuation we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimate of future taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
at september   we believe that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  and  accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit 
to the extent that net operating losses  when realized  relate to stock options deductions of approximately million  the resulting benefits will be credited to additional paid in capital 
results of operations the following data summarizes the results of our operations for the past three fiscal years  in thousands and as a percentage of net revenues 
fiscal year ended september  dollars of net revenues dollars of net revenues dollars of net revenues net revenues    gross profit a    operating expenses b and c   income loss from operations  net income loss    a includes approximately  and  related to stock based compensation in and  respectively 
b includes approximately million  million  and  related to stock based compensation in   and  respectively 
c includes approximately million related to an impairment charge for goodwill in discussion of fiscal and net revenues our revenues are derived from sales of server appliances primarily to our oem network equipment and isv customers 
our net revenues increased slightly for the year ended september  versus the same period in fiscal this was primarily due to higher sales volume partially offset by lower average selling prices 
net revenues from sales to emc represented and of net revenues in the year ended september  and  respectively 
in addition  net revenues from other customers for the year ended september  was million compared to million for the year ended september   after excluding net revenues from network intelligence corporation due to its acquisition by emc on september  this growth was attributable to the increase in revenue generated from new customers  an increase in revenue from existing customers  and revenue for servicing iag customers during fiscal gross profit gross profit represents net revenues recognized less the cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes cost of materials  warranty costs  inventory obsolescence charges  shipping and handling costs  customer support costs  and manufacturing costs  which are primarily comprised of compensation  contract labor costs and  when applicable  contract manufacturing costs 
gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased for the year ended september   compared to the year ended september  the increase from the prior year was primarily due to increased service revenues which carry higher gross margins  the timing of cost reductions relative to price reductions to customers in relation to consistent per unit gross margin dollars 
these increases were partially offset by higher warranty expenses and lower appliance average selling prices 
our gross profit is affected by product mix and product pricing as well as the timing  size and configuration of server appliance orders 
gross profit is also affected by the mix of product manufactured internally compared to product manufactured by our contract manufacturer  which carries higher manufacturing costs 
we expect gross profit to continue to be affected by these factors 
operating expenses the most significant components of our operating expenses are research and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
the following table presents operating expenses during the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended september  increase decrease dollars of net revenues dollars of net revenues dollars percentage operating expenses research and development   selling and marketing    general and administrative   total operating expenses    research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in research and development  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  costs for prototype and test units and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancements of our server appliance products 
we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred

the increase of compensation and related expenses is primarily related to salary cost of living adjustments occurring during the year as well as the timing of new hires 
the increase in consulting costs as well as the decrease in prototype costs relates to the timing of certain development projects 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for personnel engaged in sales and marketing  costs associated with our marketing programs  which include costs associated with our attendance at trade shows  public relations  product literature costs  web site enhancements and product evaluation costs  consulting and outside services costs and travel

this decrease is the result of our strategic change to decrease demand creation sales and marketing activities and more fully leverage our customers sales and marketing resources 
in particular resulting from this strategic change  we decreased headcount from at september  to at september  thereby causing the compensation and related expenses to decrease as well as the stock based compensation expense to decrease 
in addition  the reduction in marketing expenses and travel is a result of reduced spending on end user lead generation programs for our ns series security appliances 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for executive  finance  information technology and human resources personnel  professional services  which include legal  accounting  audit and tax fees  and costs of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  and director and officer insurance

the increase in professional services is due primarily to costs associated with the investigation of embezzlement by a former non management employee which was detected during the fourth quarter of fiscal and was completed during the first quarter of fiscal interest and other income  net interest and other income  net increased to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  this increase is primarily due to higher interest rates and higher balances of our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
discussion of fiscal and net revenues net revenues from sales to emc represented and of net revenues in the year ended september  and  respectively net revenues increased from to primarily due to an increase in sales volumes to emc partially offset by lower average selling prices as well as a decrease in our sales of third party data storage networking products  which we no longer sold subsequent to december  additionally  net revenues to customers  other than emc  increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross profit gross profit increased for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of increased sales volumes partially offset by lower average selling prices 
fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net revenues declined slightly due to lower average selling prices 
in addition  we incurred additional costs related to marketing incentives and programs that are required to be recorded as reductions of revenue  and the overhead of our customer support investments

these were partially offset by decreases in marketing programs and other expenses 
the increase in compensation and related expenses was due to our expansion of our european sales force  which we began to form in fiscal the reduction in our marketing programs was primarily related to reduced spending on end user lead generation programs for certain products in the second half of fiscal the decrease in other expenses primarily related to decreases in our recruiting expenses attributable to the timing of newly hired employees and lower depreciation expense

this decrease was partially offset by the addition of stock based compensation 
the decrease in professional services was due primarily to a decrease in costs associated with the sarbanes oxley compliance since fiscal was our second year of implementation and a decrease in legal costs associated with the timing of certain litigation activities 
impairment of goodwill based on the fact that we exited the portion of the tidalwire business during the first quarter of  we determined that our goodwill was impaired resulting in an impairment charge of  for the year ended september  interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher average interest rates earned on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes cash flow activities for the fiscal years ended in thousands september  net income loss   non cash adjustments to net income loss   changes in working capital   cash provided by used in operating activities cash provided by investing activities   cash provided by financing activities   increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year   cash and cash equivalents at end of year the following table presents our short term investments as of the years ended in thousands september  short term investments  operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities of million for fiscal were attributable to a net income of million and changes in working capital of million as well as an increase by non cash adjustments to net income of million 
non cash adjustments to net income consisted substantially of stock based compensation of million and depreciation expense of  significant cash flow effects from changes in working capital for fiscal included a decrease in cash flows from our million increase in inventory offset by increased cash flows from an increase in our accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and a million increase in our deferred revenue 
the increases in our accounts payable and accrued expenses are primarily a result of increased sales volumes  in the quarter ended september   which also necessitated increased purchasing volume 
the increase in deferred revenue is primarily related to the transfer of the support obligations of the previously installed whale appliances from microsoft 
investing activities cash flows provided by investing activities during fiscal resulted from net sales of million of short term available for sale investments partially offset by  of investments made in property and equipment 
due to the acquisition of alliance systems on october   the company sold approximately million of short term available for sale investments 
this amount was partially offset by  of investments in property and equipment 
financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities consisted of cash received as a result of employee stock option and stock purchase plan activity of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal we expect employee stock option activity to continue in fiscal  however  we cannot predict its level given the volatility of our stock price 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make certain payments in thousands 
payments due by period less than year years years after years total operating leases  capital lease obligation total  our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the timing and size of orders from our largest customer  our ability to enter into partnerships with network equipment providers and independent software vendors  the level of success of our customers in selling server appliance solutions that include our server appliance hardware platforms  the costs and timing of product engineering efforts and the success of these efforts  and market developments 
we believe that our available cash resources  including cash and cash equivalents  and cash that we expect to generate from sales of our products will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
on october   we completed our acquisition of alliance systems  inc  a leading provider of server appliances and computer infrastructure supporting telecommunications and enterprise communications 
this acquisition  which was valued at approximately million  was funded through a combination of approximately million in cash and the issuance of million shares of our common stock 
in connection with this acquisition  we entered into a loan and security agreement the loan agreement with silicon valley bank 
the loan agreement provides us with a revolving line of credit in an amount up to the lesser of a  or b  plus of our eligible accounts receivable  as defined in the loan agreement 
the line of credit matures and the principal balance outstanding is payable in full on october  as of december   we have not drawn on this line of credit 
in the event that our available cash resources and silicon valley bank line of credit are not sufficient  after the line of credit matures on october   we would need to raise additional funds 
we may in the future seek to raise additional funds through borrowings  public or private equity financings or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or  if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
additional equity financings could result in dilution to our shareholders 
if additional financing is needed and is not available on acceptable terms  we may need to reduce our operating expenses and scale back our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements sab 
sab addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab requires us to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors

fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in companies financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  and provides guidance on financial statement recognition and disclosure for tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin is a two step process 
the first step is recognition whereby companies must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination 
the second step is measurement whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of recognized tax benefits  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition
