onshore gulf coast province our onshore gulf coast province is a high potential  multi pay province that lends itself to d seismic exploration due to its substantial structural and stratigraphic complexity 
in addition  certain sand reservoirs display seismic bright spots  which can be direct hydrocarbon indicators and can result in greatly reduced drilling risk 
however  bright spots are not always reliable as direct hydrocarbon indicators and do not generally assess reservoir productivity 
we believe our established d seismic exploration approach  combined with our exploration staff s extensive experience and accumulated knowledge base in this province  provides us with significant competitive advantages 
key operating trends within this province include the vicksburg trend in brooks county  texas and the frio trend in and around matagorda county  texas 
in addition  during the first quarter we announced joint ventures with two operators to explore for oil and natural gas in southern louisiana 
we view southern louisiana as a logical extension of our current activities in the onshore texas gulf coast 
as such  southern louisiana operations have been consolidated within our onshore gulf coast province 
over the three year period ended december   approximately of our total capital expenditures for drilling  land and seismic were allocated to our onshore gulf coast province  where we completed gross wells net in attempts for a completion rate of 
during  we completed gross wells net in attempts for a completion rate of in this province 
five of the completed wells were exploration wells and seven were development wells 
we also had one exploration well and one development well that were completing and one development well that was drilling as of december  we operated of the wells that we drilled in this province during for  we spent million on drilling  land and seismic in our onshore gulf coast province 
approximately of the drilling  land and seismic was allocated to the vicksburg  to the frio  to southern louisiana  and to other areas in the province 

table of contents for  we currently plan to spend a total of million in our onshore gulf coast province 
approximately million of this spending has been allocated to drilling  with the remaining million allocated to capital spending for land and seismic activities 
we plan to drill seven development wells and spend approximately million on development drilling capital 
we also plan to drill two exploration wells and spend million on exploration drilling capital 
vicksburg trend our vicksburg activity is focused principally in brooks county  texas  in our home run  triple crown  and floyd fields 
we discovered these fields in  and  respectively 
in  we successfully completed all five of our development drilling wells spud in including three in the triple crown field  one in the home run field and one in the floyd field 
total drilling  land and seismic capital expended in the vicksburg during was million 
during  we operated all of our vicksburg drilling  and the working interests we retained in our vicksburg wells was higher than our historic average as our joint venture participant elected to take a more passive role in the development of the field 
rather than participating in the drilling of the wells with a paying working interest  our joint venture participant elected to receive a reversionary  or back in working interest  based on certain payout thresholds in all of the vicksburg wells 
we continue to have discussions with our joint venture participant about other exploratory joint venture opportunities in the area and expect to continue to expand our activities in the trend 
early in  we successfully completed the triple crown field sullivan c and home run field palmer s  which were carryover wells from the drilling program  at approximately mmcfe per day and mmcfe per day  respectively 
thereafter  we completed the home run field palmer and triple crown field dawson  which produced at initial rates of approximately mmcfe per day and mmcfe per day  respectively 
in august  we completed the triple crown field dawson well from the sands at an initial rate of approximately mmcfe per day 
in september  we successfully completed the triple crown field sullivan f  which came on line at approximately mmcfe per day 
we encountered four pay zones and are currently producing only out of the deepest zone  the dawson sand 
our plans are to commingle the remaining three zones after flowing tubing pressures from the dawson sand subside 
the remaining feet of apparent pay includes  from shallowest to deepest  the brigham  and loma blanca sands 
production from the dawson sand indicates the potential for further reserve growth in the vicksburg  as this is the first well to be completed to sales from this zone 
also in september  we commenced drilling the floyd field sullivan c  an offset to our highly productive sullivan the sullivan c was brought on line in january at a rate of approximately mmcf of natural gas and barrels of oil per day mmcfe per day 
subsequently  other pay intervals were brought on line and production increased to mmcfe per day 
during  we plan to operate a drilling rig on a continuous basis in the vicksburg 
in mid january  we spud the dawson s  the first of five consecutive vicksburg wells we expect to drill in the dawson s is a sidetrack of the previously drilled dawson and is an east offset to the aforementioned sullivan f based on mud logs and wireline logs  the dawson s appears to have encountered roughly comparable and loma blanca pay to that found in the offsetting wells 
we retained a working and net revenue interest in the dawson s 
following the dawson s  we plan to drill the sullivan c in our triple crown field 
this well will test a number of upper vicksburg pay intervals  and has the potential to prove up significant and additional locations and reserves 
we expect the sullivan c to be followed by the sullivan  which is also a well that could prove up additional development locations in our triple crown field 
following the sullivan  brigham plans to commence the sullivan  a significant development well in our home run field 
the sullivan appears to be located in a structurally high location at various lower vicksburg intervals  and could potentially prove up significant additional locations and reserves 
we expect to retain a working interest in the sullivan subject to a back in at payout 
during  we plan to spend million to drill five development wells  to drill and complete wells that were in progress at december  and for other development activities 
we expect to retain an average initial working interest of in these wells 
we also expect to spend million on land and seismic 
since  we have drilled vicksburg wells  and we have completed of those tests 
we believe we have a multi year inventory of drilling locations in our home run  triple crown and floyd fault block fields  and we expect to add to this inventory in frio trend during  we drilled seven wells that targeted the frio  including four exploratory and three development wells 
drilling  land and seismic capital expenditures for totaled million 

table of contents the sartwelle was completed in the middle frio and encountered feet of apparent pay in a fault block that is estimated to be acres 
production commenced in april at approximately mmcfe per day 
the trull b encountered feet of apparent pay in various frio intervals and was brought on line in june at mmcfe per day 
our state tract tested what has been mapped as a acre complex in the lower frio and encountered feet of apparent lower frio pay  with an additional feet of potential pay that will likely be tested at a later date 
this exploratory well initially flowed at approximately mmcfe per day  but experienced a decline in production and began producing some sand 
as a consequence  a frac pac was put in place to enhance production and to limit sand production 
subsequent to the frac pac  the well produced approximately mcfe per day  with additional potential pay remaining behind pipe for future completion 
in december  we commenced drilling our high potential frio exploratory test  the green ranch in january  after encountering poor sand quality  the well was plugged and abandoned 
in  we currently plan to spend million to drill one exploration well  to drill and complete wells that were in progress at december  and for other development activities 
southern louisiana trend in february  we announced two new joint ventures to explore and develop d delineated projects that target the miocene and upper oligocene trends located in south louisiana 
we view these projects as a logical extension of our activities in the onshore texas gulf coast 
in southern louisiana  we will utilize our geophysical  geological and operational expertise to explore for and develop potential oligocene and miocene reservoirs directly on trend to that of the texas gulf coast frio 
during  we drilled eight wells in the area with drilling  land and seismic expenditures totaling million 
in our bayou postillion project  which is located in iberia parish  louisiana  we operated the drilling of the cotten land corp 
 with a after casing point working interest 
the cotten land corp 
encountered feet of apparent pay in a miocene objective approximately feet high to a down dip producer 
the well put on line in september at an initial rate of approximately mmcfe per day and in march was producing at a rate of approximately mmcfe per day 
in august  we participated in drilling an offset to the cotten land  the marie snyder  which found feet of apparent pay 
we retain a working interest in the well  which is in the process of being completed 
on december   we spud our cotton land  which is our second development well in bayou postillion 
we successfully production tested the cotten land  which encountered approximately feet of apparent net pay in two intervals 
the cotten land was tested from the lowest feet of pay at a production rate of mmcf of natural gas and barrels of oil per day with strong pressures 
based on the minimal pressure differences between the flowing and shut in tubing pressures  we expect to produce the well at an initial rate between mmcfe and mmcfe per day 
approximately feet of shallower pay will remain behind pipe for future completion 
brigham operates the cotten land with an approximate working interest 
during the second quarter  we plan to commence the cotten land  which is expected to test an apparent new fault block adjacent to the fault block in which brigham drilled the cotten land well 
the unrisked reserve potential of this apparent fault block is estimated at approximately to bcfe 
following the cotten land  brigham plans to commence the cotten land  offsetting brigham s previously drilled cotten land discovery 
in our mystic bayou project located in st 
martin parish  louisiana  we identified at least three apparent fault blocks to test  all three of which we expect to encounter a miocene objective structurally high to two wells that have combined to produce over bcfe to date 
in november  we commenced drilling of the williams land company on the first of the three prospective fault blocks 
in december  the well was plugged and abandoned after encountering tight and wet pay 
the remaining two apparent fault blocks remain in inventory  one of which may be drilled in depending on the post drill analysis of the williams land company dry hole 
in addition  a number of shallow and deeper prospects and leads have been identified in the mystic bayou project 
in  we plan to spend a total of million to drill two development wells  one exploration well  to complete wells in progress and for other development activities 
we also expected to spend million in land and seismic 
anadarko basin province the anadarko basin is located in the texas panhandle and western oklahoma 
we believe this prolific natural gas producing province offers a combination of relatively lower risk exploration and development opportunities in shallower horizons  as well as higher risk  but higher reserve potential opportunities in the deeper sections that have been relatively under explored 

table of contents we believe our drilling program in the anadarko basin generally provides us with longer life reserves and helps to balance our drilling program in our prolific  but generally shorter reserve life  onshore gulf coast province 
the stratigraphic and structural objectives in the anadarko basin can provide excellent targets for d seismic imaging 
in addition  drilling economics in the anadarko basin are enhanced by the multi pay nature of many of the prospects  with secondary or tertiary targets serving as either incremental value or as alternatives if the primary target zone is not productive 
our recent activity has been focused primarily in the hunton trend  springer channel and springer bar trends and the granite wash trend 
during  we drilled ten development and three exploration wells 
of the million that we spent on this province in  approximately was allocated to the hunton trend  was allocated to the granite wash trend  was allocated to the springer trends and to other anadarko basin projects 
of our capital spent in the hunton in  million was spent in to acquire square miles of high resolution d seismic data and land over a portion of wheeler county  texas  which includes our mills ranch field as well as ten hunton exploration prospects 
during  we expect to spend million to drill four exploration wells  complete wells that were in progress and on other activities 
we also expect to spend million on net land and seismic 
hunton trend in january  we commenced operations on a re entry and sidetrack of the previously drilled mills ranch s 
the mills ranch s reentered and sidetracked out of the mills ranch s borehole at a depth of approximately  feet 
we subsequently directionally drilled to a depth of approximately  feet to test the hunton in what we determined to be in an adjacent fault block and encountered feet of apparent pay 
the well came on line at approximately mmcfe per day and in january was producing at a rate of approximately mmcfe per day 
in march  we commenced the drilling of the mills ranch  a development well on the westernmost end of the mills ranch field 
the well was drilled to a depth of approximately  feet and offsets our mills ranch well  which since december has produced approximately bcfe and is expected to ultimately produce approximately bcfe 
completion of the well was delayed due to operational complexities  primarily related to a mixed stream of water and gas from two different producing zones 
the water bearing zone was isolated and production was tested from the viola  the deepest producing interval in the well  which came on line at mmcfe per day and then decreased to mmcfe per day 
we are preparing to perforate and stimulate the upper chimney hill  haragan and henryhouse hunton intervals  which appear to be comparable pay intervals to the mills ranch well discussed above 
after production is established in the hunton pay intervals  we expect to commingle these intervals with the viola producing interval 
we operate the mills ranch with an appropriate working interest 
in june  a tubing leak developed in our mills ranch well 
in july  we commenced operations to pull the tubing and remediate the well  but had difficulties in fishing the tubing out of the well 
subsequent to fishing the tubing  we discovered the casing was parted 
after further remediation was unsuccessful  it was determined that the best course of action was to sidetrack the well at a later date 
as a result  a kick off plug was set 
prior to developing the tubing leak  the well was producing approximately mmcfe per day 
granite wash trend in february  we commenced the hobart  which upon completion came on line at approximately mmcfe per day 
although no additional wells in our  acre contiguous held by production acreage block were drilled in or are scheduled for  with strong commodity prices  we could accelerate our granite wash drilling program in assuming acre spacing  approximately additional locations could be drilled to fully develop our acreage 
rocky mountains province powder river basin in february  we signed a letter of intent to acquire a working interest in an unconventional shale play in the powder river basin of wyoming 
vertical wells in the area  which date as far back as  targeted shales approximately feet thick at a depth of about  feet 
approximately of these wells were completed in the targeted shale and produced between to barrels of oil per day 
given the historical results  we believe the application of horizontal drilling technology and or advanced fracture stimulation could significantly increase the productivity of the shale zone 
to earn a working interest in approximately  net acres that our joint venture partners had accumulated in the play  we carried the drilling and completion costs of the first two wells for our partners and also paid the first million of incremental land acquisition costs 
the vast majority of our obligations to carry our partners for drilling  completion and land acquisition costs were fulfilled in as of december   we hold a total of over approximately  gross and  net acres in the play  located primarily in niobrara county  wyoming 

table of contents our first well in the play  the krejci federal h  was spud at the end of july we are currently conducting varied and extensive production tests to evaluate the effectiveness of different completion methodologies 
initially  we tested only the last feet of the approximate  foot lateral  which was not cased 
subsequent to fracture stimulation and hook up to a rod pump  the krejci was producing between and barrels of oil per day from the outer feet of the lateral 
in late december  we began operations to test the innermost  foot cased portion of the well 
we perforated and fractured stimulated three different intervals in this portion of the well bore and the well produce significant volumes of load water and between and barrels of oil per day 
we drilled out the temporary plug to commingle production and installed a submersible pump 
pump problems  however  have prevented us from obtaining a stabilized rate 
we expect to reinstall a submersible pump or install a more conventional rod pump 
we are currently in the process of completing our second well in the area  the mills trust the well was drilled to a vertical depth of approximately  feet and then a  foot lateral was drilled 
casing was set on the first feet of the lateral 
the outermost feet of the lateral was left uncased 
we fracture stimulated the outer feet of the lateral and installed pumping equipment 
after stimulation  the well produced approximately barrels of load water and barrels of oil  with to barrels of load water remaining to be recovered 
subsequent to testing the open hole section  brigham will production test the remaining feet of the lateral which is currently behind production casing 
subsequent to completion testing in this part of the well bore  we will test the innermost feet of the well bore 
in  we spent million in the powder river basin to complete the two aforementioned horizontal wells  to drill two other unsuccessful shallow vertical exploration wells targeting other primary objectives and to acquire land and seismic data 
beginning in march  we currently plan on committing a rig full time to the development of our mowry acreage 
in  we anticipate spending approximately million to drill eight wells  to acquire additional acreage and conduct additional seismic delineation testing 
williston basin on november   we spent approximately million to acquire a working interest in approximately  net acres in mckenzie and williams counties in north dakota 
since then  we have acquired significant additional acreage  and as of december  we had approximately  gross and net acres under lease 
of this acreage  approximately  net acres are in north dakota  with approximately  net acres in roosevelt and sheridan counties  montana 
the bakken is an unconventional oil play at a depth of approximately  feet 
within a square mile area of richland county  montana  approximately bakken wells have generated average initial production rates of approximately barrels of oil per day  average cumulative production to date of approximately  barrels of oil per well  and estimated ultimate recoveries of approximately  barrels of oil per well based on data compiled from external sources 
our current drilling activities are approximately miles east of the ongoing bakken activity in richland county  montana 
our original three well program consisted of wells approximately  feet deep with single long laterals of approximately  feet 
in  we spent million on drilling  land and seismic 
approximately million was allocated to the drilling of three pilot wells in north dakota 
the first well  the field h  was spud in may and subsequent to stimulation and installation of a rod pump  came on line at approximately barrels of oil per day 
by december  the well appeared to have stabilized at between and barrels of oil per day 
our second well  the mracheck h  was hooked up to a rod pump prior to stimulation and recently was producing approximately barrels of oil per day 
a fracture stimulation of the well is planned for this spring 
the third well  the erickson h  was fracture stimulated and initially produced at approximately barrels of oil per day  but quickly declined to a rate of approximately barrels of oil per day 
frac sand was apparently inhibiting production 
in january we commenced operations to clean out the lateral and hook the well up to a rod pump for further production testing 
after cleaning out the lateral  the well produced up to barrels of oil per day and then declined to barrels per day 
in  we anticipate spending approximately million to complete wells in progress and acquire land and seismic 
we are currently evaluating the feasibility of drilling a tri lateral well on our north dakota acreage  but will monitor activity by other operators in the areas either currently drilling or planning to drill tri laterals 
depending on the drilling success that other operators have in the vicinity of our north dakota acreage  we may commence a tri lateral  dual lateral or single lateral well during the second half of in addition  we may form an area of mutual interest around a portion of our substantial montana acreage position and bring in a joint venture participant to potentially recoup a portion of our costs  fund a seismic shoot  and fund a portion of our drilling and completion costs  in order to accelerate activity over some of our acreage 

table of contents west texas and other province the permian basin of west texas and eastern new mexico is a predominantly oil producing province with generally longer life reserves than that of our onshore gulf coast 
our drilling activity in our west texas province has been focused primarily in various carbonate reservoirs  including the canyon reef and fusselman formations of the horseshoe atoll trend  the canyon reef of the eastern shelf  the wolfcamp and devonian section of new mexico  and the mississippian reef of the hardeman basin  at depths ranging from  to  feet 
over the past three years  approximately of our total capital expenditures for drilling  land and seismic have been allocated to our west texas province where we have completed five gross wells net in eight attempts for a completion rate of 
during  we completed two gross wells net in three attempts for a completion rate of 
all three of these wells were exploration wells  with two of the three operated by a private operator 
the pink floyd and pink champagne wells in the canyon reef play came on line at approximately and bopd  respectively 
for  we currently plan to spend approximately million on drilling  land and seismic 
d seismic exploration we have accumulated d seismic data covering approximately  square miles million acres in ten states 
we typically acquire d seismic data in and around existing producing fields where we can benefit from the imaging of producing analog wells 
these d defined analogs  combined with our experience in drilling wells  the majority of which were imaged utilizing our d seismic data and interpretation  provide us with a knowledge base to evaluate other potential geologic trends  d seismic projects within these trends and prospective d delineated drilling locations 
through our experience in the early and mid s  we developed an expertise in the selection of geologic trends that we believe are best suited for d seismic exploration 
we have used the experience that we have gained within our core trends to enhance the quality of subsequent projects in the same trend and other analogous trends to help lower finding and development costs  compress project cycle times and enhance our return on capital 
over the last years  we have accumulated substantial experience exploring with d seismic in a wide range of reservoir types and geologic trapping mechanisms 
in addition  we typically acquire digital databases for integration on our computer aided exploration workstations  including digital land grids  well information  log curves  production information  geologic studies  geologic top databases and existing d seismic data 
we use our knowledge base  local geological expertise and digital databases integrated with d seismic data to create maps of producing and potentially productive reservoirs 
as such  we believe our d generated maps are more accurate than previous reservoir maps which generally are based on subsurface geological information and d seismic surveys  enabling us to more precisely evaluate recoverable reserves and the economic feasibility of projects and drilling locations 
historically  we have acquired most of our raw d seismic data using seismic acquisition vendors on either a proprietary basis or through alliances affording the alliance members the exclusive right to interpret and use data for extended periods of time 
in addition  we have participated in non proprietary group shoots of d seismic data commonly referred to as spec data when we believe the expected full cycle project economics could not justify the acquisition of proprietary data 
further  we have exchanged certain interests in some of our non core proprietary seismic data to gain access to additional d seismic data 
in most of our proprietary d data acquisitions and alliances  we have selected the sites of projects  primarily guided by our knowledge and experience in the core provinces we explore  established and monitored the seismic parameters of each project for which seismic data was acquired  and typically selected the equipment that was used 
combining our geologic and geophysical expertise with a sophisticated land effort  we manage the majority of our projects from conception through d acquisition  processing and interpretation and leasing 
in addition  we manage the negotiation and drafting of virtually all of our geophysical exploration agreements  resulting in reduced contract risk and more consistent deal terms 
because we generate most of our projects  we can often control the size of the working interest that we retain as well as the selection of the operator and the non operating participants 

table of contents during  we added approximately square miles of d seismic data to our corporate database 
of this total  we acquired approximately square miles of non proprietary and square miles of new proprietary d seismic data in our alamo project located in the frio trend of the upper texas gulf coast 
we sold a working interest in alamo to an industry participant on a promoted basis and retained a working interest in the project 
also included in the d seismic data that we added to our corporate database in were approximately square miles of new proprietary data we acquired in our general lee project  which is located in the frio trend of the upper texas gulf coast 
we sold a working interest in general lee to an industry participant on a promoted basis and retained a working interest 
during  we added approximately square miles of d seismic data to our corporate database 
all square miles of d seismic data acquired were non proprietary to us 
included in the d seismic data that we added to our corporate database in was approximately square miles of data in our mudflats project located in the frio trend along the lower texas gulf coast 
we retained a working interest in our mudflats project 
during  we added approximately square miles of d seismic data to our corporate database 
approximately square miles of d seismic data was acquired on a proprietary basis and the remaining square miles was acquired on a non proprietary basis 
included in the d seismic data that we added to our corporate database in was approximately square miles of data from our proprietary laker project  which is in the hunton trend of our anadarko basin 
we retained a working interest in our laker project

title to properties we believe we have satisfactory title  in all material respects  to substantially all of our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry 
our properties are subject to royalty interests  standard liens incident to operating agreements  liens for current taxes and other burdens  which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect the value of such properties 
substantially all of our proved oil and natural gas properties are pledged as collateral under first and second liens for borrowings under our senior credit agreement

b these base prices were adjusted to reflect applicable transportation and quality differentials on a well by well basis to arrive at realized sales prices used to estimate our reserves at these dates 

table of contents the reserve estimates reflected above were prepared by cawley  gillespie associates  inc  our independent petroleum consultants  and are part of reports on our oil and natural gas properties prepared by them 
in accordance with applicable requirements of the securities and exchange commission sec  estimates of our net proved reserves and future net revenues are made using sales prices estimated to be in effect as of the date of such reserve estimates and are held constant throughout the life of the properties except to the extent a contract specifically provides for escalation 
estimated quantities of net proved reserves and future net revenues there from are affected by oil and natural gas prices  which have fluctuated widely in recent years 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their estimated values  including many factors beyond our control 
the reserve data set forth in the cawley  gillespie associates  inc report represents only estimates 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geologic interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates of different engineers  including those used by us  may vary 
in addition  estimates of reserves are subject to revision based upon actual production  results of future development and exploration activities  prevailing oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and other factors 
the revisions may be material 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered and are highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they are based 
our estimated net proved reserves  included in our security and exchange commission filings  have not been filed with or included in reports to any other federal agency 
see item a 
risk factors although our oil and gas reserve data is independently estimated  these estimates may still prove to be inaccurate 
estimates with respect to net proved reserves that may be developed and produced in the future are often based upon volumetric calculations and upon analogy to similar types of reserves rather than actual production history 
estimates based on these methods are generally less reliable than those based on actual production history 
subsequent evaluation of the same reserves based upon production history will result in variations in the estimated reserves that may be substantial 
reconciliation of standardized measure to pre tax pv pre tax pv is the estimated present value of the future net revenues from our proved oil and natural gas reserves before income taxes discounted using a discount rate 
pre tax pv is considered a non gaap financial measure under sec regulations because it does not include the effects of future income taxes  as is required in computing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
we believe that pre tax pv is an important measure that can be used to evaluate the relative significance of our oil and natural gas properties and that pre tax pv is widely used by security analysts and investors when evaluating oil and natural gas companies 
because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes to be paid  the use of a pre tax measure provides greater comparability of assets when evaluating companies 
we believe that most other companies in the oil and natural gas industry calculate pre tax pv on the same basis 
pre tax pv is computed on the same basis as the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows but without deducting income taxes 
the table below provides a reconciliation of our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows to our pre tax pv value 
at december  standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows add present value of future income tax discounted at fas assumption differences pre tax pv
