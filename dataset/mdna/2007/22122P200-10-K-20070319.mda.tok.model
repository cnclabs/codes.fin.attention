item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended january   january  and january  should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this annual report 
our discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under cautionary note regarding forward looking statements below and elsewhere in this annual report 
business overview systemwide restaurants fiscal year company company company owned franchise total owned franchise total owned franchise total restaurants at beginning of period a new restaurants opened restaurants permanently closed restaurants at end of period a a includes two company owned locations that were closed in october of as result of hurricane wilma 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  one location was re opened and one location was permanently closed 
we currently operate company owned premium convenience restaurants in states and the district of columbia  including one restaurant opened subsequent to fiscal our restaurants offer innovative savory 
table of contents made to order products featuring our authentic hearth baked crackly crust signature cosi bread and fresh distinctive ingredients 
we maintain a pipeline of new menu offerings that are introduced seasonally through limited time offerings to keep our products relevant to our target customers 
our menu features high quality sandwiches  freshly tossed salads  cosi bagels  hot melts  pizzas  s mores and other desserts  and a variety of coffees along with other soft drink beverages  teas  and alcoholic beverages 
our restaurants offer lunch and afternoon coffee in a counter service format  with most offering breakfast and or dinner and dessert menus as well 
we operate our company owned restaurants in two formats cosi and cosi downtown 
cosi downtown restaurants  which are located in nonresidential central business districts  close for the day in the early evening  while cosi restaurants offer dinner and dessert in a casual dining atmosphere 
we are currently eligible to offer franchises in states and the district of columbia 
we offer franchises to area developers and individual franchise operators 
the initial franchise fee  payable to us  for both an area developer and an individual franchise operator  is  for the first restaurant and  for each additional restaurant 
we believe that offering cosi franchised restaurants to area developers and individual franchisees offers the prospects of strong financial returns 
by franchising  we believe we will be able to increase the presence of our restaurants in various markets throughout the country and generate additional revenue without the large upfront capital commitments and risk associated with opening company owned restaurants 
as of january   we had secured franchise commitments from area developers for restaurants  including restaurants existing as of the end of fiscal  and one international license agreement 
we are currently licensing the right to develop and operate cosi franchised restaurants in certain foreign jurisdictions in compliance with applicable local rules and regulations in these certain foreign jurisdictions 
we have secured a franchise commitment from an area developer in the persian gulf 
we expect that company owned restaurants restaurants that we own as opposed to franchised restaurants will always be an important part of our new restaurant growth  and we believe that incorporating a franchising and area developer model into our strategy will position us to maximize the market potential for the cosi brand and concept consistent with our available capital 
during fiscal  we opened twenty one new company owned restaurants and re opened one location operated under our foodservice partnership with federated department stores  inc macy s which closed in fiscal due to hurricane wilma  and permanently closed a second macy s location that had also closed in fiscal due to hurricane wilma 
also in fiscal we sold two company owned restaurants  one each to a new jersey and a connecticut based franchise area developer 
during fiscal  we concluded our pilot program with federated department stores  inc which was launched in march after evaluating the pilot program  cosi and macy s agreed that  while cosi fulfilled macy s goals for a distinctive rest and refresh service offering for its guests  our respective capital priorities prevented any further expansion of the program 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we closed four of the locations operated in macy s stores around the country 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable and generally accepted for companies in the restaurant industry 
we believe that the following addresses the more critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents long lived assets statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires management judgments regarding the future operating and disposition plans for marginally performing assets  and estimates of expected realizable values for assets to be sold 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the application of sfas has affected the amount and timing of charges to operating results that have been significant in recent years 
we evaluate possible impairment at the individual restaurant level whenever we determine impairment factors are present 
we have developed and implemented an operational improvement plan and we undertake impairment reviews periodically 
we consider a history of poor financial operating performance to be the primary indicator of potential impairment for individual restaurant locations 
we determine whether a restaurant location is impaired based on expected undiscounted cash flows  generally for the remainder of the lease term  and then determine the impairment charge based on discounted cash flows for the same period 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to one underperforming macy s location 
lease termination charges statement for financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred  rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
for all exit activities  we estimate our likely liability under contractual leases for restaurants that have been closed 
such estimates have affected the amount and timing of charges to operating results and are impacted by management s judgments about the time it may take to find a suitable subtenant or assignee  or the terms under which a termination of the lease agreement may be negotiated with the landlord 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provision of sfas r  share based payment  which generally requires  among other things  that all employee share based compensation be measured using the fair value method and that all of the resulting compensation cost be recognized in the financial statements 
we selected the modified prospective method of adoption 
under this method  compensation expense that we recognized for fiscal included a compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and b compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
under sfas r  our stock compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is the vesting term 
as a result  we recognized stock option compensation expense of million during fiscal results for prior periods have not been restated 
we measure the estimated fair value of our granted stock options using a black scholes pricing model and of our restricted stock based on the fair market value of a share of registered stock on the date of the grant 
accounting for lease obligations in accordance with financial accounting standards board technical bulletin no 
 accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases  we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term commencing on the date we take possession 
we include any rent escalations on construction and other rent holidays in our straight line rent expense 
landlord allowances in accordance with financial accounting standards board technical bulleting no 
 issues relating to accounting for leases  we record landlord allowances as deferred rent in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and amortize them on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 
income taxes we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry forwards 
our determination of the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the net operating loss carryforward  based on the company s operating results 
a positive adjustment to income will be recorded in future years if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize these deferred tax assets 
revenue restaurant net sales 
our company owned and operated restaurant sales are composed almost entirely of food and beverage sales 
we record revenue at the time of the purchase of our products by our customers 

table of contents franchise fees and royalties

we recognize the franchise fee in the period in which each franchise location opens 
we recognize franchise royalties in the period in which sales are made by our franchise operators 
gift card sales 
we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase gift cards at our restaurants and through our website 
customers can purchase these cards at varying dollar amounts 
at the time of purchase by the customer  we record a gift card liability for the face value of the card purchased 
we recognize the revenue and reduce the gift card liability when the gift card is redeemed 
we do not reduce our recorded liability for potential non use of purchased gift cards

during fiscal  we entered into franchise agreements with area developers which generated upfront franchising fees of approximately million 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and expected cash flows from company owned restaurant operations and expected franchising fees and royalties will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for new restaurant construction  maintaining and remodeling existing restaurant locations  franchising initiatives and other working capital needs for the next twelve months 
additionally  we expect to continue to open new company owned restaurants in fiscal and beyond  which we also expect to fund from the same sources 
if we do not open new company owned restaurants according to our plan  if our new and existing company owned restaurants do not generate the positive cash flow that we expect  or if we do not generate the franchise fees and royalties that we currently expect  then we may seek other sources of funding or adjust the number and or the timing of new company owned restaurant openings

we have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
we invest our excess cash in investment grade  highly liquid  short term investments 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
a hypothetical one percentage point interest change from those in effect during fiscal would have resulted in interest income fluctuating by approximately million 
in fiscal and  interest income was million and million  respectively 
foreign currency risk in fiscal  all of our transactions are conducted  and our accounts are denominated  in us dollars 
accordingly  we are not exposed to foreign currency risk 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our business are food and labor costs 
some of our hourly personnel at our restaurants are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage will directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations
