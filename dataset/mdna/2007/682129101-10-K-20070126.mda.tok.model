the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
periodically  the company reviews its estimates and judgments including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  warranty obligations  litigation  environmental reserves  pensions and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements a revenue recognition sales are recognized when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  which is upon shipment 
sales are recorded net of an allowance for sales returns and rebate programs 
sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns 
the company also records estimated reductions to revenue for quantity rebates 
if the actual costs of sales returns and rebate programs significantly exceed the recorded estimated allowance  the company s sales would be adversely affected 
b allowance for doubtful accounts the company s policy is to identify all specific customers that are considered doubtful of collection based upon the customer s financial condition  payment history  credit rating and other relevant factors  and those accounts that have been turned over for collection and to reserve the portion of such accounts receivable for which collection does not appear likely 

table of contents if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts attributable to continuing operations was approximately million and million at november  and  respectively 
c allowance for inventory obsolescence the company s policy is to maintain an inventory obsolescence reserve based upon specifically identified  discontinued or obsolete items and a percentage of quantities on hand compared with usage and sales levels over the last year to two years 
the policy has been applied on a consistent basis for all years presented 
a sudden and unexpected change in design trends and or preferences for patterns  colors and or material could reduce the rate of inventory turnover and require the company to increase its reserve for obsolescence 
the reserve for inventory obsolescence  which applies primarily to our decorative products segment  was approximately million and million at november  and  respectively 
d litigation and environmental reserves the company reserves for the probable judgments associated with any claims including environmental compliance 
reserves are based upon its analyses and established at the best estimate of probable loss 
e pensions and other postretirement plans effective november   the company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
this statement requires employers to recognize in their balance sheets the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit post retirement plans  measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other post retirement plans 
employers must recognize the change in the funded status of the plan in the year in which the change occurs through accumulated other comprehensive income 
this statement also requires plan assets and obligations to be measured as of the employers balance sheet date 
the measurement provision of this statement will be effective for years beginning after december   with early application encouraged 
the company has not yet adopted the measurement provisions of this statement 
prior to the adoption of the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 the company accounted for its defined benefit post retirement plans under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
sfas no 
required that a liability minimum pension liability be recorded when the accumulated benefit obligation abo liability exceeded the fair value of plan assets 
any adjustment was recorded as a non cash charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity deficit 
sfas no 
required that the liability recorded should represent the actuarial present value of all future benefits attributable to an employee s service rendered to date 
under both sfas no 
and no 
 changes in the funded status were not immediately recognized  rather they were deferred and recognized ratably over future periods 
upon adoption of the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 the company recognized the amounts of prior changes in the funded status of its post retirement benefit plans through accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
as a result  the company recognized the following adjustments in individual line items of its consolidated balance sheet as of november  dollars in millions prior to application of sfas no 
effect of adopting sfas no 
as reported at november  prepaid pension asset postretirement benefits other than pension pension liability total liabilities accumulated other comprehensive income loss total shareholders equity deficit 
table of contents the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended november   or for any prior period presented  does not affect any financial covenants  and is not expected to affect the company s operating results in future periods 
as of november   included in accumulated other comprehensive loss was unrecognized prior service costs of million and unrecognized actuarial loss of million 
the estimated net loss and prior service cost for defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss during are million and million  respectively 
the estimated net gain and prior service cost for retiree medical plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss during are million and million  respectively 
the most significant elements in determining the company s pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension expense income 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense income 
the company recorded non cash pension expense of million and million in and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to the increases in the amortization of the net loss of million  service cost of million and a decrease in the assumed return on plan assets of million 
the increase in the amortization of the net loss and service cost was due primarily to the decrease in the discount rate used for expense determination from in to in the company anticipates non cash expense to be approximately million 
to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption  the company considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class  as well as the target allocation of the pension portfolio 
this resulted in the selection of a long term rate of return on assets assumption of for plan years and the measurement dates of august  and were used to determine these rates 
a basis point change in the assumed rate of return for assets would increase or decrease the assets by approximately million 
the company determined the discount rate to be used to discount the plan liabilities at the plan s measurement date  which was august  the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company considered rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized investment ratings agency 
changes in discount rates  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  have been recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss income as prescribed by sfas no 
with the higher interest rate environment in  the company increased the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit pension plan obligations to a discount rate of from a discount rate of in the measurement date of august  was used to determine this rate 
an increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate would decrease or increase expense on an annual basis by approximately million 
based on asset performance  interest rate and discount rate assumptions and current pension funding rules  the company does not anticipate that a cash contribution to the pension fund will be required prior to however  this funding analysis is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions and such changes may accelerate or delay the requirement to make a cash contribution 
currently  the plan has a credit balance that will cover cash contribution requirements for the next two years 
factors that could alter the cash requirements and timing of any such cash equivalents are investment returns which differ materially from the company s return assumption 
significant changes in interest rates  affecting the discount rate 
opportunities to reduce future cash requirements by accelerating contributions ahead of the minimum required schedule 
by following certain strategies  smaller contributions in the near term may prevent the need for larger 
table of contents contributions in the future 
some of those strategies might include  but are not limited to  contributions to avoid pension benefit guaranty corporation variable premiums  and maintain funded status to avoid additional funding requirements under section i of the internal revenue code 
these types of contributions would allow the company to manage the overall cash flow to the plan 
f tax valuation allowance the company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of recovery of such assets 
as of november   the company had approximately million of net deferred tax assets primarily related to domestic loss carryforwards that expire by  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment losses created as a result of the company s annual impairment test in and  the cumulative effect of an accounting change effective december   a change in the company s pension liabilities  and other temporary differences for which a full valuation allowance of million has been provided 
the company provided a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets after having considered its history of cumulative losses since its spin off from gencorp 
g stock based employee compensation prior to december   the company elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for the company s employee stock options 
under apb  because the exercise price of the stock option equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant intrinsic value method  no compensation expense was recognized 
effective december   the company adopted the fair value method of recording stock options as required by sfas no 
revised  share based payment using the modified prospective method 
under this method  compensation cost in includes the portion of awards vested in the period for all share based payments granted to but not vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and all share based payments granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value 
while the company regularly evaluates the use of share based payments  its recent practice has been to issue fewer stock options than has been issued in the past  utilizing other forms of incentives such as restricted stock  which are required to be expensed using the fair value method 
see note q to the company s consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of share based payments 
h long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  and definite lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and depreciation ceases
