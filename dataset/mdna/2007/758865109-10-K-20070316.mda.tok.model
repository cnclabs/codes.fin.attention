executive overview regent is focused on acquiring and operating in mid sized markets where approximately of every revenue dollar is locally generated 
we currently own and operate radio stations in markets 
regent stations hold the number one or two revenue positions in of our markets 
additionally  according to broadcast analysts  we are among the radio companies which have a highly concentrated average market share 
regent has out performed the industry  as reported by the radio advertising bureau  in same station net revenue growth for the past out of quarters and our radio station portfolio has been significantly upgraded with the closing of several acquisitions and dispositions in on december   we completed the largest acquisition in regent history  in terms of acquisition price  by acquiring substantially all of the broadcasting and intangible assets of five radio stations serving the buffalo  new york market from cbs radio stations inc the stations acquired include three of the top five rated stations in the buffalo market  which is currently our largest market 
we see several benefits from this acquisition less integration risk due to the sophistication of the seller  a more effective 
table of contents leveraging of corporate overhead across our radio portfolio  consistent and stable market growth over the past five years  excellent technical facilities  and product improvement opportunities on three of the five stations 
at the end of november  we completed the divestiture of radio stations serving the redding and chico  california markets for million in cash 
the transaction includes the following radio station assets knnn fm  ksha fm  krdg fm  krrx fm  kqms am  knro am  kfmf fm  kalf fm  kzap fm and kqpt fm 
regent no longer has any broadcast assets in california 
due to the fact that these were two of our smallest markets with lower operating margins  we expect to see improvement in our overall company operating margin as a result of this transaction 
in september  we consummated two strategic transactions in our peoria  illinois market  whereby we simultaneously divested three class a fm radio stations and purchased two class b fm radio stations  improving our competitive position by upgrading the strength of our signals 
the net consideration used as a result of the acquisition and disposition was approximately million 
in early january of  we completed the acquisition of wbzz fm formerly wnyq fm  serving the capital region in albany  new york for approximately million in cash  plus approximately million related to transmitter site build out expenditures 
the new station is our second strongest signal and we now own and operate five fm and one am radio station in our second largest market 
additionally  in late december of  we sold the non strategic broadcasting and intangible assets of wyng fm  serving the evansville  indiana market for million in cash 
while our primary strategy remains focused on the acquisition of radio properties  we also have employed capital to repurchase our own stock when we believed it to be beneficial to our stockholders to do so 
on august   we entered into an agreement to repurchase  shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase up to  shares of regent common stock  exercisable at per share  held by waller sutton media partners  lp for an aggregate price of approximately million 
as required by the agreement  the two representatives of the partnership serving on the company s board of directors  william h 
ingram and andrew j 
armstrong  jr  resigned effective august  in conjunction with their resignations  the two representatives surrendered their fully vested stock options to purchase regent common stock and  as a result of their resignations  all nonvested shares of regent common stock awarded to the representatives were forfeited 
excluding the waller sutton media partners shares repurchased in august  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share  for a total cost of approximately million  including commissions during we also focused on our capital structure in  as we entered into a new credit agreement to fund the acquisition of the buffalo cluster and refinance existing debt on very favorable terms 
on november   we entered into a new credit agreement with bank of america  na  and the other lenders identified in the credit agreement 
under the terms of the credit agreement  the lenders have made available to regent a senior secured credit agreement in the maximum aggregate principal amount of million  consisting of a senior secured term b loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of million  a senior secured revolving credit facility in the 
table of contents aggregate principal amount of million  and a term a loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of million 
effective february   we entered into an amendment to our new credit agreement 
the material terms of the amendment are a reduction of the applicable margin on eurodollar loans by  and a reduction of the applicable margin on base rate loans to 
in order to mitigate the impact of potential interest rate fluctuations  during the fourth quarter of  we swapped the interest rate on both the million term a loan and million term b loan from floating to fixed 
the term a loan pricing is fixed at approximately for five years and the term b loan is fixed at approximately for five years  in both cases plus the applicable margin 
we have contracted with ibiquity digital corporation ibiquity for the right to convert of our stations to digital or high definition radio hd radio 
the stations that we will convert exclude the five buffalo stations which were converted prior to our ownership 
our contract with ibiquity stipulates that we convert a predetermined number of our stations to hd radio over a six year period beginning in since inception of our hd radio rollout in  we have converted of our fm stations to hd radio  for an aggregate cost of approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million was spent during the first nine months of we did not incur any material conversion costs during the fourth quarter of as of december   including the buffalo stations  we had fm stations and one am station broadcasting in hd 
we expect to convert an additional nine fm stations in at a total cost of approximately million 
the conversion to hd radio will enable the stations to broadcast digital quality sound and also provide additional services  such as on demand traffic  weather and sports scores 
additionally  this new technology will enable each converted radio station to broadcast additional channels of programming for public  private or subscription services 
to date there has been no economic impact on our stations that have converted to hd radio 
any future economic benefit to our stations as a result of digital conversion is not known at this time 
in  we launched regent interactive  an initiative focused on generating revenues associated with our station websites 
while the revenue and operating income from regent interactive was immaterial to the company in  we are seeking to aggressively grow this business component in and beyond 
in our albany  new york market  new programming began in late december of  on wqbk fm and wqbj fm  which had previously carried the howard stern show 
the loss of the howard stern show was the primary factor for the decrease in albany s net broadcast revenue for the year ended compared to the same period in the revenue decrease was mitigated somewhat by the elimination of approximately million in annual program rights fees associated with airing the howard stern show 
as a result of our annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets  we recorded approximately million of expense related to impairment of our fcc licenses and goodwill 
in evaluating the fair value of our fcc licenses  we utilized a discounted cash flow analysis which incorporates variables such as revenue  revenue share projections  projected operating profit margins and a discount rate 
the variables used in our analysis reflect industry performance norms  as well as the anticipated performance of the radio stations 
to evaluate the impairment of goodwill  we used a market multiple approach commonly used as a valuation technique in the broadcast industry 
the fcc license and goodwill impairment was due to a combination of factors  including the adjustment of certain metrics used to measure the discounted cash flow utilized in the valuation  and the adjustment of cash flow multiples to reflect current industry conditions 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our accounting estimates  the most significant of which include establishing allowances for doubtful accounts  allocating the purchase price of acquisitions  evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets  determining the recoverability of our long lived assets  and evaluating our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the basis for our estimates are historical experience and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  given the available information at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as pervasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast  and the revenue is recorded net of advertising agency commission 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets our fcc licenses qualify as indefinite lived intangible assets  and represent a significant portion of the assets on our balance sheet 
we utilize the greenfield methodology for valuation of our fcc licenses  which allocates a start up value to each station and employs a discounted cash flow methodology and accepted appraisal techniques 
to test goodwill  we utilize a market multiple approach at the reporting unit level 
local economic conditions in each of our markets could impact whether an fcc license or goodwill is impaired  as a decrease or increase in market revenue could negatively or positively impact discounted cash flows 
additionally  other factors such as interest rates  the performance of the s p  cash flow multiples as well as capital expenditures  can affect the discounted cash flow analysis 
to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets  an impairment loss will be recorded in operating income 
allocation of acquisition purchase price and valuation of acquired intangible assets we believe the determination of the fair value of our acquired intangible assets is a critical accounting policy as their value is significant relative to our total assets 
we typically engage independent third parties to assist in our appraisal of the fair value of our acquired tangible and intangible assets  however  in some instances we apply our own direct valuation methods to determine the value of tangible assets  fcc licenses  and other intangible assets 
the critical assumptions we use in the valuation of our intangible assets include assumptions about market growth  cash flow growth  multiples of cash flow  and other economic factors 
determining the recoverability of long lived assets our long lived assets to be held and used fixed assets and definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset 
if we were to determine that the carrying amount of an asset was not recoverable  we would record an impairment loss for the difference 
table of contents between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
we determine the fair value of our long lived assets based upon the market value of similar assets  if available  or independent appraisals  if necessary 
long lived assets to be disposed of and or held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell 
we determine the fair value of these assets in the same manner as described for assets held and used 
deferred tax assets at december   we had current and non current deferred tax assets of approximately million before valuation allowance  the primary component of which is our net operating loss carryforwards 
while we have a valuation allowance of approximately million established for tax assets expiring through  we have determined that it is not necessary to record a valuation allowance against our net operating loss carryforwards that expire in years through  based on estimated future taxable income during those years 
our estimated future taxable income in those periods takes into consideration the anticipated future run off of significant tax amortization related to existing fcc licenses and tax deductible goodwill by however  there is no assurance that our projections will be achieved  and if our taxable income projections fall short  we most likely would need to record an additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that would not be utilized 
the need to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is reviewed quarterly  and if we were to determine that we would be unable to realize a portion  or the remainder of the deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be recorded as expense in the period such determination was made 
additionally  if it were determined that we would be able to utilize a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards that are currently reduced by a valuation allowance  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense 
if our provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate due to unfavorable law changes or unforeseen circumstances  we could experience expenses in excess of the current or deferred income tax provisions we have established 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we routinely review customer account activity in order to assess the adequacy of the allowances provided for potential losses 
based on historical information  we believe that our allowance is adequate 
however  changes in general economic  business and market conditions could affect the ability of our customers to make their required payments  therefore  the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated as new information is received 
a one percent change to our allowance as a percent of our outstanding accounts receivable at december  would cause a decrease in net income of approximately million  net of tax

this commentary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes included herein 
our financial results are seasonal 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  we expect our first calendar quarter to produce the lowest revenues for the year  and the fourth calendar quarter to produce the highest revenues for the year 
our operating results in any period may be affected by advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of the advertising and promotion is realized in future periods 
compared to results of continuing operations for the year ended december  compared to december  were impacted by several factors 
revenue was positively impacted by approximately million of political revenues that were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of compared to the same quarters of results were also positively impacted by the operations related to the buffalo cluster which we began operating october

the increase in programming expense was due primarily to increased compensation expense  music license fees and research costs which were partially offset by a savings in program rights related to the howard stern show which was replaced in albany  new york by a new morning show 
the increased promotion expense was due to promotional expenses associated with the launching of two new stations in our peoria  illinois market and one new station and three new formats in our albany  new york market 
sales expense increased due primarily to compensation costs related to increased revenue  as well as increased rating service costs 
administrative expense was higher due to increased overhead expense related to increased franchise tax expenses  increased bad debt expense  payroll tax expense due to increased salaries and increased non cash compensation related to the issuance of restricted stock 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased  from approximately million in to million in amortization increased by approximately million related to the amortization of certain definite lived intangible assets from the acquisition of the buffalo and peoria stations in the second half of the increase was partially offset by lower amortization in bloomington due to certain definite lived intangibles which became fully amortized in depreciation expense decreased by approximately million in  due primarily to certain assets which became fully depreciated in corporate expense corporate general and administrative expense decreased from approximately million in to million in the expense includes approximately million related to the retirement package for the company s former ceo and chairman of the board  who retired as of september  an increase in non cash compensation expense of approximately million in was related to the issuance of restricted stock 

table of contents impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets in conjunction with our annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we determined that the fair value of goodwill and fcc licenses for certain markets were less than the carrying values recorded in our financial statements 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of the fcc license and goodwill impairment was due to a combination of factors  including the adjustment of certain metrics used to measure the discounted cash flow utilized in the valuation  and the adjustment of cash flow multiples to reflect current industry conditions 
in  we recorded pre tax impairment of fcc licenses and goodwill of approximately million 
local marketing agreement fee from october  through december   we paid total fees of approximately million to operate the buffalo stations under a local marketing agreement 
the fees represented a financing cost associated with receiving the financial benefits of operating the stations prior to assuming ownership

interest rates increased due to a combination of libor rate increases  combined with higher margins applicable to our borrowings under the new credit agreement 
the increases in outstanding borrowings during the year were related to borrowings of approximately million during the first nine months of to fund the repurchase of shares under our stock buyback program  and borrowings under our new credit agreement to fund the purchase of our buffalo  new york stations 
our average debt level in was approximately million  compared to approximately million in other income  net in  we recorded approximately million of investment income  related primarily to earnings on the escrow payment we made to secure our obligation under the buffalo asset purchase agreement
