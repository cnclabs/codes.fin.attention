inhibitex  mscramm  veronate  and aurexis are registered trademarks of inhibitex  inc mscramm is an acronym for microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules 
overview we are a development stage company that is focused on the development and commercialization of anti infective products that can diagnose  prevent and treat serious infections 
since our inception in may  we have generated significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
from our inception in to march   we devoted substantially all of our resources and efforts towards the discovery and development of novel antibody based products for the prevention and treatment of serious bacterial and fungal infections  all of which were based upon our proprietary mscramm protein platform 
in november  we completed enrollment of a  patient pivotal phase iii clinical trial of veronate  our lead product candidate at that time  which we had been developing for the prevention of certain hospital associated infections in premature  very low birth weight infants 
on april   we announced that this pivotal phase iii trial did not achieve its primary endpoint or any of its secondary endpoints 
in light of these phase iii trial results  in april we discontinued the development of veronate  reduced our work force and realigned our operations consistent with the status of other mscramm based development programs 
in addition  after a comprehensive review of the entire veronate program and an internal assessment of our pipeline  assets  resources and capabilities we adopted a strategy to preserve a significant portion of our financial resources  in order to pursue other pre clinical or clinical stage development product candidates beyond our mscramm platform via in licensing  acquisition or merger activities 
we have not yet completed such a transaction 
while we are in various stages of discussions associated with these efforts  we cannot determine when  if ever  we will be successful in implementing this strategy 
pursuant to this strategy  while we continue with preclinical work on aurexis and continue to support our mscramm partnering programs  and have in fact recently entered into an out licensing arrangement for diagnostic aspects of our mscramm platform  we suspended the initiation of additional clinical trials of aurexis and any of our other mscramm based programs pending the outcome of these strategically focused activities 
however  we plan to continue to leverage our capabilities and intellectual property related to our mscramm protein platform to pursue corporate collaborations that could provide financial and other synergistic capabilities to support the further development of these programs and maximize their potential 

table of contents we have neither received regulatory approval for any of our product candidates  nor do we have any commercialization capabilities  therefore it is possible that we may never successfully derive any commercial revenues from any of our existing or future product candidates or preclinical programs 
we believe there is opportunity to utilize our expertise in mscramm proteins to collaborate on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel antibody based products that address the increasing prevalence of life threatening hospital associated infections and the lack of effective therapies currently available to treat these infections 
the human immune system normally protects the body against a variety of infections and other illnesses by recognizing  neutralizing and eliminating pathogens and malignant cells from the body 
one of the primary functions of the immune system is the production of antibodies 
antibodies are soluble proteins found in the plasma portion of whole blood capable of recognizing and binding to pathogens that are potentially harmful to the human body 
antibodies recognize and attach themselves  or bind to antigens  examples of which include mscramm proteins present on the surface of bacteria and fungi 
in order for an effective immune response to occur without harming normal cells  the immune system generates antibodies that recognize and bind tightly to one specific antigen 
once an antibody binds to its targeted antigen  it triggers the cellular components of the immune system to clear the pathogen from the body 
we have identified antibodies that specifically bind to a number of different mscramm proteins located on the surface of certain pathogenic organisms 
mscramm proteins enable organisms to initiate and maintain an infection by adhering to specific binding sites within human tissue or to implanted or in dwelling materials  such as orthopedic implants  catheters and vascular grafts 
we believe that antibodies that target mscramm proteins can reduce the incidence and severity of bacterial and fungal infections through two important biological mechanisms of action 
first  by binding to the mscramm proteins  these antibodies inhibit or block the invading organism from attaching to tissue  or implanted or in dwelling medical devices 
second  these antibodies can cover or coat the invading organism  identifying it for clearance by other cellular components of the immune system through a process commonly referred to as opsonization 
we believe that antibody based products developed utilizing our mscramm proteins may provide the following advantages over existing anti infective therapies the ability to be used prophylactically in patients where the preventive use of antibiotics is not appropriate or recommended  improve patient outcomes by reducing the incidence of secondary site infections  relapse rates  mortality and length of hospital stay  a lower likelihood of inducing patterns of drug resistance due to their novel mechanisms of action  and fewer side effects

staphylococcal vaccine active immunity against staphylococcal infections preclinical wyeth diagnostic for bacterial and fungal pathogens diagnostic products for staphylococcal infections clinical m company aurexis aurexis is a humanized monoclonal antibody being developed as a first line therapy  in combination with antibiotics  for the treatment of serious  life threatening s 
aureus bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients 
aurexis targets clfa  an mscramm protein found on the surface of virtually all strains of s 
aureus 
in may we completed a patient phase ii trial of aurexis in patients with confirmed s 
aureus bloodstream infections 
we plan to seek future corporate collaborations that can provide financial resources and other synergistic capabilities to support the further development of aurexis prior to advancing it into late stage clinical development 
aurexis has been granted fast track designation by the fda for the adjunctive treatment of s 
aureus bloodstream infections 
market opportunity for the treatment of s 
aureus infections s 
aureus is one of the leading causes of hospital associated infections 
based on data compiled by the cdc  an estimated  s 
aureus infections occur in the united states annually 
we estimate  based on compiled data  that approximately  to  of these s 
aureus infections are bloodstream infections 
we are developing aurexis to be used adjunctively as a first line therapy to treat s 
aureus bloodstream infections 
we also believe that the degree to which the medical community may adopt the use of aurexis  if and when it is approved by the fda will be based primarily on its ability to reduce the incidence of infection associated mortality  the relapse rate associated with these infections  the frequency of related secondary site infections  and the number of days that patients with such infections stay in the intensive care unit or hospital 
aurexis clinical trials phase ii 
in may  we reported results from a patient phase ii trial of aurexis  in combination with antibiotics  for the treatment of documented s 
aureus bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients 
patients were randomized to receive antibiotic therapy in combination with either aurexis  at mg kg  or placebo 
both aurexis and the placebo were administered intravenously as a single dose 
in this trial  standard of care antibiotic therapy was selected by the individual investigators 
subjects were followed for days or until early termination from the trial 
the primary objectives of the phase ii trial were to evaluate the safety of a single administration of aurexis  the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of aurexis  and the biological activity of a single dose of aurexis 
favorable trends were observed in the composite primary endpoint of mortality  relapse rate and infection related complications  and a number of secondary endpoints and ad hoc analyses  including the progression in the severity of sepsis  the number of days in the intensive care unit  and the resolution of complications due to s 
aureus bacteremia 
these preliminary findings were not statistically significant 
the phase ii trial was not powered or designed to demonstrate statistically significant differences among the treatment arms in measures of efficacy 
we cannot guarantee that the results of subsequent trials will be similar to the findings of the phase ii trial 

table of contents phase i 
in may  we reported the completion of an eight patient phase i clinical trial of aurexis to evaluate its safety and pharmacokinetics in patients with end stage renal disease esrd 
based on the pharmacokinetic data from this trial  we intend to include patients with esrd in any follow on trials of aurexis for the treatment of documented s 
aureus bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients 
in  we completed an open label  randomized  dose escalating phase i clinical trial in healthy volunteers to assess the safety of aurexis and determine dose related pharmacokinetics 
patients were intravenously administered four dose levels of aurexis at    or mg kg 
the volunteers were monitored for a period of days subsequent to the administration of the drug 
safety was monitored by physical examinations  clinical and laboratory tests  and adverse experience assessments 
the following adverse events were noted among participants headache  low white blood cell count  gastro esophageal reflux and red rash 
none of these adverse events was severe or believed to be definitely related to aurexis 
no other safety issues were identified and no dose reached the protocol specified definition of maximum tolerated dose 
pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that doses of mg kg or greater achieved plasma levels of aurexis associated with therapeutic efficacy in preclinical animal models 
the half life of aurexis was determined to be approximately days 
we selected the mg kg dose for our phase ii trial of aurexis 
other product candidates in addition to aurexis  we currently have a number of other product candidates in preclinical development  all of which are based on the use of mscramm proteins 
however  based on our strategy to preserve a significant portion of our financial resources to pursue other anti infective preclinical and clinical stage development programs beyond our mscramm platform via in licensing  acquisition or merger activities we have reduced the amount of committed resources to these programs pending the outcome of our strategically focused activities 
candida monoclonal antibodies candida albicans  or c 
albicans  is the causative organism of the majority of invasive fungal infections in an expanding population of immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients such as those undergoing chemotherapy  with organ transplants or with aids 
we have identified and characterized mscramm proteins on the surface of c 
albicans and we have generated monoclonal antibodies that target these proteins 
staphylococcus epidermidis monoclonal antibodies staphylococcus epidermidis s 
epidermidis is often reported as the most frequent isolate among coagulase negative staphylococci or cons  which are a major constituent of the normal flora on human skin 
although often considered a contaminant of blood cultures  s 
epidermidis is now recognized as an opportunistic pathogen and is one of the leading causes of hospital associated blood stream infections  or bacteremia 
we have identified a panel of mscramm proteins expressed by s 
epidermidis 
humanized monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize these mscramm proteins have been produced and evaluated in a series of in vitro preclinical studies 
staphylococcal vaccine there are a number of patient groups  including approximately  end stage renal disease patients in the united states  patients receiving chronic long term care  and patients undergoing certain elective surgeries  who are at risk of acquiring a staphylococcal infection 
for these high risk groups  we believe an active vaccine that can enhance immunity against staphylococcal organisms may be a less costly and preferred mode of therapy 
we have entered into a license and collaboration agreement with wyeth to develop human vaccines against staphylococcal organisms 
enterococcal monoclonal antibodies we have identified and characterized mscramm protein targets expressed by enterococci and we have generated monoclonal antibodies that recognize these targets 
in october  we entered into an agreement 
table of contents with dyax to collaborate on the discovery  development  and commercialization of fully human monoclonal antibodies against mscramm proteins on enterococci 
under the terms of the agreement  we and dyax will jointly develop product candidates that may be identified during the collaboration and will share in the costs to develop any resulting product candidates and the commercialization rights and profits from any marketed products 
during the first half of  we anticipate that we and dyax will make a determination as to whether to advance the collaborative program to the next stage of development 
diagnostic products on january   we announced that we had entered into a license and commercialization agreement with m company or m for the development of various diagnostic products using our mscramm protein platform 
under the terms of the agreement  we granted m an exclusive global license to use clumping factor a clfa  an mscramm protein  in the development of diagnostic products 
we also granted m a license to use additional mscramm protein targets for the development of other diagnostic products 
in exchange for these licenses  we are entitled to receive future milestone payments  financial support of further research and development activities and royalty payments on product sales 
our strategy our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes anti infective products that can diagnose  prevent and treat serious infections 
in order to achieve this goal  we are focused on the following key strategies expand our product portfolio through in licensing  acquisitions or merger 
we are seeking in licensing  acquisition or merger opportunities for various preclinical and clinical drug development programs 
while we are in various stages of discussions associated with this initiative  we cannot determine when  if ever  we will be successful in implementing this component of our strategy 
such a transaction or combination of transactions may result in our current stockholders not owning a majority of our shares 
advance the development of aurexis through collaboration or collaborations 
we are developing aurexis as a first line therapy for the treatment of serious s 
aureus infections in combination with antibiotics 
we have evaluated aurexis in a phase ii clinical trial in patients with s 
aureus bloodstream infections 
we intend to pursue corporate collaborations that can provide financial and other synergistic capabilities to support the further development of aurexis prior to advancing it into later stage clinical development 
we  or our collaborators  may also choose to evaluate aurexis in other indications in the future 
preserve a significant portion of our financial resources in order to pursue and fund other preclinical or clinical stage development programs we may acquire 
in order to preserve our financial resources to fund the future development of any development programs we may obtain through in licensing  acquisition or merger activities  we have reduced the amount of resources committed to the development of our mscramm based programs  and do not intend to advance any of these programs into clinical development without a corporate collaborator 
sales and marketing we currently have limited  if any  commercialization capabilities  and it is possible that we may never successfully commercialize or sell any of our existing or future product candidates 
we anticipate partnering or collaborating with other companies to further develop and commercialize our existing mscramm based product candidates 
we intend to evaluate whether or not we may independently commercialize any future drug development programs we acquire through in licensing  acquisition or merger activities on a case by case basis 
manufacturing we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities 
historically  we have outsourced the manufacture of our clinical trial materials 
we anticipate that we will continue to rely on qualified contract manufacturers for 
table of contents the manufacture of any materials we may use in the clinical development of product candidates for the foreseeable future 
we have used a contract manufacturer  avid bioservices  inc  or avid  to produce clinical trial material for use in our phase i and ii clinical trials of aurexis 
as of december   we have no long term obligations under any of our prior agreements with avid to manufacture additional clinical trial material for our aurexis program 
in november  we entered into an agreement with lonza biologics plc  or lonza  for the manufacture of a second clone of aurexis 
under the terms of the agreement  lonza agreed to perform numerous process development related services and manufacture a cgmp lot of aurexis for potential use in future clinical trials  which they have completed 
as of december   we have no long term obligations under this agreement 
in april  we terminated our agreement with nabi biopharmaceuticals  inc or nabi for the manufacture of clinical trial materials used in the development of veronate 
in february  an arbitrator determined that we were liable to nabi for million of cancellation fees associated with our termination of the agreement 
competition our industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change 
significant competitive factors in our industry include  among others  product efficacy and safety  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals  government reimbursement rates for and the average selling price of products  the availability of raw materials and qualified manufacturing capacity  manufacturing costs  intellectual property and patent rights and their protection  and sales and marketing capabilities 
obtaining product candidates or development programs via in license  acquisition or merger is a highly competitive activity 
many organizations  including large pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  as well as other smaller life science companies  continue to seek to acquire these types of programs and the development and commercialization of anti infective therapies as a strategy 
many of these organizations have substantially more capital resources than we have  and greater capabilities and experience in negotiating and consummating licensing  acquisition or merger agreements 
further  any product candidates that we may obtain  successfully develop and receive approval for sale by the fda or similar regulatory authorities in other countries may compete with existing products and product candidates that may be approved in the future 
many organizations  including large pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies have substantially more capital resources than we have  and greater capabilities and experience in basic research  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  regulatory affairs  manufacturing  marketing and sales 
as a result  we may face competitive disadvantages relative to these organizations should they develop or commercialize a competitive product 
therefore  we cannot assure you that any of our product candidates  if ever approved for sale  will compete successfully and that another organization will not succeed in developing and commercializing products that render our technology or product candidates non competitive or obsolete 
further  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in in licensing  acquisition or merger 
intellectual property rights and patents we own or are have licensed numerous issued united states patents and pending patent applications  as well as corresponding international filings in the field of mscramm and surface adhesions 
the issued united states patents expire between and in addition to our patents and patent applications  we have registered trademarks for inhibitex  mscramm  aurexis and veronate 
of the patents and applications in our portfolio  a number are considered critical to the development of aurexis our two united states clfa patents are directed to the dna encoding clfa and the clfa mscramm protein on s 
aureus 
these patents will expire in and  respectively  if not extended 
the clfa protein is the protein recognized by the aurexis monoclonal antibody 
there are no corresponding foreign rights available for the clfa protein and nucleic acid sequences 

table of contents our pending united states clfa patent application claims antibodies to the clfa protein 
our united states clfa monoclonal antibody patent relates to aurexis and contains claims to monoclonal antibodies recognizing the clfa protein 
this patent will expire in if not extended 
corresponding international applications are pending 
patent and other proprietary rights are important in our business and for the development of our product candidates 
we have sought  and intend to continue to seek patent protection for our inventions and rely upon patents  trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain a competitive advantage 
in order to protect these rights  know how and trade secrets  we typically require employees  consultants  collaborators and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements with us  generally stating that they will not disclose any confidential information about us to third parties for a certain period of time  and will otherwise not use confidential information for anyone s benefit but ours 
the patent positions of companies like ours involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  their enforceability cannot be predicted with any certainty 
our issued patents  those licensed to us  and those that may be issued to us in the future may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and the rights granted thereunder may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us 
because of the extensive time required for development  testing and regulatory review of a potential product  it is possible that  before any of our product candidates can be approved for sale and commercialized  our relevant patent rights may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization 
expiration of patents we own or license could adversely affect our ability to protect future product development and  consequently  our operating results and financial position 
licensing and collaborative agreements to date  we have entered into a number of license and collaborative agreements with various institutions to obtain intellectual property rights and patents relating to mscramm proteins and our product candidates 
we have also entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with wyeth with respect to their use of our mscramm protein intellectual property to develop human staphylococcal vaccines  a joint development agreement with dyax for the discovery  development  and commercialization of therapeutic products for the treatment of infections caused by enterococci  and a diagnostic license and commercialization agreement with m to develop certain diagnostic products using the mscramm protein platform 
our strategy includes pursuing in licensing  acquisition or merger opportunities to obtain additional product candidates or programs 
we also intend to pursue collaborations with companies that may utilize our intellectual property in their products  or develop  co develop  market and sell our product candidates 
collaborations wyeth in august  we entered into a license and development collaboration agreement with wyeth for the development of human staphylococcal vaccines 
under the terms of this agreement  we granted wyeth an exclusive worldwide license to our mscramm protein intellectual property with respect to human vaccines against staphylococcal organisms 
the development  manufacture and sale of any products resulting from the collaboration will be the responsibility of wyeth 
we may terminate this agreement if wyeth fails to use reasonable commercial efforts to bring related products to market 
wyeth may terminate the agreement without cause on six months notice 
otherwise  this agreement will terminate upon the expiration of all of the licensed patents in pursuant to this agreement  we have received million in an upfront license fee and annual research support payments from wyeth as of december  we are entitled to receive minimum research support payments of million per year until the first commercial sale of any product developed under this agreement 
the minimum annual research payment we receive from wyeth increases to million if wyeth does not initiate a phase i trial by july  we are also entitled to receive milestone payments upon the filing of an investigational new drug application  or ind  the commencement of both phase ii and phase iii clinical trials  the filing of a biologics license application  or bla  and fda approval of a licensed 
table of contents product 
if all such milestones are achieved relative to one or more licensed products  we would be entitled to receive a minimum of million in milestone payments from wyeth 
the maximum milestone payments we could receive with respect to all licensed products are million 
finally  we are also entitled to royalties on net sales of licensed products manufactured  sold or distributed by wyeth 
dyax in october  we entered into a collaboration agreement with dyax to co develop monoclonal antibodies to prevent or treat serious infections caused by enterococci 
under the terms of the agreement  we and dyax have agreed to collaborate and share in the costs to perform preclinical research and development activities intended to identify and select a fully human monoclonal antibody  or antibodies  against mscramm proteins located on the surface of enterococci  that we could jointly advance into clinical development 
during this preclinical phase  we and dyax are responsible only for our respective internal development costs 
accordingly  neither party is responsible to make any upfront payments to the other party  nor is either party obligated to make future milestone or royalty payments to the other party at this time 
if at the end of the collaborative preclinical development activities  we mutually agree to advance one or more human monoclonal antibodies into clinical trials  we expect to continue to share in the clinical development costs of any such product candidates 
the agreement also contemplates that we would share in the commercialization rights and profits from any approved and marketed products resulting from the collaboration 
in the event that the parties mutually agree that the collaboration has been unable to identify a suitable monoclonal antibody to advance into clinical development  the collaboration agreement will immediately and automatically terminate without any further obligations to either party 
otherwise  this agreement can only be terminated during the initial preclinical development phase upon the mutual consent of both parties  or by one party in the event that the other party has committed a material breach  or filed for insolvency or bankruptcy 
during the first half of  we anticipate that we and dyax will collectively make a determination on whether or not to advance the collaboration program to clinical stage of development 
m company in january we entered into an exclusive worldwide license and commercialization agreement with m for the development of various diagnostic products using our mscramm protein platform 
under the terms of the agreement  we granted m exclusive global licenses to use mscramm protein intellectual property in the development of diagnostic products in exchange for license fees  future milestone payments  financial support of future research and development activities and royalty payments on net product sales 
the development  manufacture and sale of any products resulting from the collaboration are the responsibility of m 
we may terminate this agreement if m fails to use certain reasonable commercial efforts to bring related products to the market 
m may terminate the agreement  without cause upon three month written notice  upon payment of all license fees  development support for the calendar year  reimbursement of certain patent expenses  and any other amounts potentially due upon the termination of the agreement 
either party may terminate the agreement for cause upon providing two months written notice 
otherwise  this agreement will terminate upon the expiration of all licensed patents 
under the agreement  we are entitled to receive the following i nonrefundable license fees of million  of which million is due within days and the balance in the first quarter of  ii million in development support payments over the next two years  iii milestone payments on the first commercial sale of each a certain staphylococcal aureus s 
aureus diagnostic product and b other mscramm targets that detect organisms other than s

pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement in both the united states and foreign markets  any revenue associated with our products will depend largely upon the availability of reimbursement from third party payers 
third party payers include various government health authorities such as the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  which administers medicare and medicaid in the united states  managed care providers  private health insurers and other organizations 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services  including pharmaceuticals 
in addition  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products 
our products may ultimately not be considered cost effective  and adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to support a profitable operation or generate an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
the united states and foreign governments periodically propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare 
accordingly  legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before any of our product candidates are ever approved for marketing 
adoption of new legislation could further limit reimbursement for pharmaceuticals 
in addition  an increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states has and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing 
the marketability of our products may suffer if the government and other third party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement rates for our product candidates 
we intend to obtain coverage and reimbursement from these third party payers for any of our products that may be approved for sale  however  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining adequate coverage  reimbursement  or pricing  if any 
regulatory matters overview the preclinical and clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  storage  distribution  promotion  sale and export  reporting and record keeping of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states  principally the fda and corresponding state agencies  and regulatory agencies in foreign countries 
non compliance with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  seizure of products  total or partial suspension of product manufacturing and marketing  failure of the government to grant approval  withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution 

table of contents united states regulatory approval pursuant to fda regulations  we are required to undertake a long and rigorous development process before any of our product candidates may be marketed or sold in the united states 
this regulatory process typically includes the following general steps the completion of satisfactory preclinical laboratory and animal studies under the fda s good laboratory practices regulation  the development and demonstration of manufacturing processes which conform to fda mandated current good manufacturing practices  or cgmps  the submission and acceptance of an ind which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  obtaining the approval of institutional review boards  or irbs  at each site where we plan to conduct a clinical trial to protect the welfare and rights of human subjects in clinical trials  the successful completion of a series of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety  purity  potency and efficacy of any product candidate for its intended use  which conform to the fda s good clinical practice regulations  and the submission to  and review and approval by the fda of a biologics license application  or bla  or for non biologic pharmaceutical products  a new drug application  or nda  prior to any commercial sale or shipment of a product 
successfully completing this development process requires a substantial amount of time and financial resources 
we cannot assure you or be certain that this process will result in the granting of an approval for any of our product candidates on a timely basis  if at all 
preclinical testing preclinical tests generally include laboratory evaluation of a product candidate  its chemistry  formulation  stability and toxicity  as well as certain animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy 
we must submit the results of these preclinical tests  together with manufacturing information  analytical data and the clinical trial protocol  to the fda as part of an ind  which must become effective before we may begin any human clinical trials 
an ind automatically becomes effective days after receipt by the fda  unless the fda  within this day time period  raises concerns or questions about the intended conduct of the trials and imposes what is referred to as a clinical hold 
if one or more of our product candidates is placed on clinical hold  we would be required to resolve any outstanding issues to the satisfaction of the fda before we could begin  or continue clinical trials 
preclinical studies generally take several years to complete  and there is no guarantee that an ind based on those studies will become effective  allowing clinical testing to begin 
in addition to fda review of an ind  each medical site that desires to participate in a proposed clinical trial must have the clinical protocol reviewed and approved by an independent irb 
the irb considers  among other things  ethical factors  and the selection and safety of human subjects 
clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the fda s good clinical practices requirements 
clinical trials human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases phase i 
in phase i clinical trials  a product candidate is typically introduced either into healthy human subjects or patients with the medical condition for which the new drug is intended to be used 
generally the main purpose of a phase i trial is to assess a product candidate s safety and the ability of the human body to tolerate the product candidate 
absorption  metabolism  distribution and pharmacokinetic trials are also generally performed at this stage 

table of contents phase ii 
during this phase  a product candidate is generally studied in an exploratory trial or trials in a limited number of patients with the disease or medical condition for which it is intended to be used in order to i further identify any possible adverse side effects and safety risks  ii assess the preliminary or potential efficacy or biologic activity of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases or medical conditions  and iii assess dosage tolerance and determine the optimal dose for a subsequent phase ii or phase iii trial 
phase ii trials generally involve patients who are divided into one or more groups that will get one of several dose levels of the product candidate  and a control group that will not be treated with the product candidate and may receive a placebo 
phase iii 
if and when one or more phase ii trials demonstrate that a specific dose or range of doses of a product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile  one or more phase iii trials are generally undertaken to further demonstrate or confirm clinical efficacy and to further evaluate safety in an expanded patient population with the goal of evaluating the overall risk benefit relationship of the product candidate 
phase iii trials will generally be designed to reach a specific goal or endpoint  the achievement of which is intended to demonstrate the product candidate s potential clinical efficacy 
the successful demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety in one or more phase iii trials is typically a prerequisite to the filing of a bla or a nda for a product candidate 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully complete any phase i  phase ii or phase iii trials of our product candidates within any specific time period  if at all 
furthermore  we  the fda  an irb  or a data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health or safety risk 
biologics license or new drug applications if and when our clinical trials are completed with satisfactory clinical data we must submit a bla or nda to the fda in order to obtain approval for the marketing and sale of a product candidate 
among many other items  a bla typically includes a description of the manufacturing process and quality control methods  as well as the results of preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials 
the fda must approve the bla or nda prior to the marketing and sale of the related product 
the fda may deny a bla or nda if all applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional data  including clinical  toxicology  safety or manufacturing data 
it can take several years for the fda to approve a bla or nda once it is submitted  and the actual time required for any product candidate may vary substantially  depending upon the nature  complexity and novelty of the product candidate 
we cannot be certain that the fda  or any other similar regulatory agency in other countries  will grant approval for any of our product candidates on a timely basis  if at all 
success in preclinical or early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
even if such regulatory approval is granted  additional post marketing  or clinical trials  may be required that would add additional product development costs beyond those incurred through phase iii testing 
the fda generally requires products with fast track status  such as aurexis  to be further evaluated for safety in additional clinical trials 
post approval regulations if and when a product candidate receives regulatory approval  the approval is typically limited to specific clinical indications 
further  even after regulatory approval is obtained  subsequent discovery of previously unknown safety problems with a product may result in restrictions on its use or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market 
any fda approved products manufactured or distributed by us are subject to continuing regulation by the fda  including record keeping requirements and reporting of adverse events or experiences 
further  drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the fda and state agencies  and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and state agencies for compliance with cgmp  which impose rigorous procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers 
manufacturers of biologics must also comply with the fda s general biological standards 
we cannot be certain that we  or our present or future contract manufacturers or suppliers  will be able to comply with cgmp regulations and other fda regulatory requirements 
failure to comply with these 
table of contents requirements may result in  among other things  total or partial suspension of production activities  failure of the fda to grant approval for marketing  and withdrawal  suspension  or revocation of marketing approvals 
if the fda approves one or more of our product candidates  we and our contract manufacturers must provide the fda with certain updated safety  efficacy  and manufacturing information 
product changes  as well as certain changes in the manufacturing process or facilities where the manufacturing occurs or other post approval changes may necessitate additional fda review and approval 
the labeling  advertising  promotion  marketing and distribution of a drug or biologic product must also comply with fda and federal trade commission  or ftc  requirements which include  among others  standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising  off label promotion  industry sponsored scientific and educational activities  and promotional activities involving the internet 
the fda and ftc have very broad enforcement authority  and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties  including the issuance of a warning letter directing the company to correct deviations from regulatory standards and enforcement actions that can include seizures  fines  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
the fda s policies may change in the future and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates 
moreover  increased attention to the containment of health care costs in the united states and in foreign markets could result in new government regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we cannot predict the likelihood  nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action  either in the united states or abroad  or the impact such changes could have on our business 
fast track drug status aurexis has received fast track status as provided for under various fda regulations 
if our other product candidates meet the criteria  we may also apply for fast track status for such product candidates 
the fda has developed fast track policies  which provide for the potential for expedited review of a bla  or nda 
however  there is no assurance that the fda will  in fact  accelerate the review process for a fast track product candidate 
fast track status is provided only for those new and novel therapies that are intended to treat persons with life threatening and severely debilitating diseases where there is a defined unmet medical need  especially where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or the new therapy is significantly superior to alternative therapies 
during the development of product candidates that qualify for this status  the fda may expedite consultations and reviews of these experimental therapies 
fast track status also provides for the potential for a priority review  whereby the fda agrees to reduce the time it takes to review a bla or nda 
the fda can base approval of a marketing application for a fast track product on a clinical endpoint or on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit 
the fda generally requires as a condition of the approval of an application for certain fast track products  additional post approval studies or phase iv clinical studies to validate the surrogate endpoint or confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint 
further  fast track status allows for a rolling bla or nda submission  whereby portions of the application can be submitted to the fda for review prior to the completion of the entire application 
a rolling submission could result in a reduction in the length of time it would otherwise take the fda to complete its review of the application 
fast track status may be revoked by the fda at any time if the clinical results of a trial fail to continue to support the assertion that the respective product candidate has the potential to address an unmet medical need 
in addition fast track status may be granted for a specific application of a drug candidate 
foreign regulatory approval outside of the united states  our ability to market any of our existing or future product candidates will also be contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate foreign regulatory authorities whether or not fda approval has been obtained 
the foreign regulatory approval process in most industrialized countries generally includes risks that are similar with the fda approval process we have described herein 
the requirements governing conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorizations  and the time required to obtain requisite approvals may vary widely from country to country and differ from that required for fda approval

table of contents item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following discussion of risks  together with the other information contained in this form k 
the occurrence of any of the following risks could materially harm our business  our financial condition  and our ability to raise additional capital in the future or ever become profitable 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 
risks relating to our business in light of the results of our pivotal phase iii veronate clinical trial in april and the findings from an extensive review of the entire veronate program  we have adopted a strategy to pursue other preclinical and clinical development opportunities through in licensing  acquisition or merger in order to balance our development pipeline 
we also intend to preserve our cash resources by reducing the amount we invest in our mscramm based development programs  and seek collaborative partners 
we may be unable to identify and obtain product candidates or programs  or otherwise implement this strategy on a timely basis  if at all  which could harm our business 
we cannot determine when  if ever  we will be successful in implementing this strategy 
the number of pre clinical or clinical stage development programs available by way of in licensing  acquisition or merger is limited  and there are numerous other large pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies competing to obtain these same opportunities 
many of these companies have greater capital resources  experience and capabilities than we have 
we may not be able to successfully identify or execute a transaction for any suitable in licensing  acquisition or merger candidates  or we may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us or our stockholders through a stockholder vote 
any such transactions we may complete in the future or potential future strategic decisions we make may disappoint investors and depress the price of our common stock and the value of your investment in our common stock 
this may require us to raise more money  incur non recurring or other charges  and pose significant integration challenges and or management and business disruptions  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 
further we may not be able to successfully integrate a transaction in a suitable time frame or at all  or achieve any perceived synergies 
the successful completion of such a transaction or a combination of transactions may result in the stockholders not owning a majority of our shares and there may be a significant change in management and the board of directors 
if we succeed in implementing our strategy of pursuing other preclinical and clinical development opportunities through in licensing  acquisition or merger  we may encounter difficulties in managing our operations 
if we are successful in obtaining other preclinical or clinical product candidates or programs through in licensing  acquisition or merger  we may need to expand our research and clinical development  regulatory  manufacturing  accounting  information technology and marketing and sales capabilities through the addition of key employees or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain qualified employees  consultants or contractors that can support these additional needs 
we may obtain product candidates or programs that are based on chemical compounds  or small molecules 
historically  we have been focused on the development of antibody based product candidates  which are made from biologic materials and are generally considered to be large molecules  and therefore we have limited experience in development of small molecule candidates 
we cannot assure you that we can attract or retain qualified employees  consultants or third party contractors that have appropriate small molecule drug development experience 
in the event we cannot successfully manage the changes  if they occur there may be an adverse impact on our business 

table of contents if we are unable to retain  or  in the future  attract key employees  advisors or consultants  we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates or otherwise manage our business effectively 
our success depends in part on our ability to retain qualified management and personnel  directors  and academic scientists and clinicians as advisors or consultants 
we are currently dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and senior management 
in order to pursue our strategy of obtaining preclinical and clinical stage development opportunities through in licensing  acquisition or merger  we will need to retain our personnel with experience in a number of disciplines  including research and development  clinical testing  government regulation  manufacturing  sales and marketing  accounting  finance  human resources and information systems 
although we have not had material difficulties in retaining and attracting key personnel in the past  we may not be able to continue to retain and attract such personnel on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we lose any key employees  or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel or advisors  our business may be harmed 
if we are successful in obtaining preclinical or clinical stage product candidates or programs through in licensing  acquisition or merger activities  we may need additional cash  which may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
we expect that we may need additional capital in the future  and the extent of this need will depend on many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including our ability to obtain and successfully integrate preclinical or clinical stage product candidates or programs through in licensing  acquisition or merger activities  the successful and continued development of our mscramm product candidates in preclinical and clinical testing independently or through collaboration  the time it takes to receive regulatory approvals needed to market our product candidates  the establishment of marketing and sales capabilities independently or through a third party and the costs to develop a corporate infrastructure to support the commercialization of our product candidates  the level of market acceptance of our products  future payments  if any  received or made under existing or possible future collaborative arrangements  the costs associated with protecting and expanding our patent and other intellectual property rights  and the need to acquire licenses to new products or compounds in the future 
we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments will enable us to operate for a period of at least months from the date of this filing 
if we are successful in implementing our strategy and obtain preclinical or clinical stage product candidates or programs through in licensing  acquisition or merger  the number of months that our existing cash resources might allow us to operate may be significantly shortened 
we have no other committed sources of additional capital at this time 
we cannot assure you that funds will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available to us on terms that we find acceptable  or at all  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate research and development efforts or clinical trials on any or all of our product candidates 
we may also be forced to curtail or restructure our operations  obtain funds by entering into arrangements with collaborators or partners on unattractive terms  sell or relinquish rights to certain technologies  product candidates or our intellectual property that we would not otherwise sell or relinquish in order to continue our operations 
if we are successful in pursuing other preclinical and clinical anti infective development opportunities through in licensing  acquisition or merger  your ownership in us could be diluted 
we anticipate that we will need to issue additional shares of common stock in the future to support or fund our current strategy and our operations 
any issuance of additional equity we may undertake in the future could cause the price of our common stock to decline  or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower 
table of contents than that paid by holders of our common stock in the past  which would result in those shares being dilutive 
if we obtain funds through a credit facility or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities  these securities would likely have rights senior to your rights as a common stockholder 
no antibody based products that target mscramm proteins have been developed or approved 
all of our existing product candidates  including aurexis  target various mscramm proteins 
the use of mscramm proteins to develop antibody based products is an untested approach 
these proteins have yet to be used by us or others to successfully develop any approved drugs 
mscramm proteins may ultimately prove to be a non viable target for developing anti infective or other drug candidates 
we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize product candidates that are the subject of collaborations if our collaborators do not perform 
we expect to enter into and rely on collaborations or other arrangements with third parties to develop and or commercialize our existing and future product candidates 
such collaborators may not perform as agreed  or may fail to comply with strict regulations or elect to delay or terminate their efforts in developing or commercializing our product candidates 
we currently have collaborations with wyeth to develop a vaccine to prevent staphylococcal infections in humans  with m company to develop various diagnostic products using our mscramm platform  and with dyax corp 
to jointly develop a monoclonal antibody that targets mscramm proteins on enterococci 
we believe these collaborations are desirable for us to fund research and development activities  provide a suitable manufacturer  and to obtain regulatory approvals and to successfully commercialize any product candidates that result from these collaborations 
we cannot assure you that any product candidates will emerge from our relationships with wyeth  m company  or dyax or other collaborations we may enter into in the future related any of our other product candidates 
our revenues  expenses and results of operations will be subject to significant fluctuations  which will make it difficult to compare our operating results from period to period 
until we have successfully developed and commercialized an existing or future product candidate  we expect that substantially all of our revenues will result from payments we receive under collaborative arrangements or license agreements where we grant others the right to use our intellectual property 
we may not be able to generate additional revenues under existing or future collaborative agreements 
furthermore  payments potentially due to us under our existing and any future collaborative arrangements  including any milestone and up front payments  are subject to significant fluctuation in both timing and amount  or may never be earned or paid 
therefore  our historical and current revenues may not be indicative of our ability to achieve additional payment generating milestones 
in addition  certain of our contract agreements provide for minimum commitment obligation amounts that we may not need and therefore may not be cost effective to us 
as of december   our minimum future commitments  including debt and lease obligations amounted to an aggregate of million  assuming the relevant agreements are not cancelled or terminated by us 
we expect that our operating results will also vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result of the timing of in licensing  acquisition or merger  our research and development efforts  the execution or termination of collaborative arrangements  the initiation  success or failure of clinical trials  the timing of the manufacture of our product candidates  or other development related factors 
accordingly  our revenues and results of operations for any period may not be comparable to the revenues or results of operations for any other period 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  our business prospects could be harmed 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patents or rights to patents and maintain their validity  protect our trade secrets  
table of contents operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights or patents 
we will be able to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
the patent position of biopharmaceutical companies involves complex legal and factual questions  and  therefore  we cannot predict with certainty whether we will be able to ultimately enforce our patents or proprietary rights 
any patents that we own or have rights to may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and may not provide us with the protection against competitors that we anticipate 
accordingly  we may be forced to engage in costly and time consuming litigation in order to protect our intellectual property rights 
our pending patent applications  or those we may file or license from third parties in the future  may not result in patents being issued 
until a patent is issued  the claims covered by the patent may be narrowed or removed entirely and therefore we may not obtain adequate patent protection 
as a result  we may face unanticipated competition  or conclude that without patent rights the risk of bringing product candidates to the market is too great  thus adversely affecting our operating results 
because of the extensive time required for the development  testing and regulatory review of a product candidate  it is possible that before any of our product candidates can be approved for sale and commercialized  our relevant patent rights may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization 
patent expiration could adversely affect our ability to protect future product development and  consequently  our operating results and financial position 
also  patent rights may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technologies 
the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we seek to protect these  in part  through confidentiality and non disclosure agreements 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our technology or adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information 
failure to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know how could seriously impair our competitive position and harm our business 
we may become involved in costly litigation in order to enforce patent rights or protect trade secrets or know how that we own or license 
if a third party claims we are infringing on its intellectual property rights  we could incur significant litigation or licensing expenses  or be prevented from further developing or commercializing our products 
our success depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property claims  united states patent and trademark office interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states and internationally involve complex legal and factual questions 
as a result  such proceedings are lengthy  costly and time consuming and their outcome is uncertain 
we may become involved in litigation in order to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
patent applications in the united states are  in most cases  maintained in secrecy until the patent is issued 
the publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made 
therefore  patent applications relating to products similar to our product candidates may have already been filed by others without our knowledge 
in the event an infringement claim is brought against us  we may be required to pay substantial legal and other expenses to defend such a claim and  if we are unsuccessful in defending the claim  we may be prevented from pursuing related product development and commercialization and may be subject to damage awards 
if we become involved in any patent litigation  interference or other administrative proceedings  we will incur substantial expense  and the efforts of our technical and management personnel will be significantly diverted 
a detrimental outcome of such litigation or proceedings may expose us to loss of our proprietary position or to significant liabilities  or require us to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
we may be restricted or prevented from developing  manufacturing 
table of contents and selling our product candidates in the event of an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or if we fail to obtain necessary licenses 
our current and future product candidates may be covered by third party patents or other intellectual property rights  in which case we would need to obtain a license or sublicense to these rights in order to develop or commercialize them 
any required licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we do not obtain the required licenses or sublicenses  we could encounter delays in the development of our product candidates or be prevented from manufacturing and commercializing our products 
if it is determined that we have infringed an issued patent  we could be compelled to pay significant damages  including punitive damages 
in cases where we have in licensed intellectual property  our failure to comply with the terms and conditions of such agreements could harm our business 
our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological changes 
as a result  we may be unable to compete successfully or develop innovative products  which could harm our business 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change as researchers learn more about genetics and develop new technologies and approaches to treating and preventing disease 
our current and potential competitors generally include  among others  major multinational pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology firms  universities and other research institutions 
some of these companies and institutions  either alone or together with their collaborators  have substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development staffs than we do 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborators  have significantly greater experience than we do in discovering  developing  manufacturing and marketing products 
developments by others may render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from other companies for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions  for attracting investigators and sites capable of conducting our clinical trials and for licenses of proprietary technology 
these competitors  either alone or with their collaborators  may succeed in developing technologies or products that are more effective  less expensive or easier to administer than ours 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in obtaining fda or other regulatory approvals for their drug candidates more rapidly than we can 
companies that complete clinical trials  obtain required regulatory approvals and commercialize their drugs before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage  including certain patent and fda marketing exclusivity rights that could delay the ability of competitors to market certain products 
we cannot assure you that product candidates resulting from our research and development efforts  or from joint efforts with our collaborators  will be able to compete successfully with our competitors existing products or products under development 
if a product liability claim is successfully brought against us for uninsured liabilities or such claim exceeds our insurance coverage  we could be forced to pay substantial damage awards 
the use of any of our existing or future product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any approved products may expose us to product liability claims 
we currently have product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials in the amount of million 
in the event any of our product candidates are approved for sale by the fda  we anticipate that we may need to increase our product liability coverage 
such insurance coverage may not protect us against any or all of the product liability claims that may be brought against us in the future 
we may not be able to acquire or maintain adequate insurance coverage at a commercially reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against potential losses 
in the event a product liability claim is brought against us  we may be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim  as well as uncovered damage awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us 
defending any product liability claim or claims could require us to expend significant financial and managerial resources  which could have an adverse effect on our business 

table of contents if our use of hazardous materials results in contamination or injury  we could suffer significant financial loss 
our research and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials and medical waste 
notwithstanding the regulations controlling the use of these materials and the safety procedures we undertake  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of an accident or environmental discharge or exposure  we may be held liable for any resulting damages  which may exceed our financial resources 
if the clinical trials for our product candidates  including those that are subject to collaboration agreements are unsuccessful or delayed  we could be delayed or precluded from further developing or ultimately selling our product candidates  or collaborated product candidates 
you must evaluate us in light of the uncertainties  complexities and risks present in a development stage biopharmaceutical company 
in order to receive regulatory approval to sell our product candidates  we must conduct extensive pre clinical and clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the fda or other regulatory authorities 
pre clinical and clinical testing is expensive  takes many years to complete  and its outcome is highly uncertain 
delays  or clinical setbacks or failures may occur at any time  or in any phase of the pre clinical or clinical development process for a number of reasons  including safety concerns  a lack of demonstrated efficacy  poor trial design  and manufacturing related issues related to the material used to conduct the clinical trials 
if the enrollment of patients into our clinical trials is delayed or proceeds at a slower pace than expected  our clinical trials will take longer  and cost more  to complete 
the results of preclinical studies and prior clinical trials of our product candidates are not necessarily predictive of the results of later stage clinical trials 
in many cases  product candidates in later stages of clinical development may fail to show desired safety and efficacy traits despite having successfully demonstrated so in earlier clinical testing 
even if the data collected from clinical trials involving our product candidates are satisfactory and demonstrate safety and efficacy  such results may not be sufficient to support the submission of a bla or nda or to obtain regulatory approval from the fda in the united states  or elsewhere 
we have completed a patient phase ii trial for aurexis 
the results of the phase ii trials were not statistically significant 
there can be no assurance that the results of this trial are predictive of the outcome of later stage trials for aurexis 
even if our products are granted regulatory approval  post approval or phase iv clinical trials may demonstrate safety concerns that require removing the product from the marketplace 
we must comply with extensive government regulations in order to obtain and maintain marketing approval for our products in the united states and abroad 
our product candidates and any products for which we receive fda approval to sell are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic and foreign government regulation 
the fda regulates  among other things  the development  testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  record keeping  labeling  storage  approval  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
our product candidates are also subject to similar extensive regulation by foreign governments to the extent we seek to develop and commercialize them in those countries 
we must provide the fda and foreign regulatory authorities  if applicable  with clinical data that appropriately demonstrate our product candidates safety and efficacy in humans before they can be approved for the targeted indications 
none of our product candidates has been approved for sale in the united states or any foreign market  and we cannot predict whether regulatory approval will be obtained for any product candidate we are developing or plan to develop 
the regulatory review and approval process can take many years  is dependent upon the type  complexity  novelty of  and need for the product  requires the expenditure of substantial resources  involves post marketing surveillance and vigilance  and generally involves ongoing requirements for post marketing studies or phase iv clinical trials 
in addition  we may encounter delays in or fail to gain regulatory approval for our product candidates based upon additional governmental regulation resulting from future legislative or administrative action or changes in fda policy or interpretation during the period of product development 
delays or failures in obtaining regulatory approvals may adversely affect our ability to further develop or commercialize any product candidates  
table of contents diminish any competitive advantages that we may have or attain  and adversely affect revenues or the receipt of royalties from the sale of our products 
furthermore  any regulatory approvals  if granted  may later be withdrawn 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any time  or if post approval safety concerns arise  we may be subject to restrictions or a number of actions  including delays in clinical trials or the commercialization of our products  refusal by the fda to review pending applications or supplements to approved applications  product recalls or seizures  suspension of manufacturing  withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications  and fines  civil penalties and criminal prosecutions 
additionally  we may voluntarily withdraw any approved product from the market if we believe that the product may pose a safety risk to patients  or if the approved product no longer meets our business objectives 
the ability to market a pharmaceutical product outside of the united states is contingent upon receiving marketing authorization from the respective foreign regulatory authorities 
foreign regulatory approval processes typically include many  if not all  of the risks associated with the fda as described above and may include additional risks 
if third party vendors upon whom we rely to conduct our pre clinical studies and clinical trials do not perform or fail to comply with strict regulations  the clinical trials for our product candidates may be terminated  delayed  or unsuccessful 
we have limited experience in conducting and managing large clinical trials 
we have historically relied and intend to continue to rely on third parties  including clinical research organizations  consultants and principal investigators to assist us in managing  monitoring and conducting our pre clinical studies and clinical trials 
we rely on these vendors and individuals to assist in performing many facets of the development process  including toxicological studies  the recruitment of sites and patients for participation in our clinical trials  to maintain positive relations with the clinical sites and to ensure that these sites are conducting our trials in compliance with the protocol  our instructions and applicable regulations 
if these third parties fail to perform satisfactorily or do not adequately fulfill their obligations under the terms of our agreements with them  we may not be able to enter into alternative arrangements without undue delay or additional expenditures  and therefore the clinical trials for our product candidates may be delayed or unsuccessful 
further  the fda may inspect some of the clinical sites participating in our clinical trials  or our third party vendors sites  to determine if our clinical trials are being conducted according to current good clinical practices 
if we or the fda determine that our third party vendors are not in compliance with  or have not conducted our clinical trials according to applicable regulations  we may be forced to delay  repeat or terminate such clinical trials 
any delay  repetition or termination of our clinical trials could be very costly and materially harm our business 
if third party contract manufacturers  upon whom we rely to manufacture our product candidates do not perform  fail to manufacture according to our specifications or fail to comply with strict regulations  our clinical trials and the commercialization of our products could be terminated  delayed  or adversely affected 
we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities 
we have historically contracted with third party manufacturers to make clinical trial materials for our product candidates in development  and we intend to continue to rely on third party contract manufacturers  at least for the foreseeable future  to manufacture our product candidates 
our reliance on third party contract manufacturers exposes us to a number of risks  any of which could delay or prevent the completion of pre clinical studies or clinical trials  the regulatory approval or 
table of contents commercialization of our product candidates  result in higher costs  or deprive us of potential product revenues 
some of these risks include the number of potential contract manufacturers that are able to produce our product candidates may be limited 
our third party contract manufacturers may place a priority on the manufacture of their own products  or other customers products 
our contract manufacturers may fail to perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business 
the manufacture of products requires compliance with numerous and strict safety  quality and regulatory standards 
our contract manufacturers may not produce our product candidates according to their own standards  our specifications  cgmp requirements  or may otherwise manufacture material that we or the fda may deem to be unusable in our clinical trials or commercially 
our manufacturers plants may be closed as a result of regulatory sanctions or a natural disaster 
our contract manufactures may be unable to increase the scale of  or increase the capacity for  our product candidates  we may experience a shortage in supply  or the cost to manufacture our products may increase to the point where it adversely affects the profitability of our products 
further  regulatory approval or the commercialization of our products may be delayed 
we cannot assure you that our contract manufactures will be able to manufacture our products at a suitable scale  or we will be able to find alternative manufacturers acceptable to us who can do so 
drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic inspections by the fda  the united states drug enforcement administration  or dea  and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with cgmps  other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
while we are obligated to audit their performance  we do not have control over our third party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
failure by our third party manufacturers  or us  to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us or the drug manufacturer from the production of other third party products 
these sanctions include fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of the government to grant pre market approval of drugs  delays  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  seizures or recalls of product  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business 
in the event that we need to change our third party contract manufacturers  our clinical trials and the commercialization of our products could be delayed  adversely affected or terminated  result in higher costs  or deprive us of potential product revenues 
due to regulatory restrictions inherent in a bla or nda  the manufacture of our product candidates  may be sole sourced 
in accordance with fda mandated current good manufacturing practices  or cgmps  changing manufacturers may require the re validation of the manufacturing processes and procedures and may require further clinical trials 
changing our current or future contract manufacturers may be difficult for us and could be costly and take several years to complete  which could result in our inability to manufacture our products or product candidates for an extended period of time 
it may be difficult or impossible for us to find alternative manufacturers on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if we fail to establish marketing and sales capabilities or fail to enter into effective sales  marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties  we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products 
we anticipate that we will establish relationships with other companies to commercialize some or all of our products in north america and in other countries around the world 
we currently have no infrastructure to support such activities  and have little  if any  experience in the commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
therefore  our future profitability will depend in part on our ability to access or develop a capable sales force 
table of contents and suitable marketing capabilities in a timely manner 
the development of a sales force and marketing capabilities may result in us incurring significant costs before the time that we may generate significant revenues 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified third parties or marketing or sales personnel  or be able to establish an effective sales force 
to the extent that we enter into marketing and sales arrangements with other companies to sell  promote or market our products in the united states or abroad  our product revenues  which may be in the form of direct revenue  a royalty  or a spilt of profits  will depend on their efforts  which may not be successful 
if government and third party payers fail to provide adequate reimbursement or coverage for our products or those we develop through collaborations  our revenues and potential for profitability will be harmed 
in the united states and most foreign markets  our product revenues will depend principally upon the reimbursement rates established by third party payers for our products 
such third party payers include government health administration authorities  managed care providers  private health insurers and other organizations 
these third party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
in addition  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status  if any  of newly approved drugs or pharmaceutical products 
we may need to conduct post marketing clinical trials in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our products 
such studies may require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources 
we cannot assure you that our products will be reimbursed in part  or at all  by any third party payers 
domestic and foreign governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare  including pharmaceutical drugs 
in some foreign markets  governments control prescription drugs pricing and profitability 
in the united states  we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental control 
in addition  increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states will continue to put downward pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any of our products in the future  which would limit our revenues and profitability 
accordingly  legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceutical products may change before our product candidates are approved for sale  which could further limit or eliminate reimbursement rates for our products 
biologic based products  such as aurexis and other mscramm based product candidates  tend to be relatively expensive as compared to other pharmaceutical products 
as such  these products may be more susceptible to the pressures associated with pricing challenges from and reimbursement status with third party payers 
if our products or those we develop through product collaborations are approved  but do not gain meaningful acceptance in their intended markets  we are not likely to generate significant revenues or become profitable 
even if our product candidates are successfully developed and we obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to sell our products in the future  they may not gain market acceptance or utilization among physicians and patients  or reimbursement or coverage from third party payers 
the degree of market acceptance for any product that we commercialize will depend on a number of factors  including the therapeutic efficacy or perceived benefit of the product  the level of reimbursement available to cover the cost of the product  the cost of the product to the user or payer  the product s potential advantages over existing or alternative therapies  the actual or perceived safety of similar classes of products  
table of contents the effectiveness of sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  and the scope of the product label approved by the fda 
there can be no assurance that physicians will choose to administer our products to the intended patient population 
if our products do not achieve meaningful market acceptance  or if the market for our products proves to be smaller than anticipated  we may not generate significant revenues or ever become profitable 
we have experienced losses since our inception 
we expect to continue to incur such losses for the foreseeable future and we may never become profitable 
since inception may  through december   we have incurred a cumulative deficit of approximately million 
our losses to date have resulted principally from costs related to our research programs and the clinical development of our product candidates  and general and administrative costs relating to our operations 
we anticipate incurring losses for the foreseeable future if we further develop our product candidates or acquire additional product candidates or programs  which will generally require us to conduct significant research and laboratory testing  conduct extensive and expensive clinical trials  and seek regulatory approvals 
we cannot assure you that we will ever generate direct or royalty revenue from the sale of products or ever become profitable 
based on our current strategy our quarterly and annual operating costs and revenues may become highly volatile  and comparisons to previous periods will be difficult to compare 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  our amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent a change in our control or our management 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws and the laws of delaware  the state in which we are incorporated may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of us or a change in management that stockholders may consider favorable 
these provisions establish a classified  or staggered  board of directors  so that not all members of our board may be elected at one time  set limitations on the removal of directors  limit who may call a special meeting of stockholders  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  and provide our board of directors the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to remove and elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

the following discussion contains assumptions  estimates and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under risk factors  special note on forward looking statements and elsewhere in this form k 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company that has historically been focused on the discovery and development of novel antibody based products for the prevention and treatment of serious bacterial and fungal infections 
in november  we completed enrollment in a  patient pivotal phase iii clinical trial of veronate  a product candidate that we had been developing for the prevention of certain hospital associated infections in premature  very low birth weight infants 
on april   we announced that this pivotal phase iii trial did not achieve its primary endpoint or any of its secondary endpoints 
our second product candidate in clinical development is aurexis  for which we completed a patient phase ii clinical trial in may evaluating it as first line therapy  in combination with antibiotics  to treat serious  life threatening s 
aureus  bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients 
we also have several ongoing preclinical stage development programs 
in light of the pivotal phase iii results for veronate in april  we have discontinued the development of veronate  reduced our work force  and realigned our operations consistent with the development status of our other mscramm based development programs 
in addition after a comprehensive review of the our entire pipeline  assets  resources and capabilities  we adopted a strategy to preserve a significant portion of our financial resources to pursue other pre clinical or clinical stage product candidates or programs beyond our mscramm platform via in licensing  acquisition or merger 
we have not yet completed such a transaction 
while we are in various stages of discussions associated with these efforts  we cannot determine when  if ever  we will be successful in implementing this strategy 
pending the outcome of these strategically focused activities  we plan to continue to leverage our capabilities and intellectual property related to our mscramm protein platform through future corporate collaborations that can provide financial and other synergistic capabilities to support the further development of these programs and maximize their potential 
based on our strategy our quarterly and annual operating costs and revenues may become highly volatile in the future  and comparisons to previous periods will be difficult to compare 
all of our existing clinical and preclinical development programs are based on our mscramm platform  for which we own or have licensed numerous patents and patent applications 
we have retained all worldwide rights to aurexis  and other mscramm product candidates 
we have never received regulatory approval for any past or existing product candidates 
we currently have little  if any  commercialization capabilities  and it is possible that we may never successfully derive any commercial revenues from any of our product candidates  or programs  either directly or through royalties 
we are a development stage company that has generated significant losses since our inception in may to date  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts towards research and development activities related to our product candidates  product candidates that are the subject of collaborations  and preclinical programs 
we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we plan to continue the development of our mscramm based research and development activities independently or through collaborations  and intend to support the clinical development of any preclinical or clinical anti infective drug development programs that we may obtain through our in licensing  acquisition or merger activities 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 

table of contents financial operations overview revenue 
since our inception  we have not generated any substantial revenue from the sale of products and do not expect product related revenues until we obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize a product candidate independently or through collaboration 
our revenues have historically represented the amortization of an up front license fee and quarterly research and development support payments we have received in connection with a license and collaboration agreement with wyeth  and from time to time  grant revenue and proceeds from research activities we performed under a materials transfer agreement not covered by a license or collaboration agreement 
in january we executed a license and commercialization agreement with m for the development of various diagnostic products using our mscramm platform 
we may generate future revenues from up front license fees or milestone payments in connection with collaborators  or other strategic relationships and royalties resulting from the licensing of our intellectual property 
if our or any of our collaborators future development efforts result in regulatory approval and the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates or collaborated product candidates  we expect the majority of our future revenues would then result from product sales or royalties 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of the expenses incurred in discovering  developing  testing and manufacturing of product candidates 
these costs consist primarily of professional fees paid to third party service providers in conjunction with treating patients enrolled in our clinical trials and monitoring  accumulating and evaluating the related data  salaries and personnel related expenses  including share based compensation  the cost of raw materials  contract manufacturing services  supplies used in clinical trials and research and development activities  legal patent services  consulting  depreciation  license and sponsored research fees paid to third parties  and facilities costs 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and direct external costs represent expenses paid to third parties that specifically relate to product candidates in pre clinical or clinical development  such as payments to third parties that perform development services  such as toxicological tests  contract research organizations that monitor  accumulate and analyze data from our clinical trials  investigators who treat the patients enrolled in our clinical trials  and the cost of manufacturing clinical trial material including raw materials 
all remaining research and development expenses  such as salaries and personnel related expenses  supplies  depreciation  legal patent services  consulting  general licenses and sponsored research  facility costs and other overhead costs  are not tracked to a specific product development program and are included in unallocated costs and overhead 
research and development spending for past periods is not indicative of spending in future periods 
years ended december  in thousands direct external costs veronate aurexis unallocated costs and overhead total research and development expenses we anticipate that our research and development costs will decrease substantially in the first two quarters of as compared to our annualized expense in due to the completion of the phase iii veronate trial and the reduction of the personnel in our research and development organization 
due to the uncertainty regarding the status and timing of ongoing or future discussions related to in licensing  acquisition and merger activities  future clinical trials  and licensing or collaborations  our future expenditures are likely to be highly volatile in future periods depending on the outcomes 
from time to time  we will make determinations as to how much funding to direct to these programs in response to their scientific  clinical and regulatory success  and anticipated market opportunity 
from inception through december   we have incurred approximately million in research and development expenses 

table of contents the successful development of our existing or future product candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate the nature  timing and cost of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from any of our existing or future product candidates due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with their development  including the uncertainty of the status and timing of potential in licensing  acquisition and merger activities and possible outcomes of these activities  the scope  rate of progress and cost associated with our pre clinical activities and research and development programs  the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials  future clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may enter into  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost of manufacturing clinical trial materials for our product candidates  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the cost of establishing  maintaining  and protecting our patents and intellectual property portfolio  and the availability of funding to continue research and development activities 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with implementing our strategy or completing the development of our existing or future product candidates  if at all  and some of the possible consequences of failing to do so  is set forth in the risk factors section of this form k 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related expenses  including share based compensation for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  information technology  sales and marketing  business development and human resources functions 
other significant costs include professional fees for legal and accounting services  market research and other consulting services  as well as premiums for insurance  including directors and officers insurance incurred as a result of being publicly traded  public company expenses  and depreciation and facility expenses 
pending the outcome of our in licensing  acquisition and merger activities  we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease for the first two quarters of as compared to our annualized expense in due to the downsizing of personnel in general and administrative function 
due to the uncertainty regarding the status and timing of ongoing discussions related to in licensing  acquisition and merger activities  future expenditures are likely to be highly volatile depending on the outcome 
from inception through december   we have incurred approximately million in general and administrative expenses 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on capital leases and notes payable 
other income and expense has historically consisted of the proceeds from the sale of excess raw materials  the gain or loss on the disposal of equipment  and the reversal of a liability for which the obligation to provide further services or settlement is not required 
dividends and accretion to redemption value of redeemable preferred stock 
until the completion of our initial public offering  or ipo  in june  when all then outstanding preferred stock and related dividends were converted into common stock  we accrued for an cumulative annual dividend payable on our series c redeemable convertible preferred stock  and on our series d redeemable convertible preferred stock 
in addition  since our redeemable preferred stock had been discounted to reflect the value of attached warrants  we accreted  or increased  the book value of our redeemable preferred stock to equal its redemption value by the earliest redemption date 
this accretion had the impact of reducing stockholders equity and increasing the net loss per share attributable to common stockholders 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our current financial condition and historical results of operations are based on our audited financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the selection and application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable at the time  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities 
actual future results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

actual future results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue under licensing and other collaborative research and development agreements as we perform services or meet contractual obligations 
accordingly  up front  non refundable license fees under agreements in which we have an ongoing research and development commitment are amortized  on a straight line basis  over the term of our ongoing obligations under the agreement 
revenues received for ongoing research and development activities under collaborative arrangements are recognized as the research and development activities are performed pursuant to the terms of the related agreements 
in the event we receive milestone payments in the future  we will recognize such payments when all of the terms of such milestone are achieved 
accrued expenses 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to estimate expenses that we believe have been incurred  but for which we have not yet received invoices from our vendors 
this process involves identifying services and activities that have been performed by third party vendors on our behalf and estimating the level to which they have been performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date 
examples of significant expenses for which we generally accrue based on estimates include fees for services  such as those provided by certain clinical research and data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials and fees owed to certain contract manufacturers in conjunction with the manufacture of materials for our clinical trials 
in order to estimate costs incurred to date  but have not yet have been invoiced  we analyze the progress and related activities  invoices received and budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability for these related costs 
we make these estimates based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe that historically our accruals have been reasonably accurate

under fin  the financial statements will reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts  but without considering time values 
fin substantially changes the applicable accounting model and is likely to cause greater volatility in income statements as more items are recognized discretely within income tax expense 
fin also revises disclosure requirements and introduces a prescriptive  annual tabular rollforward of the unrecognized tax benefits 
fin is effective for us beginning january  we are evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our financial position and results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not believe that its adoption in the first quarter of will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements

table of contents general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased to million in from million in the increase of million  or  was primarily due to an increase in professional and legal fees in of million incurred as a result of the company becoming publicly traded in june  an increase of million in salaries  benefits  and share based compensation  a million increase in marketing research expenses  an increase of million in depreciation and facility related expenses  and a million increase in other expenses 
the additional expenses of becoming a publicly traded company included a significant increase in directors and officers insurance premiums  expenditures related to recruiting expenses and compensating members of our board of directors  consulting fees associated with implementing the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  higher audit and legal fees  and consulting and professional fees related to investor and public relations 
salaries  benefits  and share based compensation expenses increased in due to the hiring of additional personnel to support our public company infrastructure  planned commercialization of veronate  and higher salaries as compared to market research expenses increased in due to expenditures related to the planning and commercialization of veronate as compared to depreciation and facility related expenses increased in due to higher rent and operating expenses related to our new facility as compared to interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  increased to million for from million in the increase of million was principally the result of a million increase in interest income due to significantly higher average cash balances and higher interest rates in  offset in part by a loss on disposal of assets in the third quarter of and a gain on the sale of plasma that occurred in dividends and accretion to redemption value of redeemable preferred stock 
dividends on preferred stock and accretion to redemption value of redeemable preferred stock decreased to zero in from million in as of june   the closing date of our initial public offering  all the related redeemable preferred stock was converted to common stock  and therefore  we did not record any dividends or accretion to redemption value after that date 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity since our inception in may through december   we have funded our operations primarily with million in gross proceeds raised from a series of five private equity financings  our ipo in june  and two pipe financings  or private placement of public equity financings 
from inception through december   we have also borrowed a total of million under various notes payable  a credit facility with a commercial bank and capital leases  and have received approximately million in license fees  collaborative research payments and grants  of which million and million were recorded as deferred revenue as of december  and december   respectively 
at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million and we held no investments with a maturity greater than months 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are generally held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  consisting of united states government agency securities  high grade corporate bonds  municipal bonds  asset backed securities  commercial paper  certificates of deposit  and money market accounts that have a maturity date of less than months 
cash flows for the year ended december   cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments decreased by million  from million to million 
this decrease resulted primarily from cash used for operating activities  capital expenditures  restructuring charges  and the repayment of capital lease obligations and notes payable  slightly offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  primarily reflecting a net loss of million  and was offset by non cash charges of million and a net decrease in assets over liabilities of million 
our net loss was largely the result of funding our clinical trials associated with veronate and aurexis  research 
table of contents and development activities  general and administrative expenses  expenses associated with the planning for the commercialization of veronate  and a number of restructuring charges primarily due to the unfavorable results from the veronate phase iii trial 
the net decrease in assets reflected a net decrease in prepaid expenses and receivables of million associated with lower prepaid insurance premiums  offset by higher trade receivables 
in addition there was a net decrease in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  and deferred revenue of million  which was primary the result of a decrease in accounts payable and deferred revenue  offset by an increase in accrued expenses associated largely with manufacturing related expenses  severance and termination obligations  and professional and legal fees associated with merger and acquisition activities 
we received approximately million of cash from investing activities during  which consisted of net sales of short term investments of million  offset by million for the purchases of laboratory and computer equipment 
we used net cash of million from financing activities during  which consisted of million in payments on our capital leases and promissory notes  offset slightly by million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock as result of the exercise of stock options 
funding requirements our future funding requirements are difficult to determine and will depend on a number of factors  including whether or not we are successful in obtaining additional pre clinical or clinical stage product candidates or program through in licensing  acquisition or merger activities  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the scope  rate of progress and cost of our pre clinical activities and research and development programs of our existing or future product candidates or programs  the cost of manufacturing clinical trial materials for our product candidates  the timing and costs involved in conducting pre clinical test or clinical trials  the cost to obtain and timing of regulatory approvals  the number of product candidates we may advance into clinical development  future payments received or made under existing or future license or collaboration agreements  whether we establish a corporate infrastructure to support the commercialization of our products  whether or not to establish a corporate infrastructure to support the commercialization of our products  the cost of filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent and other intellectual property claims  and the future need to acquire additional licenses or acquire product candidates or programs 
based on our current operations  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million as of december  will enable us to operate for a period of at least months from the date of this filing 
this estimate assumes that we continue to operate as we are currently operating  and we do not obtain additional pre clinical or clinical stage product candidates or programs through in licensing  acquisition or merger activities or otherwise enter into any other significant transaction or change our strategy 
we cannot predict with any certainty what impact such an event would have on our liquidity 
we currently do not have any commitments for future funding  nor do we anticipate that we will generate revenue from the sale of any products for a number of years 
therefore  in order to meet our anticipated liquidity needs beyond months  or possibly sooner in the event we obtain additional pre clinical or clinical stage products or programs through in licensing  acquisition or merger activities or otherwise enter into transactions  or change our strategy  we may need to raise additional capital 
we would expect to do so primarily through the sale of additional common stock or other equity securities and to a lesser extent  licensing agreements  strategic collaborations or debt financing 
these funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  and our 
table of contents failure to raise such funds could have a material adverse impact on our business strategy  plans  financial condition and results of operations 
if adequate funds are not available to us in the future  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs  delay or curtail our clinical trials  or obtain funds through license agreements  collaborative or partner arrangements pursuant to which we will likely have to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise choose to develop or commercialize independently 
additional equity financings may be dilutive to holders of our common stock  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant payment obligations and restrictive covenants that restrict how we operate our business 
contractual obligations our material contractual obligations relate primarily to notes payable  capital leases  an operating lease on our headquarters and laboratory facility and certain minimum obligations we have under third party agreements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands short and long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases and equipment obligations purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations reflects our maximum purchase obligations 
if terminated  our expected purchase commitments under these agreements would be approximately million in total  million for the period of less than one year  million for the period years  million for the period four to five years  and million for the period of more than years from the date of this table 
the contractual obligations outlined in the table above do not include several potential future milestone obligations we may be liable for in the future or royalties due under a number of our licensing and collaborative agreements 
the aggregate amount of our milestone obligations is approximately million assuming the full and successful development of our product candidates 
our milestone obligations are primarily due upon either the submission of a bla  and or the marketing approval of aurexis 
at this time  due to the uncertainties associated with the clinical development of aurexis  we cannot determine when these events may occur  if at all 
further  the license and collaboration agreements to which these milestone obligations relate are cancelable by us without further financial obligations  upon not more than days written notice in the event we choose to terminate any of the license agreements for any reason 
in december  we entered into an agreement to lease for ten years a  square foot research and office facility to be built to our specifications 
we estimate that our expenses associated with our facility for minimum rent payments will approximate to million per year on average under this lease 
as part of the lease agreement  certain leasehold improvements were paid by the lessor and capitalized see note commitments and contingencies of the financial statements 
the leasehold improvement assets are being amortized over seven years and the liability is being amortized over life of lease  which is ten years for the liability 
the amortization is recorded as a discount to rent expense for the liability and as amortization expense to leasehold improvements for the asset 
the balances of the capitalized lessor paid leasehold improvements are classified in the balance sheet as leasehold improvements for the asset and other liabilities for the liability see note other liabilities of the financial statements 
in addition  we took possession  or control of  the physical use of the facility in january  at which time the work was initiated on the leasehold improvements 
the leasehold improvements were completed in may this four month gap 
table of contents constituted a rent holiday 
as such  we accrued rent for that time period 
this accrued rent is being amortized as a discount to rent over the remaining year life of the lease 
the balance of this rent accrual is classified in the balance sheet as other liabilities see note other liabilities of the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investment risk our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
the objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality investment grade debt instruments of financial institutions  corporations and united states government agency securities with a weighted average maturity of no longer than months 
due to the relatively short term nature of these investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure  and as a result  the estimated fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments approximates their principal amounts 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount  and have no plans to sell investments prior to their maturity 
we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments and we do not have significant interest rate risk associated with our debt obligations 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments 
limited suppliers we rely on certain raw materials and supplies used in the development process that are procured from a small group of suppliers and from time to time  on certain single sourced third party contract manufacturers that make our product candidates 
due to stringent manufacturing requirements for our third party fda approved suppliers  we may be unable to successfully mitigate the risk associated with our reliance on these few vendors 
the failure of a supplier or a single sources contract manufacturer to deliver on schedule  or at all  could delay or interrupt the development process and adversely affect our operating results 
effects of inflation the majority of our assets are monetary  consisting of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not generally directly affected by inflation 
we also believe that we have intangible assets in the value of our technology and product candidates 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we have not recorded the value of any intellectual property or intangible assets that we have developed on our balance sheet 
due to the nature of these intangible assets  we do not believe they are affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources
