acquisitions on january   we completed our acquisition of cyberguard corporation  a leading provider of network security solutions designed to protect enterprises that use the internet for electronic commerce and secure communication  in a stock and cash transaction valued at million 
this acquisition strengthens our position as one of the market leaders in network gateway security appliances  and strengthens our position in the web gateway security space 
cyberguard was a logical fit for us  enhancing our strategic vision and better positioning us in two rapidly growing segments of the security industry 
along with an expanded customer and partner base  this merger provided us with important competitive advantages in the network and web gateway security markets 
on august   we completed our acquisition of ciphertrust  inc  the global leader in the messaging security market  in a stock and cash transaction valued at million 
ciphertrust s products provide innovative layered security solutions to stop inbound messaging threats such as spam  viruses  intrusions and phishing  and protect against outbound policy and compliance violations associated with sensitive data leakage 
ciphertrust s products include ironmail  powered by trustedsource  ironim  secure computing edge  ironnet  and radar 
as a result of the acquisition we expect to establish ourselves as a leader in the messaging gateway security market 
in addition to protecting corporate network infrastructures  our combined solutions will address the fast growing web and messaging gateway security needs 
industry background the rapid adoption of the internet as a worldwide networking standard has accelerated the distribution and sharing of data and applications  enabling enterprises to adopt new electronic ways of doing business 
the developing reliance on worldwide connectivity has allowed companies to greatly expand their business opportunities 
activities such as electronic trading of goods and services  online delivery of digital content  electronic funds transfers and share trading are now achieved in unprecedented ways 
but with this growing opportunity comes new challenges for securing it systems 
the very features that give electronic business its power have elevated information security to a critical business issue 
today s enterprise is no longer confined to a set of physical buildings  rather  the enterprise has become virtual 
the internet s power of connectivity has erased physical barriers  allowing an organization to establish ties around the globe 
a business is no longer a single  isolated entity  it is part of a greater whole of interdependent entities whose lifeblood depends on the secure  electronic sharing of information 
organizations must now transcend the physical barriers of yesterday and expand their security measures outward to protect their digital resources beyond their physical buildings 
they must also migrate their security measures inward to each individual s computer or laptop 

table of contents conducting business over public networks as internet based infrastructure broadens  so do the risks associated with this exposure 
these risks increase daily and threaten confidentiality  integrity  and secure availability of intellectual property  proprietary data  and computing resources 
such threats present themselves in many forms  including the following malicious attacks are becoming more sophisticated and continuing to increase in volume 
according to international data corporation idc  a global provider of market research  malicious code  spyware and spam continue to be the most serious threats facing corporations today  but protecting sensitive data from leaving the organization is rapidly climbing the priority list of enterprise security threats 
hackers and attackers are no longer focused on hobby  but rather strict and prosperous financial gain  fraud and identity theft  which continue to be the leading drivers behind the increasing sophistication and volume of attacks 
web based malware programs sent on infected pages or through email downloaded from web based mailbox or via embedded images can attack automatically and in real time  making web security concerns a top priority for organizations seeking protection from the jump in spyware  trojans  worms  and other web traffic attacks 
risks from exposure to malicious software  worms  and viruses that can enter networks from many sources and cause damage  install spyware  or open secret backdoors into private computing resources 
theft by both infiltrators and employees of private citizen records and other proprietary information in violation of numerous federal regulations and statutes and state and local statutes  such as sarbanes oxley  the gramm leach bliley act  and the health insurance portability and accountability act 
intruders gaining unauthorized access to private computing resources and software applications 
legal liability exposure resulting from employee internet access  or from hijacked use of desktop personal computers and servers for unauthorized file storage and file sharing schemes 
identity theft and spoofing 
network and application server downtime due to denial of service dos and distributed denial of service attacks ddos 
confidentiality leaks via email  instant messaging chat sessions  person to person file sharing  and unauthorized attachments that leave private networks unfiltered 
productivity losses from spam clogged email inboxes 
application level vulnerabilities in today s highly complex internet environment  network attacks have evolved into application level attacks  and recently  an entirely new class of application specific threats have arisen that require far more stringent protection 
protecting the network is highly important  but by itself  is not sufficient 
the network is the foundation for communication  and the conduit over which people connect to the application resources they need and it is precisely these applications that can expose an organization s information resources to extreme vulnerability 
our products are designed to proactively address most  if not all  network security issues  whether its employees utilizing the internet  or remote partners and customers accessing the intranet  web services  and applications from outside the internal network 
our security measures extend beyond the network level  protecting applications and their resources so organizations can conduct their business  expand their reach  and drive success with confidence 
from email applications to web services  file transfer protocol ftp  customer relationship management crm and sales force automation systems  people connect across networks to applications in order to conduct business every day 
misuse of applications and web portals can result in the loss of valuable resources and 
table of contents millions of dollars 
as the applications we use have become more sophisticated  so have the attack capabilities that threaten them 
applications contain inherent vulnerabilities  and sophisticated attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities and undermine an organizations ability to conduct its business 
defensive measures must be even more sophisticated in their ability to protect against application level threats and our technology is designed with this in mind 
along with protecting against known threats  today s security solutions must be able to anticipate unknown threats before they enter the network 
a central part of an organization s business model must include provisions for safeguarding their business connections from being compromised to the highest degree possible 
market need and strategy more than ever before  organizations realize that they must take responsibility to protect their own confidential information and that of their customers and partners 
government regulations in recent years  such as the federal information security management act  the health insurance portability and accountability act  the gramm leach bliley act  and the children s internet protection act  have heightened awareness and mandated that organizations secure their information across multiple segments financial  medical  educational  and more 
enterprises must know that the data residing on a given network is secure and that parameters are in place for managing access to their proprietary information 
even as deadlines are met on these laws  enterprises must continue to refine their compliance solutions and move towards focusing on ongoing compliance 
in the coming years  larger enterprises which had to put in a quick fix to meet deadlines will be looking to implement longer term and more efficient solutions 
smaller businesses  which enjoyed some extended deadlines from congress  are still implementing their first time compliance solutions  representing a significant opportunity for security companies with a broad range of solutions 
our strategy is to provide organizations  both at the enterprise level as well as the small and medium business smb level  with a broad set of solutions when it comes to implementing their security objectives  beginning with knowledge about security risks and regulations  accompanied by industry leading security products to assist with mitigating these risks  and lastly  providing comprehensive security management capabilities 
our goal is to help organizations build confidence in the overall functionality and security of their network and application operations 
we accomplish this by providing scalable  manageable  highly available solutions that meet their needs today and in the future 
this objective includes meeting our customers requirements for security products that provide broad solutions by integrating with each other and interoperate within current infrastructures 
all of our products are designed to provide the strongest network protection available  along with central manageability  scalability  and interoperability 
providing solutions that are manageable  easy to use and that lead the industry in total cost of ownership for the customer are our top objectives for organizations of all sizes 
our solutions enable best business practices that keep the workplace secure  productive  and easily manageable 
our strategy also encompasses our award winning service and support organization 
we are able to provide our customers with unwavering service and support due  in part  to the knowledge base and technological expertise of our service and support staff 

table of contents secure computing solutions our specialized solutions are designed to meet customers needs to balance security and accessibility  and to help them create trusted environments both inside and outside their organizations 
each of our products provide a complete solution in and of itself  and they also integrate with each other for a more comprehensive  unified  and centrally managed solution 
we have developed a vision for comprehensive security on the enterprise gateway that embodies the following core design principles appliance based delivery 
all security functionality related to application intelligence and awareness needs to reside on a contained appliance 
these appliances must be built on a secure operating system platform  have a regulated set of interfaces to external systems  and be encased in strong  tamper proof hardware 
essentially  the appliance must mitigate the many security management problems of deploying software on a standard operating system server configuration 
application and content awareness 
today s security attacks have progressed far beyond the network and protocol level to that of the application and content 
the gateway needs a deep knowledge of the underlying communication  an understanding of the context of the communication  and the ability to inspect and interpret the content 
centralized policy  management and reporting 
the security gateway must have the ability to be centrally configured  provisioned and managed 
this  along with consolidated reporting  should provide immediate feedback on the effectiveness of the security appliance while helping reduce the cost of ownership 
bi directional protection 
the security gateway needs to effectively scrutinize inbound traffic in order to block bad traffic from entering the network  while simultaneously performing deep inspection of outbound content to protect against leaks of confidential information or intellectual property 
proactive protection 
with the rapid increase in polymorphic threats  the ability to know immediately what could be dangerous is imperative 
a gateway security system should be able to effectively thwart these attacks in real time 
user management and education 
the security gateway needs to protect all types of sensitive data automatically  with easy to manage policies  comprehensive audit trails  and employee feedback loops 
performance 
as traffic volumes increase exponentially  the gateways must be able to keep up and scale for performance without having to replace them  or take them off line for major upgrades 
resiliency 
security gateways should not introduce points of failure to the mission at hand 
our solutions for securing critical connections fall into four categories trustedsource global intelligence  enterprise gateway security appliances network  web  and messaging gateways  identity and access management  and security and support services 
trustedsource global intelligence we believe trustedsource technology is the most precise and comprehensive internet host reputation system in the world  which we are rolling into many of our product lines as a key cornerstone of global intelligence security 
trustedsource characterizes internet traffic and makes it understandable and actionable  and also creates a profile of all sender behavior on the internet and then utilizes this profile to watch for deviations from expected behavior for any given sender 
trustedsource then calculates a reputation score based on the behavior of the sending host 
we have an extensive network of thousands of sensors and other collection vehicles throughout the internet which tracks and reports back to trustedsource  data on all observed email traffic  giving trustedsource a real time view of internet communication worldwide 
originally developed to identify spammers  trustedsource is able to recognize any host profile anomalies and immediately calculate new reputation scores for senders and propagate this information to all trustedsource 
table of contents clients 
analyzing not only email senders but internet domains as well  this global intelligence technology is able to profile literally millions of entities connected to the internet worldwide in real time  and provide up to the minute host behavior analysis 
trustedsource is the first and only reputation system to combine traffic data  whitelists  blacklists and network characteristics with the unparalleled strength of our global network 
we believe the result is the most complete reputation system in the industry with the ability to score every ip address across the internet 
enterprise gateway security appliances network gateway security our enterprise gateway security platforms are the aggregation points not only for application specific defense in depth technologies based on deep knowledge of the underlying protocols and application environment  but also a mechanism for introducing real time intelligence to security relevant decisions about the disposition of application specific traffic 
this incorporates host and domain intelligence as well as bi directional security services in the areas of compliance  policy  encryption  email  web  and anti malware protection 
these services leverage centralized policy and management and are fully integrated with trustedsource and safeword identity and access management technology 
the idea of the network perimeter has evolved significantly since the advent of the web 
a mobile workforce  extranets  distributed applications and an environment of highly sophisticated  blended threats has forced enterprises to deploy an array of separate security applications to provide services such as firewall  virtual private network vpn  intrusion detection system ids intrusion prevention system ips  anti virus  anti spam  and more 
the recent movement toward all in one appliances has helped mitigate the problem to an extent  especially for small and mid size companies  but three major issues still remain many solutions rely on known malware signatures and fail to offer protection against previously unknown attacks the internet is a dynamic environment  with a security profile that changes in real time  and enterprise security applications often fail to adequately share policy and application intelligence between one another 
our network gateway security products address each of these areas of concern  providing the industry s strongest application firewall protections 
sidewinder g security appliance our security appliances consolidate all major internet security functions into a single system 
sidewinder g defends the network against all types of threats  both known and unknown 
through its unified threat management utm approach  sidewinder delivers best of breed anti spyware  anti virus  anti spam and anti fraud engines  web content filtering  trustedsource ip reputation services  secure domain name system dns  vpn  and secure sockets layer ssl gateways  and more 
in  we continued to differentiate our utm appliance from the competition with demonstrable zero hour attack protections on high profile internet attacks such as the sendmail vulnerability in march and microsoft windows metafile wmf attack in january 
we also announced plans to merge our newly acquired cyberguard firewall vpn technologies tsp and classic with our sidewinder g security appliance in our next generation utm appliance that has come to market in the first quarter of the cyberguard acquisition also brought to us a new paradigm in enterprise central management with the command center which we will continue to leverage going forward 
we believe command center s ability to do administration  configuration  monitoring  and management of software updates for a global appliance deployment coupled with our security reporter product s central reporting  and full out of the box compliance reports  continue to ensure that both medium and large customers see our network gateway appliances as the product of choice 
sidewinder g continues its proven security track record  in great part due to our secureos operating system with our patented type enforcement technology and flexible application level protection mechanisms

web gateway security web gateway security appliances protect enterprises from malware  data leakage  and internet misuse  while helping to ensure policy enforcement  regulatory compliance  and a productive application environment 
these platforms analyze traffic bi directionally 
inbound  they isolate and eliminate threats from all types of malware  including zero day threats  viruses  trojans  spam  phishing  and the like 
they use a deep knowledge of the underlying protocols and application behavior combined with global intelligence to make security decisions 
on the outbound side  in addition to preventing virus propagation and unwanted web site access  our enterprise web gateway security helps customers achieve regulatory compliance and prevent data leakage across both web and messaging applications

smartfilter continues to be the de facto filtering standard for original equipment manufacturers oem 
smartfilter is integrated on market leading solutions from vendors such as mcafee and computer associates 
messaging gateway security messaging has undergone a fundamental change in enterprise environments 
not too long ago  most electronic messaging was confined to applications like microsoft outlook and lotus notes 
now with the advent of web based mail applications like hotmail and gmail  as well as instant messaging  there are many more channels both into and out of the enterprise network 
in fact  messaging is now the preferred attack vector for hackers  and spam is their weapon of choice 
hackers now employ sophisticated networks of thousands of zombie computers or botnets to send messages infected with malware  putting the enterprise at a significant disadvantage 
even more discouraging is the sharp rise in zero day attacks  where there is no known signature that can be used to block the attack 

table of contents furthermore  messaging now represents a bi directional challenge 
not only are inbound threats becoming much more sophisticated and targeted  but outbound data leakage and regulatory compliance have become huge and well publicized liabilities for enterprises 
users can easily attach confidential documents to emails and instant message im conversations  making it trivial for sensitive information to find its way outside the network 
outbound content checking is not common practice 
and even in instances where such controls are in place  where the enterprise user is communicating over an ssl encrypted link ie  https  there is typically no mechanism in place to decrypt and inspect the traffic to ensure that policies are being enforced 
recognizing that messaging is now a primary business application in most enterprises  we have implemented a strategy to comprehensively address both inbound and outbound threats and to help our customers insure compliance with federally mandated requirements for the protection of sensitive data 
our messaging gateway security platforms look at traffic bi directionally 
inbound  they proactively isolate and eliminate threats from all types of malware zero day threats  viruses  trojans  spam  phishing  and the like 
we use a deep knowledge of the underlying protocols and application behavior combined with real time global intelligence to add a new dimension to security related processing 
on the outbound side  through sophisticated fingerprinting and data profiling techniques  our messaging gateways are able to determine which data either in the form of text in a message or text within an attachment need to be blocked or flagged due to security or compliance concerns 
our messaging gateways can also enforce mandatory outbound encryption for certain traffic types without requiring the installation of client software on the recipient s system 
we also prevent virus propagation throughout the messaging infrastructure  delivering maximum availability and security  effectiveness and global enterprise manageability across multiple messaging protocols including email  instant messaging and webmail 
this combination of easy to manage gateway appliances and sophisticated  centralized real time network intelligence provides clean  efficient communications  eliminating both inbound and outbound risks 
ironmail ironmail provides a centrally managed  integrated  best of breed messaging gateway security appliance for enterprises of all types and sizes 
in one integrated appliance  ironmail protects enterprise email systems from inbound spam  viruses  phishing  and hackers as well as from outbound threats regulatory or corporate policy compliance violations or theft leakage of confidential information or intellectual property 
we have integrated trustedsource ip reputation identities into our ironmail messaging gateway security appliances to provide real time behavior analysis on more than one third of the world s enterprise messaging traffic with over  sensors located in countries 
ironim the ironim instant messaging security appliance is the first and only solution that integrates policy to secure  log  monitor  and encrypt enterprise im communications

ironim supports multiple instant messaging networks including aol instant messenger  msn messenger  yahoo messenger  and corporate im solutions including microsoft lcs and ibm sametime and does not require deployment of a new im client 
radar radar protects an organization s online reputation  whether by detecting and stopping phishing scams or identifying and fixing pcs 
radar receives a real time stream of behavior based intelligence from our trustedsource global threat correlation engine to detect deviations from expected behavior for all senders and provides real time alerting to customers 
secure computing edge secure computing edge is a hardened appliance positioned at the perimeter of the mail system  applying trustedsource technology to control email traffic at the network border rather than at the mail server or desktop 
edge relies on trustedsource for information about every sender  to allow or reject email before it even reaches critical mail servers 

table of contents identity and access management one important development in enterprise security has been recognition of the need for strong authentication as a prerequisite for access to corporate network resources either remotely or from inside the network 
strong authentication has now been coupled with a fully functional access gateway and the ability to coordinate policies governing the extent and scope of corporate resource access by individuals 
this combination of strong authentication  centralized policy management and the ability to report at a very granular level on security relevant activity is commonly referred to as identity and access management iam  and is fundamental to any corporate security strategy 
we expanded our safeword product line in  thereby providing a comprehensive identity and access management portfolio that is fully integrated into our enterprise gateway security strategy and provides strong authentication and centralized policy and reporting across the entire enterprise gateway security portfolio 
remote access to network resources is a requirement for many businesses  but verifying the identity of your remote users with strong authentication and a reliable identity management system is vital for security 
additionally  organizations are increasingly realizing the many vulnerabilities of passwords  and they require strong authentication systems that are easy to install and deploy  simple to manage  and able to grow with their needs 
our safeword products meet these needs

seasonality as is typical for many large software companies  a part of our business is seasonal 
a slight decline in product orders is typical in the first quarter of our fiscal year when compared to product orders in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
in addition  we generally receive a higher volume of orders in the last month of a quarter 
we believe this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns and budget cycles 
backlog our backlog for products at any point in time is not significant since products are shipped upon receipt of order 
we do not believe that our backlog at any particular point in time is indicative of future sales levels 
the timing and volume of customer orders are difficult to forecast because our customers typically require prompt delivery of products and a majority of our sales are booked and shipped in the same quarter 
in addition  sales are generally made pursuant to standard purchase orders that can be rescheduled  reduced  or canceled prior to shipment with little or no penalty 
manufacturing our manufacturing operations consist primarily of light manufacturing of our software and appliance products 
we use subcontractors to duplicate software media and print user documentation and product packaging for our software products 
we have two different processes for manufacturing our appliances depending on the product line 
we either procure computer servers from major computer manufacturers and then assemble the final software and hardware products at our facilities in st 
paul  minnesota or we outsource all services to third party providers 
the third party providers complete the hardware build per our configuration specifications  perform a final test  and then image and drop ship the product directly to our customers 
our safeword product line includes a small token  available in various designs 
we source these tokens through electronics assembly manufacturers located in china 
the majority of the materials used in our manufacturing operations are industry standard parts 
typical materials required are media and media duplication services  user documentation and other printed materials  product packaging  and computer systems computer servers  computer peripherals  memory disk drives  and storage devices 
research and development our internal engineering staff performs internal development of new products and features

in addition  we will introduce new products as market demand develops for such products 
we design our products so that they support emerging or evolving security and content standards  such as hypertext transfer protocol http  extensible markup language xml  simple mail transfer protocol smtp  the public key cryptography standards pkcs  ipsec  lightweight directory access protocol ldap  internet protocol version ipv  secure sockets layer ssl  and others 
patents and proprietary technology we rely on patent  trademark  copyright  and trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements  and other methods to protect our proprietary rights 
we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents relating to computer security software and hardware products 
we believe that our patents are broad and fundamental to information security computer products 
our success depends  in part  upon our proprietary software and security technology 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary expertise that we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants  and other parties 
we have used  registered  and or applied to register certain trademarks and service marks to distinguish genuine secure computing products  technologies and services from those of our competitors in the us and in foreign countries and jurisdictions 
we enforce our trademark  service mark and trade name rights in the us and abroad

risk factors the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by us from time to time 
we may be unable to integrate our operations successfully and realize all of the anticipated benefits of the mergers with ciphertrust and cyberguard 
our mergers with ciphertrust and cyberguard involve the integration of companies that previously have operated independently  which is a complex  costly and time consuming process 
the difficulties of combining the companies operations include  among other things coordinating geographically disparate organizations  systems and facilities  integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds  consolidating corporate and administrative functions  consolidating research and development  and manufacturing operations  coordinating sales and marketing functions  retaining key employees  and preserving the research and development  collaboration  distribution  marketing  promotion and other important relationships of the companies 
the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of the combined company s business and the loss of key personnel 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the merger and the integration of the two companies operations could harm the business  results of operations  financial condition or prospects of the combined company after the mergers 
we believe that the operation integration of cyberguard is essentially complete 
however  as of december   we have only twelve months of combined operations  and we may  in the future  encounter again any or all of the difficulties in operation integration we have faced in the period since the merger with cyberguard  particularly due to the ongoing integration of ciphertrust 
we expect the integration of ciphertrust to be completed in we have experienced operating losses in the past and may experience operating losses in the future 
in we incurred operating profit of  in the quarter ended march  and operating losses of million  million  and million in the quarters ended june   september   and december   respectively 
in we had continuing operating profit  although we have incurred operating losses in the past 
if we are unable to attain operating profits in the future  our stock price may decline  which could cause you to lose part or all of your investment 
in we were cash flow positive  however  we have experienced negative cash flow in the past and may experience negative cash flow in the future 
if  at that time  sources of financing are not available  we may not have sufficient cash to satisfy working capital requirements 
we believe that we have sufficient financial resources to satisfy our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain an additional credit facility at that time or sooner if our plans change or if we expend cash sooner than anticipated 
any additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our failure to obtain financing at that time could result in our insolvency and the loss to investors of their entire investment in our common stock 
if we fail to meet the borrowing requirements under our credit agreement  we may be unable to obtain necessary short term financing and if we default on a secured loan  material assets of ours could be subject to forfeiture 
we currently are party to a senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by citigroup and ubs investment bank which provides us with a million term loan facility  a million revolving 
table of contents credit facility and a swingline loan sub facility 
as of december   we had million of outstanding indebtedness 
of this indebtedness  approximately million bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing interest rates 
an increase in interest rates would have a negative impact on our earnings due to an increase in interest expense 
as is typical for credit facilities of this sort  the credit agreement for such credit facility imposes certain restrictions on us  including limitations on additional indebtedness  capital expenditures  restricted payments  the incurrence of liens  transactions with affiliates and sales of assets 
in addition  the credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants  including maintaining leverage and interest coverage ratios and capital expenditure limitations 
we can offer no assurances that we will be able to comply with such financial covenants when a loan is needed or continue to comply with such covenants when a loan is outstanding 
if we fail to satisfy these covenants or if we are unable to meet the conditions for borrowing under our credit agreement when funds are required  we could be prevented from meeting our payment obligations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial conditional and operating results 
further  our obligations under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our material assets  including real and personal property  inventory  accounts  intellectual property and other intangibles 
if we default under our credit agreement for any reason and are unable to cure the default pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  our lenders could take possession of any and all of our assets in which they hold a security interest  including intellectual property  and dispose of those assets to the extent necessary to pay off our debts  which could materially harm our business 
our significant stockholders could have significant influence over us 
warburg pincus beneficially owns of the outstanding shares of secure computing series a preferred stock convertible into approximately million shares or of secure computing common stock on a fully diluted basis 
the shares of series a preferred stock are convertible into shares of our common stock at the holder s option  at a rate determined by dividing the aggregate liquidation preference of the shares of series a preferred stock to be converted by 
this liquidation preference  and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred stock  accretes at the rate of per year  compounded semi annually over time 
subject to certain exceptions and limitations  the liquidation preference shall accrete for months from the date of issuance  giving warburg pincus approximately million shares  or of our company on a fully accreted basis 
also  warburg pincus holds a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an initial per share exercise price of 
additionally  warburg pincus is entitled to nominate a member to our board of directors and the consent of the holders of the series a preferred stock is required for certain corporate actions 
jay chaudhry  vice chairman of the board and chief strategy officer  beneficially owns  shares of secure computing common stock  or of secure computing common stock on a fully diluted basis 
richard scott  a member of our board of directors  beneficially owns  shares of secure computing common stock  or of secure computing common stock on a fully diluted basis 
accordingly  warburg pincus  jay chaudhry  and richard scott could significantly influence the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to the stockholders for approval 
the interests of warburg pincus  jay chaudhry  and richard scott may differ from the interests of other stockholders 
holders of our series a preferred stock have rights that are senior to those of our common stock 
holders of our series a preferred stock are entitled to receive benefits not available to holders of our common stock 
these benefits include  but are not limited to  the following beginning july  shares of series a preferred stock will be entitled to receive semi annual dividends equal to of the series a preferred stock liquidation preference per year  which dividend may be paid in cash or added to the series a preferred stock liquidation preference  each share of series a preferred stock has an initial liquidation preference of and the liquidation preference accretes daily at an annual rate of  compounded semi annually  
table of contents upon a change of control of our company  warburg pincus may elect to i convert the shares of series a preferred stock into shares of common stock and receive the consideration due to the holders of common stock upon conversion  or ii cause us to redeem the series a preferred stock for cash at the liquidation preference then in effect  if a change of control occurs within years of the issuance of the series a preferred stock  the liquidation preference shall be an amount equal to the liquidation preference then in effect plus a premium of i if the change of control occurs prior to the first anniversary of the issuance of the series a preferred stock  ii if the change of control occurs after the first anniversary of the issuance of the series a preferred stock but prior to the second anniversary of the issuance of the series a preferred stock  iii if the change of control occurs after the second anniversary of the issuance of the series a preferred stock but prior to the fourth anniversary of the issuance of the series a preferred stock or iv if the change of control occurs after the fourth anniversary of the issuance of the series a preferred stock but prior to the fifth anniversary of the issuance of the series a preferred stock  holders of series a preferred stock have rights to acquire additional shares of our capital stock or rights to purchase property in the event of certain grants  issuances or sales  the conversion price of the series a preferred stock  which initially was per share  is subject to customary broad based weighted average anti dilution adjustments and other customary adjustments upon the issuance of shares of common stock below the conversion price  such as the issuance of shares and options to purchase shares in the ciphertrust acquisition  which resulted in an adjustment to the conversion price of the series a preferred stock to  the approval of holders of majority of the series a preferred stock is separately required to i approve changes to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws that adversely affect warburg pincus s rights  ii adopt any stockholder rights plan that would dilute the economic or voting interest of warburg pincus  iii incur certain debt  distribute assets  pay dividends or repurchase securities  iv create or issue any equity security with rights senior to or on parity with the series a preferred stock  v increase the size of our board of directors above nine members and vi take any action that adversely affects the rights  preferences and privileges of the series a preferred stock  and for so long as warburg pincus and its affiliates owns at least of its shares of series a preferred stock  the holders of series a preferred stock will have the right  voting as a separate class  to appoint one member to our board of directors 
the potential increase in sales from our relationships with various vendors of communications  security  and network management products or managed services may be reduced by requirements to provide volume price discounts and other allowances and significant costs incurred in customizing our products 
although we do not intend that such relationships be exclusive  we may be required to enter into an exclusive relationship or forego a significant sales opportunity 
to the extent we become dependent on actions by such parties  we could be adversely affected if the parties fail to perform as expected 
to minimize our risk  we often set minimum quotas with our customers as a condition of exclusivity 
competition from companies producing enterprise gateway security products could reduce our sales and market share 
the market for enterprise gateway security products is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change 
we believe that competition in this market is likely to persist and to intensify as a result of increasing demand for security products 
each of our individual products competes with a different group of competitors and products 
because the market for our products is highly competitive  it may be difficult to significantly increase our market share or our market share may actually decline 
our customers purchasing decisions are based heavily upon the quality of the security our products provide  the ease of installation and management  the ability to increase the numbers of individuals using our software simultaneously  and the flexibility of our software 
if a competitor can offer our customers a better 
table of contents solution in these areas or others and we are unable to rapidly offer a competitive product  we may lose customers 
competitors with greater resources could offer new solutions rapidly and at relatively low costs which could lead to increased price pressure  reduced margins  and a loss of market share 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical  and other competitive resources than we have 
our larger actual and potential competitors may be able to leverage an installed customer base and or other existing or future enterprise wide products  adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can 
additionally  we may lose product sales to these competitors because of their greater name recognition and reputation among potential customers 
our future potential competitors could include developers of operating systems or hardware suppliers not currently offering competitive enterprise gateway security products  including microsoft  sun microsystems  inc  ibm  computer associates  and hewlett packard 
if any of those potential competitors begins to offer enterprise wide security systems as a component of its hardware  demand for our solutions could decrease 
ultimately  approaches other than ours may dominate the market for enterprise gateway security products 
in the future  we may also face competition from our competitors and other parties that develop or acquire enterprise gateway security products based upon approaches that we employ 
there are no guarantees that our approach will dominate the market for enterprise gateway security products 
while we believe that we do not compete against manufacturers of other classes of security products  such as encryption  due to the complementary functions performed by such other classes  our customers may perceive such other companies as our competitors 
consolidation among competitors may erode our market share 
current and potential competitors have established  or may in the future establish  cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
if this were to occur  it could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
the trend toward multi function security solutions may result in a consolidation of the market around a smaller number of vendors that are able to provide the necessary breadth of products and services 
in the event that we are unable to internally develop all of the products needed for a complete  secure e business solution  we may need to acquire such technology or be acquired by a larger entity 
however  there can be no assurance that  in the event that we are not able to internally develop all of the products needed for an enterprise wide security solution  we will be able to acquire or merge with other entities on terms favorable to us and our stockholders 
the pricing policies of our competitors may impact the overall demand for our products and services and therefore  impacting our profitability 
some of our competitors are capable of operating at significant losses for extended periods of time  enabling them to sell their products and services at a lower price 
if we do not maintain competitive pricing  the demand for our products and or services  as well as our market share  may decline  having an adverse effect on our business 
from time to time  in responding to competitive pressures we lower the price of our products and services 
when this happens  if we are unable to reduce our component costs or improve operating efficiencies  our margins could be adversely affected 
other vendors may include products similar to ours in their hardware or software and render our products obsolete 
in the future  vendors of hardware and of operating systems or other software may continue to enhance their products or bundle separate products to include functions that are currently provided primarily by enterprise gateway security software 
if network security functions become standard features of computer hardware or of operating system software or other software  our products may become obsolete and unmarketable  particularly if the quality of these security features is comparable to that of our products 
furthermore  even if the enterprise gateway security and or management functions provided as standard features 
table of contents by hardware providers or operating systems or other software is more limited than that of our products  our customers might accept this limited functionality in lieu of purchasing additional software 
sales of our products would suffer materially if we were then unable to develop new enterprise gateway security and management products to further enhance operating systems or other software and to replace any obsolete products 
if an oem customer reduces or delays purchases  our revenue may decline and or our business could be adversely affected 
we currently have formed relationships with several oems including cisco  blue coat  mcafee  computer associates  f networks  inc and network appliance 
if we fail to sell to such oems in the quantities expected  or if any oem terminates our relationship  this could adversely affect our reputation  the perception of our products and technology in the marketplace and the growth of our business  and your investment in our common stock may decline in value 
technology in the enterprise gateway security market is changing rapidly  and if we fail to develop new products that are well accepted  our market share will erode 
to compete successfully  we must enhance our existing products and develop and introduce new products in a timely manner 
our net sales and operating results could be materially affected if we fail to introduce new products on a timely basis 
the rate of new enterprise gateway security product introductions is substantial and security products have relatively short product life cycles 
our customer requirements and preferences change rapidly 
our net sales and operating results will be materially affected if the market adopts  as industry standards  solutions other than those we employ 
denial of our patent applications or invalidation or circumvention of our patents may weaken our ability to compete in the enterprise gateway security market 
while we believe that our pending applications relate to patentable devices or concepts  there can be no assurances that any pending or future patent applications will be granted 
there is also the risk that a current or future patent  regardless of whether we are an owner or a licensee of such patent  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  there are no assurances that the rights granted under a patent or under licensing agreements will provide competitive advantages to us 
if another party alleges that we infringe its patents or proprietary rights  we may incur substantial litigation costs 
other than a claim made by finjan software ltd  we are not aware of any third party claims that we or our products have infringed a patent or other proprietary rights 
however  the computer technology market is characterized by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation 
intellectual property litigation is complex and expensive  and the outcome of such litigation is difficult to predict 
in the event that a third party were to make a claim of infringement against us  we could be required to devote substantial resources and management time to the defense of such claim  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
disclosure of our trade secrets or proprietary information may undermine our competitive advantages 
there can be no assurances that the confidentiality agreements protecting our trade secrets and proprietary expertise will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors 
if the use of public switched networks such as the internet does not continue to grow  our market and ability to sell our products and services may be limited 
our sales also depend upon a robust industry and infrastructure for providing access to public switched networks  such as the internet 
if the infrastructure or complementary products necessary to take these networks into viable commercial marketplaces are not developed or  if developed  these networks do not become and continue to be viable commercial marketplaces  our net sales and operating results could suffer 
our reliance on third party manufacturers of hardware components and subassemblies that are used in our appliances and safeword token product lines could cause a delay in our ability to fill orders 
we currently purchase the hardware components for our appliance and safeword token product lines from several major suppliers 
delays in receiving components would harm our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis and net sales and operating results could suffer 

table of contents our product lines are not diversified beyond providing enterprise gateway security solutions to our customers  and any drop in the demand for enterprise gateway security products would materially harm our business 
substantially all of our revenue comes from sales of enterprise gateway security products and related services 
we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future 
as a result  if for any reason our sales of these products and services are impeded  our net sales and operating results will be significantly reduced 
our stock price is highly volatile  which may cause our investors to lose money and may impair our ability to raise money  if necessary 
the price of our common stock  like that of many technology companies  has fluctuated widely 
during  our stock price ranged from a per share high of to a low of 
fluctuation in our stock price may cause our investors to lose money and impair our ability to raise additional capital  if necessary 
factors that may affect stock price volatility include unexpected fluctuations in operating results  our competitors or us announcing technological innovations or new products  general economic conditions and weaknesses in geographic regions of the world  threat of terrorist attacks or acts of war in the us or abroad  developments with respect to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors  our ability to successfully execute our business plan and compete in the enterprise gateway security industry  relatively low trading volume  product failures  and analyst reports and media stories 
if our products fail to function properly or are not properly designed  our reputation may be harmed  and customers may make product liability and warranty claims against us 
our customers rely on our enterprise gateway security products to prevent unauthorized access to their networks and data transmissions 
these customers include major financial institutions  defense related government agencies protecting national security information  and other large organizations 
these customers use our products to protect confidential business information with commercial value far in excess of our net worth 
therefore  if our products malfunction or are not properly designed  we could face warranty and other legal claims  which may exceed our ability to pay 
we seek to reduce the risk of these losses by attempting to negotiate warranty disclaimers and liability limitation clauses in our sales agreements 
however  these measures may ultimately prove ineffective in limiting our liability for damages 
in addition to any monetary liability for the failure of our products  an actual or perceived breach of network or data security at one of our customers could harm the market s perception of our products and our business 
the harm could occur regardless of whether that breach is attributable to our products 
we also face the more general risk of bugs and other errors in our software 
software products often contain undetected errors or bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released  and software products or media may contain undetected viruses 
errors or bugs may also be present in software that we license from third parties and incorporate into our products 
errors  bugs  or viruses in our products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance  recalls of hardware products incorporating the software  or loss of data 
our net sales and operating results could be materially reduced if we experience delays or difficulties with new product introductions or product enhancements 
if we lose a significant customer  we will realize smaller profits 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers 
for example  our top five customers made up of our sales in if we lose any of these customers or if our revenues from any of these customers are reduced  and we fail to replace the customer or fail to increase sales from other customers  we will incur smaller profits 

table of contents if we fail to collect amounts due from our customers on a timely basis  our cash flow and operating results may suffer 
because the timing of our revenues is difficult to predict and our expenses are often difficult to reduce in the short run  management of our cash flow is very important to us 
like most companies  we anticipate that a portion of the amounts owed to us will never be paid 
however  if our actual collection of amounts owed to us is less than we have estimated  we will have less cash to fund our operations than we anticipated  and our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  collection of amounts due us from sales to international customers generally takes longer than for other sales 
therefore  if our sales to international customers increase as a percentage of our total revenue  the average number of days it takes for us to collect amounts due from our customers may increase 
if there is an increase in the time required for us to collect amounts due us  we will have less cash to fund our operations than we anticipated 
this in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
we have taken and may from time to time take various forms of action to manage the amounts due us from customers and grant customer discounts in exchange for earlier payment 
quarterly net sales and operating results depend on the volume and timing of orders received  which may be affected by large individual transactions and which sometimes are difficult to predict 
our quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of other factors  including the timing of the introduction or enhancement of products by us or our competitors  the size  timing  and shipment of individual orders  market acceptance of new products  changes in our operating expenses  personnel departures and new hires and the rate at which new personnel become productive  mix of products sold  changes in product pricing  development of our direct and indirect distribution channels  costs incurred when anticipated sales do not occur  and general economic conditions 
sales of our products generally involve a significant commitment of capital by customers  with the attendant delays frequently associated with large capital expenditures 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle for our products is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control 
we are often required to ship products shortly after we receive orders  and consequently  order backlog  if any  at the beginning of any period has in the past represented only a small portion  if any  of that period s expected revenue 
as a result  our product sales in any period substantially depends on orders booked and shipped in that period 
we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
if customer demand falls below anticipated levels  it could seriously harm our operating results 
in addition  our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels  and a high percentage of our expenses are generally fixed in the short term 
based on these factors  a small fluctuation in the timing of sales can cause operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
the internet may become subject to increased regulation by government agencies 
due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet  covering issues such as user privacy  pricing and characteristics  and quality of products 
table of contents and services 
in addition  the adoption of laws or regulations may slow the growth of the internet  which could in turn decrease the demand for our products and increase our cost of doing business or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents  share rights agreement  and delaware law could discourage a takeover or future financing 
the terms of our certificate of incorporation and share rights agreement permit our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges  and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the board may authorize the issuance of additional preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could materially weaken the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
further  provisions of delaware law  our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws  such as a classified board and limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings  and provisions of our share rights agreement could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer  proxy contest  or other takeover attempts 
the ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to develop our products and manage our business is extremely important  and our failure to do so could harm our business 
we believe our success depends to a large extent upon a number of key technical and management employees 
we may be unable to achieve our sales and operating performance objectives unless we can attract and retain technically qualified and highly skilled engineers and sales  consulting  technical  financial  operations  marketing  and management personnel 
these personnel are particularly important to our research and development efforts and  as such  we employ a large number of technical personnel holding advanced degrees and special professional certification 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  and we expect it to remain so for the foreseeable future 
we may not be successful in retaining our existing key personnel and in attracting and retaining the personnel we require 
our operating results and our ability to successfully execute our business plan will be adversely affected if we fail to retain and increase our key employee population 
our international operations subject us to risks related to doing business in foreign countries 
international sales are a substantial portion of our business 
although all of our sales are payable in us dollars as of december   several factors could make it difficult for customers from foreign countries to purchase our products and services or pay us for obligations already incurred 
such factors include severe economic decline in one of our major foreign markets  and substantial decline in the exchange rate for foreign currencies with respect to the us dollar 
a decline in our international sales or collections of amounts due us from customers could materially affect our operations and financial conditions 
for fiscal year  of our total revenue came from international sales compared to in a very large drop in our sales or collections of amounts due us in these specific countries as a result of recession or other economic or political disturbances would likely harm our net sales and operating results 
in addition  we face a number of general risks inherent in doing business in international markets including  among others unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  legal uncertainty regarding liability  threat of terrorist attacks or acts of war  
table of contents political instability  potentially greater difficulty in collecting amounts due us  longer periods of time to collect amounts due us  and a higher rate of piracy of our products in countries with a high incidence of software piracy

in we embarked on a strategy to significantly increase our presence in the industry and to define and become the leader in the enterprise gateway security market 
we believe that our acquisitions of cyberguard and ciphertrust in have laid a strong foundation for our future success 
through the ciphertrust acquisition in  we acquired trustedsource technology and entered the messaging gateway security market 
we believe trustedsource technology is the most precise and comprehensive internet host reputation system in the world  and we are rolling this system into many of our product lines as a key cornerstone of global intelligence security 
recognizing that messaging is now a primary business application in most enterprises  we have implemented a strategy to comprehensively address both inbound and outbound threats and to help our customers insure compliance with federally mandated requirements for the protection of sensitive data 
our messaging gateway security products include ironmail  ironim  radar  and secure computing edge 
also in  we added the webwasher web gateway security product to our web security gateway product line through the cyberguard acquisition 
web gateway security appliances protect enterprises from malware  data leakage  and internet misuse  while helping to ensure policy enforcement  regulatory compliance  and a productive application environment 
this year we continued to differentiate our utm appliance from the competition with demonstrable zero hour attack protections on high profile internet attacks such as the sendmail vulnerability in march and microsoft windows metafile wmf attack in january 
we also announced plans to merge our newly acquired cyberguard firewall vpn technologies tsp and classic with our sidewinder g security appliance in our next generation utm appliance that has come to market in the first quarter of the cyberguard acquisition also brought to us a new paradigm in enterprise central management with the command center which we will continue to leverage going forward 
we believe command center s ability to do administration  configuration  monitoring  and management of software updates for a global appliance deployment coupled with our security reporter product s central reporting  and full out of the box compliance reports  continue to ensure that both medium and large customers see our network gateway appliances as the product of choice

income taxes 
during  we recorded income tax expense of million 
of this million income tax expense  a non cash expense of million is related to a net tax valuation allowance recorded on our net deferred tax assets 
we were unable to benefit from the initial release of valuation allowance on utilized acquired net operating losses  and needed to provide tax expense for the subsequent valuation allowance reapplied to the remaining net operating losses 
this was a result of changes in circumstances due to recent acquisitions that caused a change in judgment regarding the realizability of our net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter 
the remainder of the income tax expense is related to current income tax components such as  alternative minimum income tax  and state and foreign income taxes 
this is compared with  of income tax expense recorded in which consisted of  for alternative minimum tax expense   for state income tax expense and  for various foreign income tax expenses 

table of contents federal alternative minimum tax was provided on the portion of our alternative minimum taxable income which could not be entirely offset by the alternative tax net operating loss deduction carryforward which we have available 
similar to  we anticipate that we will be in an alternative minimum taxable income position in current tax law provides that part or all of the amount of the alternative minimum tax paid can be carried forward indefinitely and credited against federal regular tax in future tax years to the extent the regular tax liability exceeds the alternative minimum tax in those years 
for  the reversal of million of the tax valuation allowance related to acquired net operating losses was recorded as a decrease to goodwill in the balance sheet and not as a benefit to tax expense in the income statement 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have assessed the likelihood that the net deferred tax assets will be realized 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the consideration of a valuation allowance in all circumstances  if the conclusion is not more likely than not a valuation allowance is required 
we have determined that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets of million at december  will be realized based on our expected future reversals of certain deferred tax liabilities 
we have a net deferred tax liability recorded in our balance sheet that consists primarily of indefinite lived intangible assets that are not deductible for tax purposes and therefore cannot be used to realize additional reversing deferred tax assets

we have provided a complete valuation allowance on primarily all of these acquired losses are fully valued against  and upon release of the valuation allowance  a portion of the benefit will go to the balance sheet to reduce goodwill instead of a benefit to the income tax provision 
as of december  we have deducted million related to stock option exercises 
the tax benefit in excess of book expense from these stock option exercises will be recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital upon utilization of the net operating losses under the financial statement approach to recognizing the tax benefits associated with stock option deductions 
of the remaining benefit associated with the carryforwards  approximately million has yet to be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
however  there are no assurances that the tax benefit of these carryforwards will be available to offset future income tax expense when taxable income is realized 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal  state  and foreign tax authorities 
from time to time  these audits result in proposed assessments 
during the fourth quarter of  we reached a settlement with the internal revenue service regarding all assessments proposed with respect to the ciphertrust federal income tax return for the internal revenue service has commenced its examination of ciphertrusts federal income tax returns for and in our opinion  the final resolution of these audits will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
we anticipate the completion of these field audits during estimates were used in the determination of our provision for income taxes  current income taxes payable  as well as in our deferred tax asset and liability analysis 
these estimates take into account current tax laws and our interpretation of these current tax laws within the various taxing jurisdictions within which we operate

we anticipate using available cash to fund growth in operations  invest in capital equipment  acquire businesses  license technology or products related to our line of business  and make additional payments on our long term debt 
we expect to spend approximately million on capital expenditures in a summary of our total contractual cash obligations as of december  is as follows in thousands total payments due by period less than one year one to three years three to five years after five years operating leases  net of subleases principal and interest payments on debt total contractual cash obligations we believe that we have sufficient financial resources available to fund our current working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in addition to the cash on hand  we have a million revolving credit facility available pursuant to a credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks led by citigroup and ubs investment bank which was signed in august we intend to utilize the funds available through the credit facility for general working capital and ongoing corporate purposes as deemed necessary 
our credit facility agreement contains various covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness  capital expenditures  restricted payments  the incurrence of liens  transactions with affiliates and sales of assets

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
management regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical factors and other factors that are believed to be relevant under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions  estimates  or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from two sources i sales of products  including hardware  subscriptions  software licenses  and royalties and ii sales of services  including maintenance arrangements to provide upgrades and customer support  professional services  and contracted development work 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop revenue from products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection is probable 
subscription based contracts are generally for  or months in duration 
subscription revenue along with maintenance revenue for providing product upgrades and customer support are deferred and recognized ratably over the service period beginning with the month the subscription or service begins 
when arrangements contain multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  we recognize revenue for the delivered elements using the residual method 
for arrangements containing multiple elements where vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  we defer revenue for the delivered and undelivered elements and then recognize revenue on all elements over the service period 
in instances where an entire arrangement is deferred due to lack of vsoe of fair value on an undelivered element  the revenue recognized over the service period is allocated to products and services revenue based on the value of the elements as presented on the customer s purchase order which approximates an allocation proportionate to our list price 
we also identify costs primarily hardware component costs that are directly associated with product revenues that have been deferred due to lack of vsoe of fair value on an undelivered element and we defer these costs at the time of shipment and recognize them as cost of sales in proportion to the product revenue as it is recognized over the service term 
we sell our products either directly to an end user  or indirectly through our channel of resellers and distributors our channel partners 
when selling through our channel we require our channel partners to provide evidence of end user sell through 
if we are unable to obtain end user evidence at the time we fulfill the order from a channel partner  we do not recognize revenue until the channel partner supplies end user information  the product has been shipped  and all other criteria of sop have been met  with the exception of sales to our distributors who stock our snapgear product line 
we recognize revenue  net of estimated returns  upon shipment of our snapgear product line as we have sufficient return history to establish a reserve and we are not able to receive end user evidence due to the high volume sales of this low price point product 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivables 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors including historical write off experience  the need for specific customer reserves  the aging of our receivables  customer creditworthiness  changes in our customer payment cycles  and current economic trends 
historically  our allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate based on actual results 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents business combinations 
when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually  or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value  including the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 
to determine our reporting unit s fair value in the current year evaluation  we used a valuation technique based on multiples of revenue 
if management s estimates of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our goodwill could change significantly 
such change could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we assess the impairment of acquired developed technology and other identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value 
our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue  operating costs  and other relevant factors 
if management s estimates of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our acquired developed technology and other identifiable intangible assets could change significantly 
such change could result in impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets 
we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas no 
requires the consideration of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some component or all of the benefits of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
share based compensation 
prior to january   we accounted for share based employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  we recorded no share based employee compensation expense for options granted under our current stock option plans during the year ended december  as all options granted under those plans had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we also recorded no compensation expense in those periods in connection with our employee stock purchase plan espp as the purchase price of the stock was not less than of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period 
in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we provided pro forma net income and net income per share disclosures for each period prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment  as if we had applied the fair value based method in measuring compensation expense for our share based compensation plans 

table of contents effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  we recognized compensation expense for share based payments that vested during the year ended december  using the following valuation methods a for share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   the grant date fair value was estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b for share based payments granted on or after january   the grant date fair value was estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment  which provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas no 
r 
we have applied the provisions of sab no 
in our adoption of sfas no 
r 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted and the discount offered through our espp using the black scholes model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
see note for information on the impact of our adoption of sfas no 
r and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share based employee compensation 
in addition  we began offering restricted shares in and we intend to continue to do so in the future 
derivative instrument 
in september  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement which is required to be accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
our interest rate cap agreement applies to b  referred to as a cash flow hedge 
for a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is immediately recognized in income 
inflation to date  we have not been significantly affected by inflation 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
fin creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions and clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
specifically under fin  the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based upon the technical merits of the position 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  as prescribed in the interpretation  the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at january  we will adopt fin effective january  as required 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact which the adoption of fin will have on our financial position  cash flows  and results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  clarifies the 
table of contents definition of fair value within that framework  and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is intended to increase consistency and comparability among fair value estimates used in financial reporting 
as such  sfas no 
applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  except for the measurement of share based payments 
sfas no 
does not apply to accounting standards that require or permit measurements that are similar to  but not intended to represent  fair value 
fair value  as defined in sfas no 
 is the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability and therefore represents an exit price  not an entry price 
the exit price is the price in the principal market in which the reporting entity would transact 
further  that price is not adjusted for transaction costs 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
sfas no 
will be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied 
we are currently assessing the impact of adoption of sfas no 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the us  australia  and germany and sell them worldwide 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since our sales are currently priced in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets and our accounts receivable more difficult to collect 
we believe that our international entities are subject to risks typical of any international entity  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in the interest rates on certain outstanding debt 
as of december   we had million of outstanding indebtedness 
of this indebtedness  approximately million bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing interest rates 
based on the average outstanding debt for fiscal  a basis point change in interest rates would change interest expense by approximately  in fiscal we also hold an equity interest in a privately held technology company 
this investment was recorded at cost and is reported in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  this investment had a carrying value of million
