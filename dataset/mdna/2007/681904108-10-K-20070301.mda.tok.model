the new prescription drug benefit under medicare part d part d became effective on january  as a result  omnicare experienced a significant shift in payor mix as a of annual sales during the year ended december  the payor mix for the full year was approximately medicare  medicaid  private pay  third party and facility  and other sources 
prior to the implementation of the new medicare part d program  most of the part d residents served by the company were reimbursed under state medicaid programs and  to a lesser extent  private pay sources 
as expected with such a significant change in payor source and reimbursement system  the year ended december  was a transition period as the company devoted considerable time  effort and resources to addressing certain administrative  operational and payment issues associated with the implementation of part d 
as a result  the company incurred incremental expenses of approximately million pretax approximately million aftertax during the year ended december  comprising temporary labor  administrative and operating costs incurred in connection with the implementation of the new medicare part d drug benefit 
these expenditures were necessary to support the billing and cash collection functions  as well as handle the disruption in the timing of work flow and delivery of medications created by these implementation issues 
while considerable progress has been made in addressing many of the part d implementation issues  omnicare continues to devote resources to the ongoing resolution of these matters and expects incremental part d transition expenses to continue until such time that the various implementation issues are resolved 
the results for the year ended december  were also impacted by the unilateral reduction by unitedhealth group and its affiliates united in the reimbursement rates paid by united to omnicare under its pharmacy network contract for services rendered by omnicare to beneficiaries of united s drug benefit plans under the medicare part d program 
the differential in rates that resulted from united s action reduced sales and operating profit for the year ended december  by approximately million approximately million aftertax 
this matter is currently the subject of litigation initiated by omnicare in federal court 
see further discussion at the legal proceedings section at part i  item of this filing 
the company s consolidated gross profit of  million increased million for the full year from the same prior year period amount of  million  due primarily to the increase in sales discussed in the pharmacy services segment and cro services segment captions below 
gross profit as a percentage of total net sales of in the year ended december   was slightly higher than the experienced during positively impacting overall gross profit margin were the company s purchasing leverage associated with the procurement of pharmaceuticals  the increased use of generic drugs  the impact of productivity enhancements  a favorable payor mix shift offset in large measure by the aforementioned united reimbursement rate reduction  cost savings associated with the integration of neighborcare  inc neighborcare  and the addition of the higher margin rxcrossroads  llc 
rxcrossroads and excellerx  inc excellerx businesses 
these favorable year over year factors were offset by competitive pricing pressures  medicaid reimbursement reductions in late although the impact from medicaid reimbursement cuts now is much lower than seen historically due to the shift in payor mix largely from medicaid to medicare part d  part d transition expenses and special charges 
specifically  gross profit for the year ended december  was impacted by a special charge related to the quality control  product recall and fire issues at its heartland repackaging facility  of which million impacted gross profit  and the michigan medicaid matter  of which million impacted gross profit  as further discussed in special charges caption below 
while progress has been made in addressing many of the heartland matters  omnicare continues to devote resources to the ongoing resolution of these matters and expects incremental expenses to continue until such time that the various matters are resolved 
in order to replace the repackaging capacity of the heartland facility  on february   omnicare entered into an agreement for the repackaging services division of cardinal health to serve as the contract repackager for pharmaceutical volumes previously repackaged at the heartland facility 
the agreement initially extends through october increased leverage in purchasing favorably impacts gross profit and is primarily derived through discounts  rebates and other price concessions from suppliers 
leveraging of fixed and variable overhead costs primarily relates to generating higher sales volumes from pharmacy facilities with no or limited increases in fixed costs eg  rent  depreciation  etc 
and negligible to moderate increases in variable costs eg  utilities  labor  etc  as well as the elimination of pharmacies through the company s productivity and consolidation initiatives  further discussed below 
the company believes it will be able to continue to leverage fixed and variable overhead costs through both internal and acquired growth 
government and other reimbursement formulas generally adjust to take into account drug price inflation or deflation 
in order to enhance its gross profit margins  the company strategically allocates its resources to those activities that will increase internal sales growth and favorably impact sales mix  or will lower costs 
in addition  through the ongoing development of its pharmaceutical purchasing programs  the company is able to obtain volume discounts and thereby manage its pharmaceutical costs 
omnicare s selling  general and administrative operating expenses for the year ended december  of million were higher than the comparable year amount of million by million  due primarily to the overall growth of the business  including the full year impact of the acquisitions  including neighborcare  excellerx and rxcrossroads 
operating expenses as a percentage of total net sales were in  representing an increase from the experienced in the comparable prior year period 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were unfavorably impacted by a million increase in amortization and depreciation expenses  largely related to the acquisitions  million pretax charge associated with retention payments for certain neighborcare employees  million pretax of additional equity based compensation expense for stock options and stock awards related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  increased legal and professional costs and the previously discussed temporary costs associated with the implementation of the new medicare part d drug benefit 
partially offsetting the increased operating expenses were the favorable impact of leveraging of fixed eg  rents and variable eg  utilities overhead costs over a larger sales base in than that which existed in and the company s continued productivity enhancements  including the ongoing restructuring program commenced in connection with the neighborcare acquisition and the commencement of the omnicare full potential plan  as further discussed in restructuring and other related charges caption below

as a precautionary measure  the company voluntarily and temporarily suspended operations at heartland 
during the time that the heartland facility has been closed  the company conducted certain environmental tests at the facility 
based on the results of these tests  which showed very low levels of beta lactam residue  and the time and expense associated with completing the necessary remediation procedures  as well as the short remaining term on the lease for the current facility  the company has decided not to reopen the heartland facility 
the company continues to work to address and resolve all issues and restore centralized repackaging to full capacity  however  the company cannot currently predict when such restructuring of operations will occur 
in order to temporarily replace the capacity of the heartland facility  the company ramped up production in its other repackaging facility  as well as onsite in its individual pharmacies for use by their patients 
as a result  omnicare has been and continues to be able to meet the needs of all of its client facilities and their residents

restructuring and other related charges omnicare full potential program in the second quarter of  the company commenced the implementation of the omnicare full potential plan  a major initiative designed to re engineer the company s pharmacy operating model to increase efficiency and enhance customer growth 
the omnicare full potential plan is expected to optimize resources across the entire organization by implementing best practices and a hub and spoke model whereby certain key support and production functions will be transferred to regional hubs specifically designed and managed to perform these tasks  with local spoke pharmacies focusing on time sensitive services and customer facing processes 
the omnicare full potential plan is expected to be completed over a month period and is estimated to generate pretax savings in the range of million to million annually upon completion of the initiative 
it is anticipated that approximately one half of these savings will be realized in cost of sales  and the remainder being realized in operating expenses 
the program is estimated to result in total pretax restructuring and other related charges of approximately million over this month period

the company recorded restructuring and other related charges for the omnicare full potential program of approximately million approximately million aftertax during the remainder of the overall restructuring charge will be recognized and disclosed over the and years as various phases of the project are finalized and implemented

approximately of these positions have been eliminated as of december  see further discussion at the restructuring and other related charges note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
program in the third quarter of  the company announced the implementation of certain consolidation plans and other productivity initiatives to streamline pharmacy services and contract research organization operations  including maximizing workforce and operating asset utilization  and producing a more cost efficient  operating infrastructure the program 
these consolidation and productivity initiatives were related  in part  to the integration of neighborcare 
given the geographic overlap of the neighborcare and omnicare pharmacies  substantial opportunities for consolidation existed at the time of acquisition 
while the majority of consolidations resulted in neighborcare pharmacies being consolidated into omnicare pharmacies  depending on location  capacity and operating performance  certain omnicare pharmacies were also identified for consolidation into neighborcare locations 
additionally  as part of the evaluation process on how best to integrate the two organizations  the company also focused broadly on ways to lower operating infrastructure costs to maximize efficiencies and asset utilization and identified opportunities to right size the business  streamline operations and eliminate redundant assets 
the consolidation activity and other productivity initiatives of the program resulted in the closure of omnicare facilities  of which were pharmacy operations 
additionally  there was a net reduction in force of approximately positions relating to the program 
of this reduction in force  approximately were in the pharmacy operations and the remaining reductions were at the corporate headquarters or the company s contract research operations 
restructuring activities in the contract research organization segment related primarily to facility lease obligations 
the company has generated in excess of million in pretax savings from pharmacy closures and other consolidation and productivity initiatives implemented in connection with these activities 
the program initiatives required cumulative restructuring and other related charges of approximately million before taxes through the third quarter of  which related to the costs associated with the consolidation of omnicare pharmacies and the other consolidation and productivity initiatives described above

in accordance with eitf issue no 
 the company included million and million of reimbursable out of pockets in its cro services segment reported revenue and direct cost amounts for the years ended december  and  respectively

operating income in the cro services segment was million in compared with million in as a percentage of the segment s revenue  operating income was in compared with in this decrease is primarily attributable to the previously mentioned restructuring charge  of which approximately million was included in the cro services segment  primarily relating to facility lease obligations 
operating income versus the comparable prior year period was also unfavorably affected  especially in the first three months of the year  by the impact of the clinimetrics acquisition  largely as a result of the early completion of a large data management project  the results of which were accepted by the fda more rapidly than anticipated 
this resulted in lower revenues to coincide with the existent operating cost structure  which has since been modified through certain productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts 
operating results were also impacted by several client driven cancellations and delays in the commencement of certain projects during the fourth quarter of  and reflects the somewhat volatile nature of this business given the numerous variables that are outside the company s control

in addition  the full year results included the previously discussed charge in connection with certain state medicaid audits related to prior periods  which lowered gross profit by approximately million 
the gross profit margin impact of these favorable year over year factors were more than offset by the addition of the large base of lower margin neighborcare business  the previously mentioned intensified competitive pricing and government reimbursement pressures  as well as the further market penetration of newer branded drugs targeted at the diseases of the elderly  which typically produce higher gross profit  but lower gross profit margins 
increased leverage in purchasing favorably impacts gross profit and is primarily derived through discounts  rebates and other price concessions from suppliers 
leveraging of fixed and variable overhead costs primarily relates to generating higher sales volumes from pharmacy facilities with no or limited increases in fixed costs eg  rent  depreciation  etc 
and negligible to moderate increases in variable costs eg  utilities  labor  etc  as well as the elimination of pharmacies through the company s productivity and consolidation initiatives  further discussed below 
the company believes it will be able to continue to leverage fixed and variable overhead costs through both internal and acquired growth 
government and other reimbursement formulas generally adjust to take into account drug price inflation or deflation 
in order to enhance its gross profit margins  the company strategically allocates its resources to those activities that will increase internal sales growth and favorably impact sales mix  or will lower costs 
in addition  through the ongoing development of its pharmaceutical purchasing programs  the company is able to obtain volume discounts and thereby manage its pharmaceutical costs 
omnicare s operating expenses for the year ended december  of million were higher than the comparable year amount of million by million  due primarily to the overall growth of the business  including the aforementioned completion of several acquisitions  including neighborcare  excellerx and rxcrossroads 
operating expenses as a percentage of total net sales totaled in  consistent with the prior year period rate of 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were unfavorably impacted by a million increase in amortization and depreciation expenses largely related to the acquisitions  the aforementioned million charge in connection with the legal settlement of certain contractual issues with two vendors  the aforementioned million charge for professional fees and expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of the new trust piers and the purchase of the company s senior subordinated notes due  and the aforementioned million charge for acquisition related expenses 
also initially impacting operating expenses were the acquisitions  including the addition of the neighborcare business  which had a higher operating cost structure at the time of the acquisition 
as the neighborcare integration plan is completed and expected cost synergies are realized  operating expenses as a percentage of net sales should be favorably impacted 
offsetting these factors were the favorable impact of leveraging fixed and variable overhead costs over a larger sales base in than that which existed in and the company s continued productivity enhancements  including the commencement of a restructuring program in connection with the neighborcare acquisition 
in addition  the full year ended december  included the previously discussed charge in connection with certain state medicaid audits related to prior periods  which increased operating expenses by approximately million 
investment income for the year ended december  of million was higher than the million earned in the comparable prior year period  primarily due to higher interest rates and average invested cash and plan asset balances versus the prior year 
interest expense for the year ended december  of million was higher than the million in the comparable prior year period primarily due to increased borrowings under the new debt issuances  as further discussed at the financial condition  liquidity and capital resources section of this md a 
in addition  interest expense for the year ended december  included the previously mentioned charges of approximately million  primarily related to the debt extinguishment and new debt issuance costs in connection with the company s financing plan 
the effective income tax rate was in  relatively consistent with the prior year rate of 
the effective tax rates in and are higher than the federal statutory rate largely as a result of the combined impact of state and local income taxes  various nondeductible expenses and tax accrual adjustments 
impact of inflation as previously mentioned  the company estimates that drug price inflation for its highest dollar volume products in each of the three years ended december  approximated to  which tends to impact sales and costs of sales at approximately the same level 
therefore  inflation has not materially affected omnicare s income from continuing operations  inasmuch as government and other reimbursement formulas generally adjust to take into account drug price inflation or deflation 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents plus restricted cash at december  were million compared with million at december  including restricted cash amounts of million and million  respectively 
the company generated positive net cash flows from operating activities of million during the year ended december   compared with net cash flows from operating activities of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
largely contributing to net cash flows from operating activities during the year ended december  were operating results during the period 
year over year cash flow was impacted by an increase in accounts receivable  including the impact of administrative and payment issues associated with the implementation of the new medicare part d drug benefit  resulting in outstanding net receivables for copays and rejected claims of approximately million and million at december   respectively 
in addition  cash flow from operations in was impacted by cash payments of million related to the litigation matters and million related to the heartland matters 
see further discussion of these matters at the commitments and contingencies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and the legal proceedings section at part i  item of this filing 
this unfavorable impact was partially offset by the first quarter return of a million deposit from one of the company s drug wholesalers 
cash flow from operations for also included the return of a million deposit from another of the company s drug wholesalers in connection with a change in accounts payable payment terms to more frequent  weekly payments 
the impact of these more frequent payments on cash flow in slightly more than offset the million return of the deposit 
current year operating cash flows  invested cash  as well as proceeds from the first quarter of issuance of common stock  were used primarily for acquisition related payments  litigation related payments  capital expenditures  dividend payments and debt payments 
the company anticipates that operating cash flows will be unfavorably impacted by increased cash payments in for income tax payments and the funding of pension obligations  as compared to the tax payments and pension obligations funding levels of approximately million and million  respectively 
the income tax payments were favorably impacted by the special charges incurred in for litigation settlement payments and restructuring costs  a large federal tax overpayment credited from to  and incremental net operating loss carryforwards from the ncs healthcare and neighborcare acquisitions  which will not be available in without the impact of these items  the tax payments would have been approximately million 
income tax payments in are currently expected to be consistent with this million level  plus additional income tax payments of approximately million which will be paid in the first quarter of this combined estimated total tax payments amount of million for will be adjusted for the tax effects of any increase or decrease in pretax earnings over the earnings before the impact of any special charges 
further  the estimated aggregate contributions to rabbi trusts expected to be funded in relating to the company s pension obligations  based on the actuarial assumptions in place at year end  total approximately million  which is an increase of million over the contribution 
net cash used in investing activities was million  billion and million in  and  respectively 
acquisitions of businesses required cash payments of million including amounts payable pursuant to acquisition agreements relating to pre acquisitions in relating to acquisitions  which were primarily funded by the issuance of common stock  invested cash and operating cash flows 
acquisitions of businesses during and required cash payments of billion and million  respectively  including amounts payable pursuant to acquisition agreements relating to pre and pre acquisitions  which were primarily funded by proceeds from long term debt borrowings  the issuance of common stock and operating cash flows 
omnicare s capital requirements  in addition to the payment of debt and dividends  are primarily comprised of its acquisition program and capital expenditures  largely relating to investments in the company s information technology systems 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of billion for the year ended december  during  the company paid down million on the company s senior term a loan facility  maturing on july  the term loans 
borrowings during were primarily related to the company entering into the new billion credit agreement during the third quarter of  primarily to provide interim financing for the neighborcare  excellerx and rxcrossroads transactions 
the credit agreement consisted of a billion day loan facility  a five year million revolving credit facility due and a five year million senior term a loan facility due proceeds from the credit agreement were also utilized to retire the company s old revolving credit facility and old term a loan  resulting in net payments on these two borrowings of million during the year ended december  on december   the company completed a major refinancing undertaken primarily to provide long term financing for the neighborcare  excellerx and rxcrossroads transactions 
total gross proceeds from the refinancing were approximately billion from the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes due  million of senior subordinated notes due  million of convertible senior debentures due  and million of omnicare common stock excluding gross proceeds of approximately million received in january from the underwriters of the common stock offering exercising their option in part to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at per share 
the net proceeds from the refinancing were primarily utilized to pay off the interim financing provided by the billion day loan facility and the purchase of approximately million of the company s senior subordinated notes due pursuant to a tender offer and consent solicitation 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in net borrowings on the then existing credit facility totaled million in and were primarily used for payments related to the acquisition of businesses 
see further discussion of the company s financing activities at the debt note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings on the million revolving credit facility  and million in borrowings were outstanding on the new senior term a loan facility 
as of december   the company had approximately million outstanding relating to standby letters of credit  substantially all of which are subject to automatic annual renewals 
on february   the company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of cents per share for an indicated annual rate of cents per common share for  which is consistent with annual dividends paid per common share for the  and years 
aggregate dividends of million paid during were modestly higher than the million and million paid in and  respectively  due to the late and early common stock offering  as further discussed at the public offering of common stock note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
there were no material commitments and contingencies outstanding at december   other than the contractual obligations summarized in the disclosures about aggregate contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements caption below  certain acquisition related payments potentially due in the future  including deferred payments  indemnification payments and contingent payments originating from earnout and other provisions that may become payable  as well as the matters discussed in the commitments and contingencies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the legal proceedings section at part i  item of this filing 
the company believes that net cash flows from operating activities  credit facilities and other short and long term debt financings will be sufficient to satisfy its future working capital needs  acquisition contingency commitments  debt servicing  capital expenditures and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
although the company has no current plans to refinance its indebtedness  issue additional indebtedness  or issue additional equity  the company currently believes that external sources of financing are readily available and will access them as deemed appropriate although no assurances can be given regarding the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future 
disclosures about aggregate contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements aggregate contractual obligations the following summarizes the company s aggregate contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the company s liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands total less than year years years after years debt obligations a capital lease obligations a operating lease obligations purchase obligations b other current obligations c other long term obligations d subtotal future interest relating to debt and capital lease obligations e total contractual cash obligations a the noted obligation amounts represent the principal portion of the associated debt obligations 
details of the company s outstanding debt instruments can be found in the debt note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
b purchase obligations primarily consist of open inventory purchase orders  as well as obligations for other goods and services  at period end 
c other current obligations primarily consist of accounts payable at period end 
d other long term obligations are largely comprised of pension and excess benefit plan obligations  acquisition related liabilities and the obligation associated with the interest rate swap agreement discussed below 
e represents estimated future interest costs based on the stated fixed interest rate of the debt  or the variable interest rate in effect at period end for variable interest rate debt 
the estimated future interest costs presented in this table do not include any amounts potentially payable associated with the contingent interest and interest reset provisions of the company s convertible debentures 
to the extent that any debt would be paid off by omnicare prior to the stated due date or refinanced  the estimated future interest costs would change accordingly 
as of december   the company had approximately million outstanding relating to standby letters of credit  substantially all of which are subject to automatic annual renewals 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company had two unconsolidated entities  omnicare capital trust i  a statutory trust formed by the company the old trust and the new trust  which were established for the purpose of facilitating the offerings of the trust preferred income equity redeemable securities due the old trust piers and the new trust piers  respectively 
for financial reporting purposes  the old trust and new trust are treated as equity method investments of the company 
the old trust and new trust are owned finance subsidiaries of the company 
the company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the securities of the old trust and new trust 
the old debentures issued by the company to the old trust and the new debentures issued by the company to the new trust in connection with the issuance of the old trust piers and the new trust piers  respectively  are presented as a single line item on omnicare s consolidated balance sheet  and the related disclosures concerning the old trust piers and the new trust piers  the guarantees  and the old debentures and new debentures are included in omnicare s notes to consolidated financial statements 
omnicare records interest payable to the old trust and new trust as interest expense in its consolidated statement of income 
as of december   the company had no other unconsolidated entities  or any financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk omnicare s primary market risk exposure relates to variable interest rate risk through its borrowings 
accordingly  market risk loss is primarily defined as the potential loss in earnings due to higher interest rates on variable rate debt of the company 
the modeling technique used by omnicare for evaluating interest rate risk exposure involves performing sensitivity analysis on the variable rate debt  assuming a change in interest rates of basis points 
the company s debt obligations at december  include million outstanding under the variable rate term a loan at an interest rate of at december  a basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease pretax interest expense by approximately million per year  million borrowed on a variable rate term loan at an interest rate of at december  a basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease pretax interest expense by approximately million per year  million outstanding under its fixed rate senior notes  due  million outstanding under its fixed rate senior notes  due  million outstanding under its fixed rate senior notes  due  million outstanding under its fixed rate convertible debentures  due  and million outstanding under its fixed rate convertible debentures  due with an optional repurchase right of holders on december  
in connection with its offering of million of senior notes  during the second quarter of  the company entered into a swap agreement on all million of its aggregate principal amount of the senior notes 
under the swap agreement  which hedges against exposure to long term us dollar interest rates  the company receives a fixed rate of and pays a floating rate based on libor with a maturity of nine months  plus a spread of 
the estimated libor based floating rate including the spread was at december  a basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease pretax interest expense by approximately million per year 
the swap agreement  which matches the terms of the senior notes  is designated and accounted for as a fair value hedge 
the company is accounting for the swap agreement in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended  so changes in the fair value of the swap agreement are offset by changes in the recorded carrying value of the related senior notes 
the fair value of the swap agreement of approximately million at december  is recorded as a noncurrent liability and a reduction to the book carrying value of the related senior notes 
at december   the fair value of omnicare s variable rate debt facilities approximates the carrying value  as the effective interest rates fluctuate with changes in market rates 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt facilities is based on quoted market prices and is summarized as follows in thousands fair value of financial instruments december  financial instrument book value market value book value market value senior subordinated notes  due senior subordinated notes  due  gross senior subordinated notes  due senior subordinated notes  due junior subordinated convertible debentures  due convertible senior debentures  due embedded in the old trust piers  the new trust piers and the convertible debentures are two derivative instruments  specifically  a contingent interest provision and a contingent conversion parity provision 
in addition  the convertible debentures include an interest reset provision 
the embedded derivatives are periodically valued by a third party advisor  and at period end  the values of the derivatives embedded in the old trust piers  the new trust piers and the convertible debentures were not material 
however  the values are subject to change  based on market conditions  which could affect the company s future financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
the company has operations and revenue that occur outside of the us and transactions that are settled in currencies other than the us dollar  exposing it to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  the substantial portion of the company s operations and revenues and the substantial portion of the company s cash settlements are exchanged in us dollars 
therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates do not represent a substantial market risk exposure to the company 
the company does not have any financial instruments held for trading purposes 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in connection with the preparation of these financial statements  omnicare management is required to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  stockholders equity  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
on a regular basis  the company evaluates the estimates used  including those related to bad debts  contractual allowances  inventory valuation  impairment of goodwill  insurance accruals  pension obligations  income taxes  stock based compensation  legal and regulatory contingencies and other operating allowances and accruals 
management bases its estimates on a combination of factors  including historical experience  current conditions  feedback from outside advisors where feasible and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at the time and under the current circumstances 
the company s significant accounting policies are summarized in the description of business and summary of significant accounting policies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require significant management judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the determination of the registrant s financial position and operating results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
omnicare s critical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions require revision 
application of the critical accounting policies requires management s significant judgments  often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently and highly uncertain  including those matters further discussed below 
if actual results were to differ materially from the judgments and estimates made  the company s reported financial position and or operating results could be materially affected 
omnicare management continually reviews these estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies and estimates involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition omnicare recognizes revenue when products or services are delivered or provided to the customer 
pharmacy services segment a significant portion of the company s pharmacy services segment revenues from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products have been reimbursed by the federal medicare part d plan and  to a lesser extent  state medicaid programs 
payments for services rendered to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges 
the company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources  as well as other third party insurance payors  and records an estimated contractual allowance for certain sales and receivable balances at the revenue recognition date  to properly account for anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts 
accordingly  the total net sales and receivables reported in the company s financial statements are recorded at the amount ultimately expected to be received from these payors 
since billing functions of the company are largely computerized  enabling on line adjudication ie  submitting charges to medicare  medicaid or other third party payors electronically  with simultaneous feedback of the amount to be paid at the time of sale to record net revenues  exposure to estimating contractual allowance adjustments is limited primarily to unbilled and or initially rejected medicare  medicaid and third party claims oftentimes approved once additional information is provided to the payor 
the company evaluates several criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowances for unbilled and or initially rejected claims on a monthly basis  including historical trends based on actual claims paid  current contract and reimbursement terms  and changes in customer base and payor product mix 
contractual allowance estimates are adjusted to actual amounts as cash is received and claims are settled  and the aggregate impact of these resulting adjustments were not significant to the company s operations for any of the periods presented 
further  omnicare does not expect the reasonably possible effects of a change in estimate related to unsettled december  contractual allowance amounts from medicare  medicaid and third party payors to be significant to its future operating results  cash flows and consolidated financial position 
patient co payments are associated with medicare part d see further discussion below  certain state medicaid programs  medicare part b and certain third party payors and are typically not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered  but are billed to the individual as part of the company s normal billing procedures 
these co payments are subject to the company s normal accounts receivable collections procedures 
a patient may be dispensed prescribed medications typically no more than a day supply prior to insurance being verified in emergency situations  or for new facility admissions after hours or on weekends 
as soon as practicable typically the following business day  specific payor information is obtained so that the proper payor can be billed for reimbursement 
under certain circumstances  the company accepts returns of medications and issues a credit memo to the applicable payor 
the company estimates and accrues for sales returns based on historical return experience  giving consideration to the company s return policies 
product returns are processed in the period received and are not significant when compared to the overall sales and gross profit of the company 
contract research services segment a portion of the company s overall revenues relates to the contract research services cro segment  and is earned by performing services under contracts with various pharmaceutical  biotechnology  medical device and diagnostics companies  based on contract terms 
most of the contracts provide for services to be performed on a units of service basis 
these contracts specifically identify the units of service and unit pricing 
under these contracts  revenue is generally recognized upon completion of the units of service 
for time and materials contracts  revenue is recognized at contractual hourly rates  and for fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized using a method similar to that used for units of service 
the company s contracts provide for additional service fees for scope of work changes 
the company recognizes revenue related to these scope changes when underlying services are performed and realization is assured 
in a number of cases  clients are required to make termination payments in addition to payments for services already rendered 
any anticipated losses resulting from contract performance are charged to earnings in the period identified 
billings and payments are specified in each contract 
revenue recognized in excess of billings is classified as unbilled receivables  while billings in excess of revenue are classified as deferred revenue  on the respective lines of the consolidated balance sheets 
allowance for doubtful accounts collection of accounts receivable from customers is the company s primary source of operating cash flow and is critical to omnicare s operating performance and financial condition 
omnicare s primary collection risk relates to facility  private pay and part d customers 
the company provides a reserve for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
omnicare establishes this allowance for doubtful accounts using the specific identification approach  and considering such factors as historical collection experience ie  payment history and credit losses and creditworthiness  specifically identified credit risks  aging of accounts receivable by payor category  current and expected economic conditions and other relevant factors 
management reviews this allowance on an ongoing basis for appropriateness 
judgment is used to assess the collectibility of account balances and the economic ability of customers to pay 
the company computes and monitors its accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso in order to evaluate the liquidity and collection patterns of its accounts receivable 
dso is calculated by averaging the beginning and end of quarter accounts receivable  less contractual allowances and the allowance for doubtful accounts  to derive average accounts receivable  and dividing average accounts receivable by the sales amount excluding reimbursable out of pockets for the related quarter 
the resultant percentage is multiplied by days to derive the dso amount 
omnicare s dso approximated days and days at december  and  respectively  representing an overall increase of approximately days 
largely impacting the dso increase was the shift in payor mix from medicaid to medicare part d  representing a net increase of approximately days of the year over year dso increase approximately additional dsos for medicare part d  partially offset by a reduction in medicaid dsos of approximately days 
this net day dso increase resulted in an estimated increase in accounts receivable of million  including administrative and payment issues associated with the implementation of the new medicare part d drug benefit  resulting in outstanding net receivables for copays and rejected claims of approximately million and million at december   respectively 
also impacting the year over year dso was the overall increase in facility payor accounts receivable of approximately four days  or an estimated increase in accounts receivable of million  relating largely to several of the company s larger nursing home chains 
the remaining increase of one day relates to the aggregated impact of the company s other customer payor sources 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was million  compared with million at december  these allowances for doubtful accounts represented and of gross receivables net of contractual allowances as of december  and  respectively 
while there have been no significant changes in the company s bad debt expensing for the year ending december   unforeseen changes to future allowance for doubtful accounts percentages could materially impact the overall financial results and or financial position of the company 
for example  a one percentage point increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross receivables net of contractual allowances as of december  would result in an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts  as well as bad debt expense  of approximately million pretax 
the following table is an aging of the company s december  and gross accounts receivable net of allowances for contractual adjustments  and prior to allowances for doubtful accounts  aged based on payment terms and categorized based on the four primary overall types of accounts receivable characteristics in thousands december  current and days past due days and over past due total medicare part d and part b  medicaid and third party payors facility payors private pay payors cro total gross accounts receivable net of contractual allowance adjustments december  current and days past due days and over past due total medicaid  medicare part b and third party payors facility payors private pay payors cro total gross accounts receivable net of contractual allowance adjustments patient charges pending approval from medicare  medicaid and third party payors are primarily billed as private pay and  where applicable  are recorded net of an estimated contractual allowance at period end 
once an approval to bill medicare  medicaid and or third party payors has been obtained  the private pay balance is reversed and a corresponding medicare  medicaid or third party receivable amount is recorded 
the company s policy is to resolve accounts receivable with pending status as soon as practicable 
pending accounts receivable balances were not a significant component of the overall accounts receivable balance at december  omnicare has standard policies and procedures for collection of its accounts receivable 
the company s collection efforts generally include the mailing of statements  followed up when necessary with delinquency notices  personal and other contacts  the use of an in house national collections department or outside collection agencies  and potentially mediation arbitration or litigation when accounts are considered unresponsive 
omnicare s collection efforts primarily relate to its facility and private pay customers  as well as efforts to collect rework medicare part d copays and rejected claims 
when omnicare becomes aware that a specific customer is potentially unable to meet part or all of its financial obligations  for example  as a result of bankruptcy or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  the national credit and collections department includes the exposed balance in its allowance for doubtful accounts requirements 
at such time that a balance is definitively deemed to be uncollectible by omnicare management including the national credit and collections department  collections agencies and or outside legal counsel  the balance is manually written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december   the company does not have a significant portion of its overall accounts receivable balance placed in mediation arbitration  litigation or with outside collection agencies 
given the company s experience  management believes that the reserves for potential losses are adequate  but if any of the company s larger customers were to unexpectedly default on their obligations to omnicare  the company s overall allowances for doubtful accounts may prove to be inadequate 
in particular  if economic conditions worsen  the payor mix shifts significantly  or the company s customers reimbursement rates are adversely affected  impacting omnicare s customers ability to pay their bills  management may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly  and the company s accounts receivable collections  cash flows  financial position and results of operations would then be  potentially  adversely affected 
inventories the company maintains inventory at lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the basis of the first in  first out method 
there are not any significant obsolescence reserves recorded since the company has not historically experienced nor does it expect to experience significant levels of inventory obsolescence write offs 
physical inventories are typically performed on a monthly basis at all pharmacy sites  and in all cases the company s policy is to perform them at least once a quarter 
cost of goods sold is recorded based on the actual results of the physical inventory counts  and is estimated when a physical inventory is not performed in a particular month 
goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets be reviewed for impairment using a fair value based approach at least annually 
sfas requires the company to assess whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired  and requires goodwill to be tested between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its book carrying amount 
the company s assessments to date have indicated that goodwill has not been impaired 
the company s assessment of goodwill impairment is largely dependent on estimates of future cash flows at the aggregated reporting unit level  and a weighted average cost of capital 
the estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections with respect to future revenues and expenses believed to be reasonable and supportable at the time the annual impairment analysis is performed 
further  they require management s subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about overall growth rates and increases in expenses 
to the extent the book carrying value of the assets exceed their fair value  an impairment loss would be recorded 
changes in these estimates of future cash flows or weighted average cost of capital due to unforeseen events and circumstances could cause omnicare s analysis to indicate that goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods  and could result in the write off of a portion or all of the company s goodwill  which could be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  considering the results of its latest goodwill impairment review  particularly given the substantial margin by which estimated fair value exceeded the book carrying amounts of goodwill in its largest segment  pharmacy services  the company does not anticipate a material impact on the consolidated financial statements from differences in these assumptions in the near term  although there can be no assurances given in this regard 
insurance accruals omnicare is self insured for certain employee health insurance claims 
the company manages its health insurance risk by obtaining individual and aggregate stop loss coverage in the amount of  per claim and of expected aggregate claims  or approximately million for the year 
omnicare insures all of its property and casualty programs including worker s compensation and professional liability in excess of self insured retentions  or deductibles  on the various policies of insurance which range from between  and  per claim  depending on the type of coverage 
omnicare closely monitors and continually evaluates its historical claims experience  and obtains input from third party insurance and valuation professionals  to estimate the appropriate level of accrual for its self insured programs  including deductibles 
these accruals include provision for incurred  as well as incurred but not yet reported  claims 
in developing its self insurance accrual estimates  the company s liability calculation also considers the historical claim lag periods and current payment trends of insurance claims generally approximately months for health  and months for all other coverages 
a change in the historical claim lag period assumption by one month for health insurance claims would affect health insurance expense by approximately million pretax 
a change in the historical claim lag period by one month for property and casualty insurance claims would affect property and casualty insurance expense by approximately million pretax 
although significant fluctuations may occur in the short term due to unforeseen events potentially resulting in atypical claims experience  the company s historical claims experience  coupled with its stop loss coverages  has consistently supported management s assumption that this methodology provides for reasonable insurance expense estimates and accruals over a long term period 
employee benefit plans for certain of its employee benefit plans  the company utilizes estimates in developing its actuarial assumptions including such items as the expected rate of return on plan assets  discount rate  mortality rates  and the assumed rate of compensation increase  among other items  and relies on actuarial computations to estimate the future potential liability  expense and funding requirements associated with these benefits 
while it is required that the actuarial assumptions be reviewed each year as of the measurement date of december  the actuarial assumptions generally do not change between measurement dates 
during omnicare s annual review  generally near the beginning of the fiscal year  the company reviews and updates these assumptions  and considers historical experience  current market conditions and input from its third party advisors  including any changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
these actuarial assumptions and estimates attempt to anticipate future events  and if assessed differently or if they materially vary from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  could have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  a one percentage point change in any of the individual aforementioned assumptions used to calculate the company s pension obligation  holding all other assumptions constant  would not have a material impact on the company s consolidated operating results 
taxes the company estimates its current and deferred tax assets and liabilities  including those relating to recently acquired subsidiaries  based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as the realization of deferred tax assets including those relating to net operating losses 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
omnicare periodically reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence 
this evidence includes historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
projected future taxable income is based on the company s expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned 
the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and omnicare s tax methods of accounting 
the company also reviews its tax liabilities  including those relating to recently acquired subsidiaries  giving consideration to the relevant authoritative guidance  including sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  as well as sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  which requires an accrual for estimated losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
these estimates may change in the future  as actual results and any new information becomes known  and such changes could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income by jurisdiction  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  or if the tax laws change unfavorably  then the company could be required to increase its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets  resulting in an increase in the effective tax rate and related tax expense 
omnicare operates in a significant number of states and tax jurisdictions with varying tax laws 
the company is subject to both federal and state audits of tax returns in the normal course of business 
while the company believes it has provided adequately for tax liabilities in its consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by applicable taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on omnicare s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
if the provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate  if the company is unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably  the company could potentially experience tax losses 
likewise  if provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed  if the company is able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably  the company could experience potential tax gains 
a one percentage point change in the company s overall  and effective tax rates would impact tax expense and net income by million  million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas r  which replaced sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company accounted for stock incentive plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb  and related interpretations intrinsic value method 
historically  stock option awards have been granted with an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of company stock upon grant 
as a result  no stock based employee compensation cost for stock options was reflected in net income 
as further described in the recently issued accounting standards section of the description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  and stock based employee compensation  notes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  sfas r requires the company to record compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions in its financial statements 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award usually the vesting period 
the company currently uses the black scholes options pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on the grant date  which is affected by omnicare s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  as further discussed below 
these variables include omnicare s expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  actual and projected employee exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate and the stock s dividend yield 
the expected term of stock options granted represents the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding and is estimated based on historical stock option exercise experience 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company s stock over a period generally commensurate with the expected term of the stock options 
the risk free interest rate used in the option valuation model is based on united states treasury strip stripped coupon interest issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the stock options 
the expected dividend yield is based on the current omnicare stock yield 
the company is required to estimate forfeitures at the time of the grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods as necessary to reflect any changes in actual forfeiture experience 
omnicare uses historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and records stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock option awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting period 
considering the importance of each of the above assumptions in the calculation of fair value  the company re evaluates the estimate of these assumptions on a quarterly basis 
while the company believes its stock option fair value calculations are materially accurate  a one percentage point change in any of the individual aforementioned assumptions  holding all other assumptions constant  would not have a material impact on the fair value calculated by the company 
legal contingencies as part of its ongoing operations  the company is subject to various inspections  audits  inquiries and similar actions by third parties  as well as governmental regulatory authorities responsible for enforcing the laws and regulations to which the company is subject and including reviews of individual omnicare pharmacy s reimbursement documentation and administrative practices 
oftentimes  these inspections  audits and inquiries relate to prior periods  including periods predating omnicare s actual ownership of a particular acquired unit 
the company is also involved with various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
each quarter  the company reviews  including consultation with its outside legal advisors where applicable  the status of any inspections  audits  inquiries  legal claims and legal proceedings and assesses its potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any of these is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  the company accrues a liability for the estimated loss  in accordance with sfas to the extent the amount of a probable loss is estimable only by reference to a range of equally probable outcomes  and no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount  the low end of the range is accrued  as required by gaap 
because of inherent uncertainties related to these matters  the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and external factors beyond the company s control  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  omnicare reassesses the potential liability related to any pending inspections  audits  inquiries  claims and litigation and may revise its estimated exposure upward or downward accordingly 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position 
information pertaining to legal proceedings is further discussed at the commitments and contingencies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards information pertaining to recently issued accounting standards is further discussed at the recent issued accounting standards section of the description of business and summary of significant accounting policies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
outlook historically  the company has derived approximately one half of its revenues directly from government sources  and one half from the private sector including individual residents  third party insurers  long term care and other institutional health care facilities and its contract research organization business 
as part of ongoing operations  the company and its customers are subject to regulatory changes in the level of reimbursement received from the medicare and medicaid programs 
since  congress has passed a number of federal laws that have effected major changes in the healthcare system and payments to certain providers 
the balanced budget act of the bba mandated a prospective payment system pps for medicare eligible residents of skilled nursing facilities snfs 
prior to pps  snfs under medicare received cost based reimbursement 
under pps  medicare pays snfs a fixed fee per patient per day based upon the acuity level of the resident  covering substantially all items and services furnished during a medicare covered stay  including pharmacy services 
pps initially resulted in a significant reduction of reimbursement to snfs 
congress subsequently sought to restore some of the reductions in reimbursement resulting from pps 
one provision gave snfs a temporary rate increase for certain specific high acuity patients beginning april   and ending when the centers for medicare medicaid services cms implemented a refined patient classification system under pps 
for several years  cms did not implement such refinements  thus continuing the additional rate increase for certain high acuity patients through federal fiscal year in the final snf pps rule for fiscal year  cms added nine patient classification categories to the pps patient classification system  thus triggering the expiration of the high acuity payments add ons 
however  cms estimated that the rule would have a slightly positive financial impact on snfs in fiscal year because the billion reduction from the expiration of the add on payments would be more than offset by a million increase in the nursing case mix weight for all of the rug categories and a million increase associated with various updates to the payment rates including updates to the wage and market basket indexes  resulting in a million overall increase in payments for fiscal year the new patient classification refinements became effective on january   and the market basket increase became effective october  on july   cms issued the update to the snf pps rates for fiscal year effective october   snfs receive the full percent market basket increase to rates  increasing payments to snfs by approximately million for fiscal year while the fiscal year snf pps rates do not decrease payments to snfs  the loss of revenues associated with future changes in snf payments could  in the future  have an adverse effect on the financial condition of the company s snf clients which could  in turn  adversely affect the timing or level of their payments to omnicare 
moreover  on february   the president signed into law the deficit reduction act dra  which will reduce net medicare and medicaid spending by approximately billion over five years 
among other things  the legislation reduces medicare snf bad debt payments by percent for those individuals who are not dually eligible for medicare and medicaid 
this provision is expected to reduce payments to snfs by million over years fiscal years 
further  on february   the bush administration released its fiscal year budget proposal  which includes legislative and administrative proposals that would reduce medicare spending by approximately billion in fiscal year and billion over years 
among other things  the budget would provide no annual update for snfs in and a percent adjustment to the update annually thereafter 
the budget also would move toward site neutral post hospital payments to limit perceived inappropriate incentives for five conditions commonly treated in both snfs and inpatient rehabilitation facilities 
the budget proposal also would eliminate all bad debt reimbursements for unpaid beneficiary cost sharing over four years 
most of these proposals would require congressional action 
moreover  congress could adopt additional legislation in the future that would further restrict medicare funding for snfs 
in december  congress enacted the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of mma  which includes a major expansion of the medicare prescription drug benefit under a new medicare part d  effective january  prior to enrollment in part d  medicare beneficiaries were able to receive assistance with their outpatient prescription drug costs through a prescription drug discount card program 
this discount card program began in june  and provided enrollees access to negotiated discounted prices for prescription drugs 
the discount card program ended may  under the new prescription drug benefit  medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities or in a fallback plan offered on behalf of the government through a contractor  to the extent private entities fail to offer a plan in a given area  which provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs collectively  part d plans 
part d plans include both plans providing the drug benefit on a stand alone basis and medicare advantage plans providing drug coverage as a supplement to an existing medical benefit under that medicare advantage plan  most commonly a health maintenance organization plan 
medicare beneficiaries generally have to pay a premium to enroll in a part d plan  with the premium amount varying from plan to plan  although cms provides various federal subsidies to part d plans to reduce the cost to beneficiaries 
medicare beneficiaries who are also entitled to benefits under a state medicaid program so called dual eligibles now have their prescription drug costs covered by the new medicare drug benefit  including the nursing home residents omnicare serves  whose drug costs were previously covered by state medicaid programs 
in  approximately of omnicare s revenue was derived from beneficiaries covered under the federal medicare part d program 
cms provides premium and cost sharing subsidies to part d plans with respect to dual eligible residents of nursing homes 
such dual eligibles are not required to pay a premium for enrollment in a part d plan  so long as the premium for the part d plan in which they are enrolled is at or below the premium subsidy  nor are they required to meet deductibles or pay copayment amounts 
further  all dual eligibles who had not affirmatively enrolled in a part d plan as of december  were automatically enrolled into a prescription drug plan pdp by cms on a random basis from among those pdps meeting cms criteria for low income premiums in the pdp region 
as is the case for any nursing home beneficiary  such dual eligible beneficiaries may select a different part d plan at any time through the part d enrollment process 
in sum  dual eligible residents of nursing homes are entitled to have their prescription drug costs covered by a part d plan  provided that the prescription drugs which they are taking are either on the part d plan s formulary  or an exception to the plan s formulary is granted 
cms requires the formularies of part d plans to include the types of drugs most commonly needed by medicare beneficiaries and an exceptions process to provide coverage for medically necessary drugs 
pursuant to the part d final rule  effective january   the company obtains reimbursement for drugs it provides to enrollees of a given part d plan in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated between it and that part d plan 
the company has entered into such agreements with nearly all part d plan sponsors under which it will provide drugs and associated services to their enrollees 
the company continues to have ongoing discussions with part d plans in the ordinary course and may  as appropriate  renegotiate agreements 
moreover  as expected in the transition to a new program of this magnitude  certain administrative and payment issues have arisen  resulting in higher operating expenses  as well as outstanding net receivables for copays and rejected claims of approximately million and million  respectively  at december  until these administrative and payment issues have been resolved  the company will not be able to determine fully the impact of the new part d drug benefit on its results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the mma does not change the manner in which medicare pays for drugs for medicare beneficiaries covered under a medicare part a stay 
the company continues to receive reimbursement for drugs provided to such residents from the snfs  in accordance with the terms of the agreements it has negotiated with each snf 
the company also continues to receive reimbursement from the state medicaid programs  albeit to a greatly reduced extent  for those medicaid beneficiaries not eligible for the part d program  including those under age  and for certain drugs specifically excluded from medicare part d 
cms has issued subregulatory guidance on many aspects of the final part d rule including the provision of pharmaceutical services to long term care residents 
cms has also expressed some concerns about pharmacies receipt of discounts  rebates and other price concessions from drug manufacturers 
specifically  in a finalized call letter for the calendar year  cms indicated that for  cms is requiring part d sponsors to have policies and systems in place  as part of their drug utilization management programs  to protect beneficiaries and reduce costs when long term care pharmacies are subject to incentives to move market share through access performance rebates from drug manufacturers 
for the purposes of managing and monitoring drug utilization  especially where such rebates exist  cms instructs part d plan sponsors to require pharmacies to disclose to the part d plan sponsor any discounts  rebates and other direct or indirect remuneration designed to directly or indirectly influence or impact utilization of part d drugs 
cms stated that plan sponsors should provide assurances that such information will remain confidential 
cms has recently issued subregulatory guidelines specifying the information that cms is requiring from plan sponsors with respect to rebates paid to long term care pharmacies 
cms has also issued draft reporting requirements for which would  among other things  require disclosure of non rebate discounts and price concessions provided to long term care pharmacies 
cms is accepting comments on this draft until april  the company intends to negotiate with plan sponsors with respect to the terms and conditions under which information would be provided 
cms has indicated it will continue to issue guidance on the part d program as it is implemented 
the company is continuing to monitor implementation of the new part d benefit  and until further agency guidance is known and until the administrative and payment issues associated with the transition to this massive program have been resolved  the company cannot predict the ultimate effect of the final rule or the outcome of other potential developments relating to its implementation on our business  results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
other healthcare funding issues remain  including pressures on federal and state medicaid budgets  and most states are taking steps to implement cost controls within their medicaid programs 
for example  the dra includes several changes to the medicaid program designed to rein in program spending 
these include  among others  strengthening the medicaid asset transfer restrictions for persons seeking to qualify for medicaid long term care coverage  which could  due to the timing of the penalty period  increase facilities exposure to uncompensated care 
this provision is expected to reduce medicaid spending by an estimated billion over years 
the law also gives states greater flexibility to expand access to home and community based services by allowing states to provide these services as an optional benefit without undergoing the waiver approval process  and includes a new demonstration to encourage states to provide long term care services in a community setting to individuals who currently receive medicaid services in nursing homes 
together these provisions could increase state funding for home and community based services  while prompting states to cut funding for nursing facilities 
the dra also changed the so called medicaid upper limit rules for multiple source prescription drugs 
like the current upper limit  it only applies to drug ingredient costs and does not include dispensing fees  which will continue to be determined by the states 
first  the dra redefined a multiple source drug to be a covered outpatient drug that has at least one other drug product that is therapeutically equivalent 
thus  the federal upper limit is triggered when a multiple source drug has two or more therapeutic equivalents  instead of three or more as was previously the case 
second  effective january   the dra changed the federal upper payment limit from percent of the lowest published price for a drug which is usually the average wholesale price to percent of the lowest average manufacturer price amp 
further  on december   cms issued a proposed rule to implement the dra provisions 
among other things  the proposed rule would establish a new federal upper limit calculation for multiple source drugs that is based on percent of the lowest amp in a drug class  promote transparency in drug pricing by requiring cms to post amp amounts on its web site  and establish a uniform definition for amp which also could impact manufacturer drug rebate payments 
these dra provisions are expected to reduce federal and state medicaid spending by billion over five years 
the dra requires a final medicaid drug payment regulation to be issued by july  with the advent of medicare part d  the company s revenues from state medicaid programs are substantially lower than has been the case previously 
however  some of the company s agreements with part d plans and other payors have incorporated the medicaid upper limit rules into the pricing mechanisms for prescription drugs 
until the final medicaid drug payment regulation is issued  the company cannot predict the impact of the revised rule on its business 
there can be no assurance  however  that the changes under the dra will not have an adverse impact on its business 
changes in medicaid policy in terms of provider taxes that help to finance payments to nursing facilities and payments to government owned facilities could reduce payments to nursing facilities 
moreover  president bush s fiscal year budget proposal includes a series of proposals impacting medicaid  including legislative and administrative changes that would reduce medicaid payments by almost billion over five years 
among other things  the proposed budget would further reduce the federal upper limit reimbursement for multiple source drugs to percent of the amp of the lowest priced drug in the group  and allow states to use private sector formulary management techniques to leverage greater discounts through negotiations with drug manufacturers 
while the company has endeavored to adjust to these types of funding pressures in the past  there can be no assurance that these or future changes in medicaid payments to nursing facilities  pharmacies  or managed care systems  or their potential impact on payments under agreements with part d plans  will not have an adverse impact on its business 
on october   the plaintiffs in new england carpenters health benefits fund et al 
v 
first databank  inc and mckesson corporation  ca no 
cv pbs united district court for the district of massachusetts and defendant first databank  inc first databank entered into a settlement agreement relating to first databank s publication of average wholesale price awp 
awp is a pricing benchmark that is widely used to calculate a portion of the reimbursement payable to pharmacy providers for the drugs and biologicals they provide  including under state medicaid programs  medicare part d plans and certain of the company s contracts with long term care facilities 
the settlement agreement would require first databank to cease publishing awp two years after the settlement becomes effective unless a competitor of first databank is then publishing awp  and would require that first databank modify the manner in which it calculates awp until first databank ceases publishing this price data 
although the settlement agreement is still subject to final approval of the court  the company is evaluating the potential impact of the settlement in the context of certain of the contracts that it has with various payors and the actions that may be taken  if necessary  to offset or otherwise mitigate such impact 
in addition  the government and private health insurance programs could discontinue or modify the use of awp or otherwise implement payment methods that reduce the reimbursement for drugs and biologicals 
there can be no assurance  however  that the first databank settlement  if approved  or actions  if any  by the government or private health insurance programs relating to awp would not have an adverse impact on the company s reimbursement for drugs and biologicals and have implications for the use of awp as a benchmark from which pricing in the pharmaceutical industry is negotiated  which could adversely affect the company 
longer term  funding for federal and state healthcare programs must consider the aging of the population and the growth in enrollees as eligibility is expanded  the escalation in drug costs owing to higher drug utilization among seniors and the introduction of new  more efficacious but also more expensive medications  the increasing availability and utilization of generic drugs  and the long term financing of the medicare and medicaid programs 
given competing national priorities  it remains difficult to predict the outcome and impact on the company of any changes in healthcare policy relating to the future funding of the medicare and medicaid programs 
demographic trends indicate that demand for long term care will increase well into the middle of this century as the elderly population grows significantly 
moreover  those over consume a disproportionately high level of healthcare services  including prescription drugs  when compared with the under population 
there is widespread consensus that appropriate pharmaceutical care is generally considered the most cost effective form of treatment for the chronic ailments afflicting the elderly and also one that is able to improve the quality of life 
further  the pace and quality of new drug development is yielding many promising new drugs targeted at the diseases of the elderly 
these new drugs may be more expensive than older  less effective drug therapies due to rising research costs 
however  they are significantly more effective in curing or ameliorating illness and in lowering overall healthcare costs by reducing  among other things  hospitalizations  physician visits  nursing time and lab tests 
these trends not only support long term growth for the geriatric pharmaceutical industry but also containment of healthcare costs and the well being of the nation s growing elderly population 
in order to fund this growing demand  the company anticipates that the government and the private sector will continue to review  assess and possibly alter healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies 
while it cannot at this time predict the effect of the new medicare part d drug benefit or any further initiatives on omnicare s business  management believes that the company s expertise in geriatric pharmaceutical care and pharmaceutical cost management position omnicare to help meet the challenges of today s healthcare environment 
further  while volatility can occur from time to time in the contract research business owing to factors such as the success or failure of its clients compounds  the timing or budgetary constraints of its clients  or consolidation within our client base  new drug discovery remains an important priority of drug manufacturers 
drug manufacturers  in order to optimize their research and development efforts  will continue to turn to contract research organizations to assist them in accelerating drug research development and commercialization
