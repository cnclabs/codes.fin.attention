item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  develop  produce and market innovative products  systems and services for advanced communications solutions 
we believe many of our solutions play a vital role in providing or enhancing communication capabilities when terrestrial communications infrastructure is unavailable or ineffective 
we conduct our business through three complementary segments telecommunications transmission  mobile data communications and rf microwave amplifiers 
we sell our products to a diverse customer base in the global commercial and government communications markets 
we believe we are a leader in the market segments that we serve 
our telecommunications transmission segment  which is currently our largest business segment  provides sophisticated equipment and systems that are used to enhance satellite transmission efficiency and that enable wireless communications in environments where terrestrial communications are unavailable  inefficient or too expensive 
our mobile data communications segment  currently our fastest growing segment  provides customers with an integrated solution  including mobile satellite transceivers and satellite network support  to enable global satellite based communications when mobile  real time  secure transmission is required for applications including logistics  support and battlefield command and control 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment designs  manufactures and markets solid state  high power  broadband rf microwave amplifier products 
a substantial portion of our sales may be derived from a limited number of relatively large customer contracts  such as our movement tracking system mts contract with the us army and our us army s force xxi battle command  brigade and below command and control systems also known as blue force tracking bft contract  for which the timing of revenues cannot be predicted 
quarterly and period to period sales and operating results may be significantly affected by one or more of such contracts 
in addition  our gross profit is affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of products  systems and services sold  production efficiencies  estimates of warranty expense  price competition and general economic conditions 
our gross profit may also be affected by the impact of any cumulative adjustments to contracts that are accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
our contracts with the us government can be terminated at any time and orders are subject to unpredictable funding  deployment and technology decisions by the us government 
some of these contracts  such as the mts and bft contracts  are indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts  and as such  the us army is not obligated to purchase any equipment or services under the contracts 
accordingly  we can experience significant fluctuations in sales and operating results from quarter to quarter and period to period comparisons may not be indicative of a trend or future performance 
revenue from the sale of our products is generally recognized when the earnings process is complete  upon shipment or customer acceptance 
revenue from contracts relating to the design  development or manufacture of complex electronic equipment to a buyer s specification or to provide services relating to the performance of such contracts is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method 
revenue from contracts that contain multiple elements that are not accounted for under the percentage of completion method are generally accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue from these contracts is allocated to each respective element based on each element s relative fair value and is recognized when the respective revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
recent acquisitions in february  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of tolt technologies  inc tolt for an aggregate purchase price of million  including transaction costs of million 
in fiscal  we significantly de emphasized stand alone sales of tolt s turnkey employee mobility solutions  and are focusing our efforts on selling commercial satellite based mobile data applications 
this operation was combined with our existing business in and is part of our mobile data communications segment 
in august  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of insite consulting  inc insite  a logistics application software company  for million  including transaction costs of million 
insite has developed the geoops enterprise location monitoring system  a software based solution that allows customers to integrate legacy data systems with near real time logistics and operational data systems 
this operation was combined with our existing business and is part of our mobile data communications segment 
in february  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of digicast networks  inc digicast  a manufacturer of digital video broadcasting equipment  for million 
this operation was combined with our existing business and is part of the telecommunications transmission segment 
critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies to be critical due to the estimation process involved in each 
revenue recognition on long term contracts 
revenues and related costs from long term contracts relating to the design  development or manufacture of complex electronic equipment to a buyer s specification or to provide services relating to the performance of such contracts are recognized in accordance with aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
we primarily apply the percentage of completion method and generally recognize revenue based on the relationship of total costs incurred to total projected costs  or  alternatively  based on output measures  such as units delivered 
profits expected to be realized on such contracts are based on total estimated sales for the contract compared to total estimated costs  including warranty costs  at completion of the contract 
these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts  and adjustments to profits resulting from such revisions are made cumulative to the date of the change 
estimated losses on long term contracts are recorded in the period in which the losses become evident 
long term us government cost reimbursable type contracts are also specifically covered by accounting research bulletin no 
government contracts  cost plus fixed fee contracts arb  in addition to sop we have been engaged in the production and delivery of goods and services on a continual basis under contractual arrangements for many years 
historically  we have demonstrated an ability to accurately estimate revenues and expenses relating to our long term contracts 
however  there exist inherent risks and uncertainties in estimating revenues  expenses and progress toward completion  particularly on larger or longer term contracts 
if we do not accurately estimate the total sales  related costs and progress towards completion on such contracts  the estimated gross margins may be significantly impacted or losses may need to be recognized in future periods 
any such resulting changes in margins or contract losses could be material to our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  most government contracts have termination for convenience clauses that provide the customer with the right to terminate the contract at any time 
such terminations could impact the assumptions regarding total contract revenues and expenses utilized in recognizing profit under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
changes to these assumptions could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
historically  we have not experienced material terminations of our long term contracts 
we also address customer acceptance provisions in assessing our ability to perform our contractual obligations under long term contracts 
our inability to perform on our long term contracts could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 
historically  we have been able to perform on our long term contracts 
accounting for stock based compensation 
as discussed further in notes to consolidated financial statements note j accounting for stock based compensation  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r on august  using the modified prospective method 
through july   we accounted for our stock option and employee stock purchase plans under the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 and as a result no compensation costs had been recognized in our historical consolidated statements of operations 
we have used and expect to continue to use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of stock based awards 
the black scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected option term and risk free interest rates 
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of stock based awards reflect our best estimates  but involve uncertainties relating to market and other conditions  many of which are outside of our control 
we estimate expected volatility by considering the historical volatility of our stock  the implied volatility of publicly traded stock options in our stock and our expectations of volatility for the expected term of stock based compensation awards 
as a result  if other assumptions or estimates had been used for options granted  stock based compensation expense that was recorded could have been materially different 
furthermore  if different assumptions are used in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
as of july   our company s goodwill and other intangible assets aggregated million 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles  we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
any such resulting impairment charges could be material to our results of operations 
provision for warranty obligations 
we provide warranty coverage for most of our products  including products under long term contracts  for a period of at least one year from the date of shipment 
we record a liability for estimated warranty expense based on historical claims  product failure rates and other factors 
some of our warranties are provided under long term contracts  the costs of which are incorporated into our estimates of total contract costs 
there exist inherent risks and uncertainties in estimating warranty expenses  particularly on larger or longer term contracts 
as such  if we do not accurately estimate our warranty costs  any changes to our original estimates could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
accounting for income taxes 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the tax jurisdictions where we operate  permanent differences between financial reporting and tax reporting and available credits and incentives 
the us federal government is our most significant income tax jurisdiction 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and tax positions 
we may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authority and positions taken by us may not be sustained 
we provide tax reserves for tax exposures relating to periods subject to audit 
the development of reserves for these exposures requires consideration of timing and judgments about tax issues and potential outcomes  and is a subjective critical estimate 
in certain circumstances  the ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involves significant uncertainties 
it is our policy to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates  they could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
as discussed in notes to consolidated financial statements note h income taxes and note income taxes  on august  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
we record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends 
other factors may also influence our provision  including decisions to exit a product line  technological change and new product development 
these factors could result in a change in the amount of excess and obsolete inventory on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if we determine that our inventory was overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination 
any such charges could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customers current credit information 
generally  we will require cash in advance or payment secured by irrevocable letters of credit before an order is accepted from an international customer that we do not do business with regularly 
in addition  we seek to obtain insurance for certain international customers 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and the financial health of specific customers 
changes to the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of our consolidated net sales fiscal years ended july  net sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses amortization of intangibles operating income interest expense income  net income before provision for income taxes net income comparison of fiscal and net sales 
consolidated net sales were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in net sales reflects growth in our telecommunications transmission and mobile data communications segments  partially offset by lower net sales in our rf microwave amplifiers segment 
net sales in our telecommunications transmission segment were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  an increase of million  or 
the increase in net sales in this segment primarily reflects increased sales of our over the horizon microwave systems and satellite earth station products 
sales of our over the horizon microwave systems for fiscal were higher than fiscal due to deliveries of our new mbps troposcatter modem upgrade kits for use on the us department of defense s dod an trc digital troposcatter terminals 
on the other hand  sales of our over the horizon microwave systems  both direct and indirect  to our north african country end customer were lower during fiscal as we believe the end customer is between major phases of a multi year roll out of a large project 
net sales in fiscal include sales of million relating to a gross profit adjustment  as discussed below  on a large over the horizon microwave system contract 
sales of satellite earth station products in fiscal were higher than fiscal as we continued to benefit from demand for our bandwidth efficient satellite earth station modems  including those used to support cellular backhaul applications 
our telecommunications transmission segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal although sales in our telecommunications transmission segment can fluctuate from period to period based on the strength of our satellite earth station bookings and the receipt of and performance on large over the horizon microwave system contracts  we currently believe that net sales in our telecommunications transmission segment should increase in fiscal we believe that the demand drivers for our satellite earth station products remain strong and that we will receive at least one large over the horizon microwave system contract in fiscal net sales in our mobile data communications segment were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  an increase of million  or 
the increase in net sales was due to an increase in deliveries to the us army and army national guard for ongoing support of mts program activities and higher sales of battlefield command and control applications to the us military 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in net sales of million related to the impact of our decision  made in fiscal  to significantly de emphasize stand alone sales of low margin turnkey employee mobility solutions 
net sales in fiscal and include sales of million and million  respectively  relating to gross profit adjustments on our original mts contract  discussed below 
our mobile data communications segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal our original and subsequently extended million mts contract expired in august we ultimately received total orders against the original mts contract of million 
in august  we were awarded a new idiq contract  with a ceiling value of million  to continue to provide and support mts products and services through july  in addition to our new mts contract  we were also awarded a separate idiq contract to continue to provide our mobile data communication products and services in support of the us army s bft tracking system 
this contract has a ceiling value of million and continues through december  although it is difficult to predict the timing and amount of funding that we expect to ultimately receive on our new mts and bft contracts  we currently anticipate that our mobile data communications segment will experience continued growth in fiscal sales and profitability in our mobile data communications segment can fluctuate dramatically from period to period due to many factors including unpredictable funding  deployment and technology decisions by the us government 
also  we are aware that the us government has experienced delays in the receipt of certain components that are provided to us for incorporation into our mobile satellite transceivers 
if we do not receive these us government furnished components in a timely manner  we could experience delays in fulfilling funded and anticipated orders from our customers 
net sales in our rf microwave amplifiers segment were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in net sales was due to lower sales of our amplifiers that are incorporated into improvised explosive device jamming systems  as well as certain orders currently in backlog that are now expected to ship in fiscal a portion of our backlog is comprised of more complex amplifiers employing newer technology which has resulted in longer than expected production times to ensure that these amplifiers meet our customers specifications 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal based on the amount of our current backlog and anticipated future orders  we currently expect sales in our rf microwave amplifiers segment to increase in fiscal in the second half of fiscal  we were selected by one of our customers to participate in the counter remote controlled improvised explosive device electronic warfare crew program and we expect to receive additional orders for these types of amplifiers in fiscal international sales which include sales to us companies for inclusion in products which are sold to international customers represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
domestic commercial sales represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
sales to the us government including sales to prime contractors to the us government represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal and  one customer  a prime contractor  represented and of consolidated net sales  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales discussed above  as well as an increase in the gross profit percentage to for fiscal from for as discussed further below  we recorded favorable cumulative adjustments relating to certain long term contracts  which were partially offset by a firmware related warranty provision in both periods 
excluding the impact of these adjustments and the firmware related warranty provision  to both net sales and gross profit  our gross profit as a percentage of sales for fiscal and would have been and  respectively 
the increase in the adjusted gross profit percentage was primarily due to increased gross margins within our telecommunications transmission segment  primarily due to the benefit of higher sales of our new mbps troposcatter modem upgrade kits  and increased operating efficiencies in our mobile data communications segment  including the benefit of our decision to significantly de emphasize stand alone sales of low margin turnkey employee mobility solutions 
the increase in gross margins was offset  in part  by lower gross margins in our rf microwave amplifiers segment primarily due to lower sales and product mix 
during fiscal and  we recorded favorable cumulative gross profit adjustments of million of which million related to the mobile data communications segment and million related to the telecommunications transmission segment and million of which million related to the mobile data communications segment and million related to the rf microwave amplifiers segment  respectively  relating to our ongoing review of total estimated contract revenues and costs  and the related gross margin at completion  on long term contracts 
offsetting these adjustments  in our mobile data communications segment and included in cost of sales for fiscal and  is a firmware related warranty provision of million and million  respectively 
the favorable cumulative gross profit adjustments recorded in both periods in our mobile data communications segment resulted from the increase in the estimated gross profit at completion on our original mts contract 
the adjustments are primarily related to increased operating efficiencies and  as it relates to fiscal  the finalization of our total contract costs including estimates for warranty obligations relating to the completion of the original mts contract 
the favorable cumulative gross profit adjustment recorded in our telecommunications transmission segment during fiscal related to an increase in the estimated gross profit at completion on a large over the horizon microwave system contract 
the favorable cumulative gross profit adjustment recorded in our rf microwave amplifiers segment during fiscal related to a us military contract that was substantially completed in fiscal included in cost of sales for fiscal and are provisions for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million  respectively 
as discussed in our critical accounting policies provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  we regularly review our inventory and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and projected usage assumptions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to higher payroll related expenses including amortization of stock based compensation and increased other costs associated with the growth of our business 
this increase was offset  in part  by lower expenses in our mobile data communications segment as we continue to de emphasize stand alone sales of low margin turnkey employee mobility solutions 
as a percentage of consolidated net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
amortization of stock based compensation expense recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
approximately million and million of such amounts  respectively  related to our telecommunications transmission segment  with the remaining expenses primarily related to our mobile data communications segment and  to a lesser extent  our rf microwave amplifiers segment 
as a percentage of consolidated net sales  research and development expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
as an investment for the future  we are continually enhancing our existing products and developing new products and technologies 
whenever possible  we seek customer funding for research and development to adapt our products to specialized customer requirements 
during fiscal and  customers reimbursed us million and million  respectively  which is not reflected in the reported research and development expenses  but is included in net sales with the related costs included in cost of sales 
amortization of stock based compensation expense recorded as research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the amortization primarily relates to intangibles with finite lives that we acquired in connection with various acquisitions including the acquisitions of insite and digicast that occurred in fiscal 
operating income 
operating income for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the million  or increase  was primarily the result of the higher sales and gross profit  discussed above 
operating income in our telecommunications transmission segment increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  as a result of increased net sales and gross profit  partially offset by increased operating expenses 
in addition  as discussed above under gross profit  included in operating income for fiscal is a cumulative adjustment related to a large over the horizon microwave systems contract which favorably impacted operating income by million 
our mobile data communications segment generated operating income of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in net sales and operating efficiencies achieved  including the benefit of lower selling  general and administrative expenses as we continue to de emphasize stand alone sales of low margin turnkey employee mobility solutions 
in addition  as discussed above under gross profit  included in operating income for fiscal and  are positive impacts from the cumulative adjustments  net of the respective firmware related warranty provisions  of million and million  respectively 
operating income in our rf microwave amplifiers segment decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due primarily to lower net sales and lower gross margins 
in addition  as discussed above under gross profit  included in operating income for fiscal is a cumulative adjustment which favorably impacted operating income by million 
unallocated operating expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due primarily to higher payroll related expenses including increased amortization of stock based compensation  as well as increased other costs associated with growing our business 
amortization of stock based compensation expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in both the number and related fair value of stock based awards that are being amortized over their respective service periods for fiscal as compared to fiscal amortization of stock based compensation is expected to increase in fiscal as a result of ongoing amortization of awards currently outstanding including those issued through september  
interest expense 
interest expense was million for both fiscal and interest expense primarily relates to our convertible senior notes 
interest income and other 
interest income and other for fiscal was million  as compared to million for fiscal the million increase was primarily due to an increase in interest rates and additional investable cash since july provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the passage of legislation  in fiscal  extending the federal research and experimentation credit  including million of tax benefits related to the retroactive application of the credit to fiscal  and the approval by our stockholders of an amendment to the stock incentive plan the plan which will permit us to claim tax deductions for cash incentive awards anticipated to be paid under the plan without limitation under m of the internal revenue code 
in addition  we also recorded incremental tax benefits aggregating million during fiscal including a million tax benefit due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations 
our tax rate for fiscal was favorably impacted by the recording of a net benefit of million primarily relating to the favorable settlement of a state tax matter 
excluding adjustments  our effective tax rate for fiscal approximated 
we currently expect that our fiscal effective tax rate will be approximately 
the expected increase in the effective tax rate from the experienced in fiscal is primarily the result of i the items impacting the tax rate discussed above  ii the expiration  in december  of the federal research and experimentation credit  iii the repeal  in december  of the extraterritorial income exclusion  offset by iv the scheduled phase in of the deduction for domestic production activities 
our federal income tax return for the fiscal year ended july  is currently being audited by the internal revenue service 
additional income tax returns for other fiscal years may also be examined 
if the outcome of the audit differs materially from our original income tax provisions  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
comparison of fiscal and net sales 
consolidated net sales were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in net sales was driven by an increase in our telecommunications transmission and our mobile data communications segments  partially offset by lower net sales in our rf microwave amplifiers segment 
net sales in our telecommunications transmission segment were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  an increase of million  or 
the growth in this segment resulted primarily from an increase in demand for our satellite earth station products and sales related to a contract with a third party commercial customer to outsource its manufacturing 
fiscal also includes a million cumulative adjustment to net sales which resulted from lower than anticipated costs on two large over the horizon microwave system contracts 
sales in the over the horizon microwave systems product line can fluctuate dramatically from period to period based on the receipt of large contracts and our performance thereon 
our telecommunications transmission segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal net sales in our mobile data communications segment were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  an increase of million  or 
the increase in net sales was due to i higher sales on the mts contract  including million of sales relating to the gross profit adjustment discussed below under gross profit  ii higher sales of battlefield command and control applications to the us military  and iii our acquisition of tolt in february which contributed million of net sales for fiscal compared to million of net sales for fiscal in the second half of fiscal  we significantly de emphasized stand alone sales of tolt s low margin turnkey employee mobility solutions to further focus its sales efforts on commercial satellite based mobile data applications 
stand alone sales of these low margin turnkey employee mobility solutions during fiscal were approximately million 
net sales for fiscal were positively impacted by a favorable cumulative adjustment associated with the change from the usage method to the straight line method of accounting for mts prepaid service time revenue  which contributed million to net sales 
period to period sales and profitability in our mobile data communications segment can fluctuate dramatically due to funding fluctuations 
our mobile data communications segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal net sales in our rf microwave amplifiers segment were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in net sales was due primarily to lower sales of our amplifiers that are incorporated into improvised explosive device jamming systems  partially offset by increased demand for other defense related products in this segment 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal international sales which include sales to us companies for inclusion in products which are sold to international customers represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
domestic commercial sales represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
sales to the us government including sales to prime contractors to the us government represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively

gross profit 
gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
our gross profit percentage was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal excluding the impact of adjustments to both net sales and gross profit in both periods  as discussed below  our adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal and would have been and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily due to a higher proportion of our consolidated net sales being in the mobile data communications segment  which typically realizes lower gross margins than sales in our other two segments 
in addition  fiscal includes higher sales relating to tolt s turnkey employee mobility solutions  which have lower gross margins than any of our other product lines 
the decline in gross margin percentage due to the change in product mix was partially offset by continued increased operating efficiencies associated with increased usage of our high volume technology manufacturing facility during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded favorable cumulative gross profit adjustments of million of which million relates to the mobile data communications segment and million relates to the rf microwave amplifiers segment 
the adjustment in our mobile data communications segment was primarily the result of increased mts funding from the us army  as well as improved operating efficiencies 
the adjustment in our rf microwave amplifiers segment related to a military contract that was substantially completed in fiscal these favorable adjustments were partially offset by a million warranty provision in our mobile data communications segment relating to certain of our firmware that had to be modified 
during fiscal  we recorded cumulative adjustments related to two large over the horizon microwave system contracts and the mts contract with an aggregate impact of million on gross profit of which million relates to the mobile data communications segment and million relates to the telecommunications transmission segment

selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to i the increased level of net sales and activity in our telecommunications transmission and mobile data communications segments  ii the recording of million of stock based compensation expense during fiscal  and iii a full year of expenses associated with tolt  which was acquired in february there was no stock based compensation expense included in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal as a percentage of consolidated net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
approximately million and million of such amounts  respectively  related to our telecommunications transmission segment  with the remaining expenses primarily related to our mobile data communications segment and  to a lesser extent  our rf microwave amplifiers segment 
in addition  during fiscal  we recorded million of stock based compensation expense in research and development expenses 
there was no stock based compensation expense included in research and development expenses in fiscal as an investment for the future  we are continually enhancing our existing products and developing new products and technologies 
whenever possible  we seek customer funding for research and development to adapt our products to specialized customer requirements 
during fiscal and  customers reimbursed us million and million  respectively  which is not reflected in the reported research and development expenses  but is included in net sales with the related costs included in cost of sales 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the amortization primarily relates to intangibles with finite lives that we acquired in connection with various acquisitions 
operating income 
operating income for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the million  or increase  was the result of the higher sales and gross profit  discussed above  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
operating income in our telecommunications transmission segment increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  as a result of increased net sales and gross profit  partially offset by increased operating expenses 
in addition  fiscal included a million positive impact on operating income from the cumulative gross margin adjustments discussed above under gross profit related to two large over the horizon microwave system contracts 
our mobile data communications segment generated operating income of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due primarily to the significant increase in net sales and gross profit  partially offset by increased operating expenses  including increased research and development expenses 
the operations relating to tolt  which incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal  have been combined into our network operations center facility 
in addition  fiscal and included positive impacts on operating income from the cumulative gross margin adjustments  net of the warranty provision in the fiscal period  discussed above under gross profit of million and million  respectively 
operating income in our rf microwave amplifiers segment increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal operating income for fiscal includes a million benefit from a positive gross margin adjustment on a contract discussed above under gross profit 
unallocated operating expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due primarily to the recording of million of stock based compensation expense associated with sfas no 
r and increased incentive compensation costs in connection with the significant increase in pre tax income 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for both fiscal and interest expense primarily relates to our convertible senior notes issued in january interest income 
interest income for fiscal was million  as compared to million for fiscal the million increase was due primarily to an increase in interest rates and additional investable cash  primarily provided by our operating cash flow 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to i the increased level of pre tax profit  ii the nondeductibility of stock based compensation expense in fiscal relating to incentive stock options  iii the expiration  in december  of the federal research and experimentation credit  and iv the scheduled phase out of the extraterritorial income exclusion which was slightly offset by the scheduled phase in of the deduction for domestic production activities 
in fiscal  we recorded a net tax benefit of million primarily relating to the favorable settlement of a state tax matter 
in fiscal  we recorded a million tax benefit related to the reduction in the valuation allowance that was established for the extended write off period of acquired in process research and development 
liquidity and capital resources our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents increased to million at july  from million at july   representing an increase of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to increased net income  depreciation  amortization including the amortization of stock based compensation and advanced payments received from customers offset by net changes in other working capital accounts 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million  of which million was for purchases of property  plant and equipment including expenditures related to the continued expansion of our high volume technology manufacturing center located in tempe  arizona  and continued enhancements to our network operations facility in germantown  maryland 
in fiscal we paid million relating to our acquisitions of insite and digicast 
we currently expect capital expenditures for fiscal to be between million and million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal  primarily due to the exercises of stock based awards  including the related income tax benefit 
financing arrangement on january   we issued million of our convertible senior notes in a private offering pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
for further information concerning this financing  see notes to consolidated financial statements note convertible senior notes due commitments in the normal course of business  we routinely enter into binding and non binding purchase obligations primarily covering anticipated purchases of inventory and equipment 
we do not expect that these commitments as of july  will materially adversely affect our liquidity 
at july   we had contractual cash obligations to repay our convertible senior notes  capital lease and operating lease obligations including satellite lease expenditures relating to our mobile data communications segment contracts and the financing of a purchase of proprietary technology 
payments due under these long term obligations  excluding interest on the convertible senior notes  are as follows obligations due by fiscal years total and and after convertible senior notes operating lease commitments other obligations total contractual cash obligations as further discussed in notes to consolidated financial statements note convertible senior notes due  we may  at our option  redeem some or all of the notes on or after february  holders of our convertible senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase some or all of the outstanding notes on february   february  and february  and upon certain events 
the notes can be converted  at the option of the noteholders  during the conversion period of september  through december  upon receiving notification of a noteholder s intent to convert  we  in accordance with the provisions of the indenture  will inform the noteholder of our intention to deliver shares of common stock or cash  or a combination thereof 
we have entered into standby letter of credit agreements with financial institutions relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts 
at july   the balance of these agreements was million 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
in the event that we identify a significant acquisition that requires additional cash  we would seek to borrow funds or raise additional equity capital 
legal proceedings hurricane related proceedings during fiscal  two of our leased facilities located in florida experienced hurricane damage to both leasehold improvements and personal property 
as of july   we have completed all restoration efforts relating to the hurricane damage and have recorded a million insurance recovery receivable and accrued a total of million for hurricane related costs 
despite a written agreement with the general contractor that we believe limits our liability for the cost of the repairs to the amount of insurance proceeds ultimately received from our insurance company  a dispute has arisen with the general contractor and a certain subcontractor over the subcontractor s demand for payment directly from us by virtue of a purported assignment of rights and other grounds in an amount exceeding the insurance proceeds by million  plus late charges  interest  fees  costs and certain treble damages 
as a result of this dispute  we deposited approximately million  representing the balance of the insurance proceeds received  in our attorney s trust account and filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the th judicial circuit court for orange county  florida 
the general contractor and the subcontractor have filed separate and independent actions against us and our insurance company  all of which have now been consolidated under our original action 
the court has postponed the trial date several times and has not scheduled a new date 
we have also filed a cross claim against our insurance company asserting that the insurer is responsible for whatever liability  if any  we are ultimately adjudged to have to the general contractor or the subcontractor 
however  to the extent that insurance recoveries are inadequate  we might be required to fund the shortfall 
all parties have held and are currently engaged in mediation and settlement discussions 
however  to date  no agreements have been reached 
we do not expect that the outcome of this matter will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition 
other legal proceedings in march  a lawsuit was brought against us in the federal district court for the western district of texas by a company that claims that it was a consultant and a reseller of certain of our products and that it is owed damages for alleged lost profits  as well as punitive damages  costs and attorney s fees 
we believe that we have substantial legal and factual defenses to the plaintiff s allegations and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter 
we do not expect that the ultimate outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 
we are party to certain other legal actions  which arise in the normal course of business 
although the ultimate outcome of litigation is difficult to accurately predict  we believe that the outcome of these actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations

 fair value measurements sfas no 
to clarify the definition of fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand the disclosures on fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
sfas no 
also stipulates that  as a market based measurement  fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  and establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between a market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and b the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 
sfas no 
will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal and we are currently evaluating the impact its adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements

sab no 
which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement

in july  the fasb released fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income tax law and prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
fin prescribes a two step evaluation process for tax positions 
the first step is recognition based on a determination of whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more likely than not threshold 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 
we adopted fin on august  and its adoption had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement eitf 
eitf provides that taxes imposed by a governmental authority on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer should be shown in the income statement on either a gross or a net basis  based on the entity s accounting policy  which should be disclosed pursuant to apb opinion no 
 disclosure of accounting policies 
we adopted eitf in the first quarter of fiscal and continue to present taxes within the scope of eitf on a net basis 
as such  the adoption of eitf did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates  primarily from our investment of available cash balances 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
if the interest rate we receive on our investment of available cash balances were to change by  our interest income would be impacted by approximately million 
our convertible senior notes bear a fixed rate of interest 
as such  our earnings and cash flows are not sensitive to changes in interest rates on our long term debt
