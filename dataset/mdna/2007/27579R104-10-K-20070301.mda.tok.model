item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information about the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources of east west bancorp  inc and its subsidiaries 
this information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our financial condition and the results of our operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein 
information related to share volume and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the two for one stock split that became effective on june  critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the banking industry 
the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
all of our significant accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
in addition  certain accounting policies require significant judgment in applying complex accounting principles to individual transactions to determine the most appropriate treatment 
we have established procedures and processes to facilitate making the judgments necessary to prepare financial statements 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental and complex accounting estimates and principles 
in each area  we have identified the variables most important in the estimation process 
we have used the best information available to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities 
actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key variables could change future valuations and impact net income 
investment securities the classification and accounting for investment securities are discussed in detail in note of the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities generally must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management s intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise  whereas for available for sale securities  they are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and do not affect earnings until realized 
the fair values of our investment securities are generally determined by reference to quoted market prices and reliable independent sources 
we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
such impairment must be recognized in current earnings rather than in other comprehensive income 
we examine all individual securities that are in an unrealized loss position at each reporting date for other than temporary impairment 
specific investment level factors we examine to assess impairment include the severity and duration of the loss  an analysis of the issuers of the securities and if there has been any cause for default on the securities and any change in the rating of the securities by the various rating agencies 
additionally  we reexamine the financial resources and overall ability the company has and the intent management has to hold the securities until their fair values recover 
management does not believe that there are any investment securities  other than those identified in previous periods  which are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as of december  investment securities are discussed in more detail in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan loss methodologies incorporate a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative  in establishing an allowance for loan loss that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience  delinquency and chargeoff trends  collateral values  changes in nonperforming loans  and other factors 
quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans  including borrowers sensitivity to interest rate movements and borrowers sensitivity to quantifiable external factors including commodity and finished good prices as well as acts of nature earthquakes  floods  fires  etc 
that occur in a particular period 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in our markets and  in particular  the state of certain industries 
size and complexity of individual credits  loan structure  extent and nature of waivers of existing loan policies and pace of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered in our methodologies 
a detailed discussion of our allowance for loan loss methodologies can be found in management s discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations allowance for loan losses 
as we add new products  increase the complexity of our loan portfolio  and expand our geographic coverage  we continue to enhance our methodologies to keep pace with the size and complexity of the loan portfolio 
changes in any of the factors cited above could have a significant impact on the loan loss calculation 
we believe that our methodologies continue to be appropriate given our size and level of complexity 
this discussion should also be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein including the section entitled loans and allowance for loan losses 
loan sales we routinely sell and securitize single family and multifamily loans to secondary market investors 
when mortgage loans are sold  we generally retain the right to service these loans and we may retain residual and other interests  which are considered retained interests in the sold or securitized loans 
the gain on sale recorded on these loans depends  in part  on our allocation of the previous carrying amount of the loans to the retained interests 
previous carrying amounts are allocated in proportion to the relative fair values of the loans sold and the interests retained 
the fair values of retained interests are estimated based upon the present value of the associated expected future cash flows taking into consideration future prepayment rates  discount rates  expected credit losses  and other factors that impact the value of the retained interests 
we may also record mortgage servicing assets  or msa  when the benefits of servicing are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer 
the company determines whether the benefits of servicing are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer by discounting all of the future net cash flows associated with the contractual rights and obligations of the servicing agreement 
the expected future net cash flows are discounted at a rate equal to the return that would adequately compensate a substitute servicer for performing the servicing 
in addition to the anticipated rate of loan prepayments and discount rates  other assumptions such as the cost to service the underlying loans  foreclosure costs  ancillary income and float rates are also used in determining the value of the msas 
mortgage servicing assets are discussed in more detail in notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
goodwill impairment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances  such as adverse changes in the business  indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test 
impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level which is the same level as the company s four major operating segments identified in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
the first part of the test is a comparison  at the reporting unit level  of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  then the second part of the test is needed to measure the amount of potential goodwill impairment 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is calculated and compared to the actual carrying value of goodwill recorded within the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  then the company would recognize an impairment loss for the amount of the difference  which would be recorded as a charge against net income 
the fair values of the reporting units are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models based on each reporting unit s internal forecasts 
for additional information regarding goodwill  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
share based compensation we account for share based awards to employees  officers  and directors in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
we adopted sfas no 
r  as required  on january  prior to  we recognized stock based compensation expense for employee share based awards based on their intrinsic value on the date of grant pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and followed the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective approach 
under the modified prospective approach  prior periods are not restated for comparative purposes 
the valuation provisions of sfas no 
r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified  repurchased or cancelled 
compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  for awards outstanding at the effective date is recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas no 
we have granted nonqualified stock options and restricted stock 
most of our stock option and restricted stock awards include a service condition that relates only to vesting 
the stock option awards generally vest in one to four years from the grant date  while the restricted stock awards generally vest in three to five years from the date of grant 
compensation expense is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award  which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award 
we use an option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of our stock options which is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these methods used to determine these variables are generally similar to the methods used prior to for the purposes of our pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
we make assumptions regarding expected term  expected volatility  expected dividend yield  and risk free interest rate in determining the fair value of our stock options 
the expected term represents the weighted average period that stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term assumption is estimated based on the stock options vesting terms and remaining contractual life and employees historical exercise behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period of time equal to the expected term of the stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the company s current dividend payout rate on its common stock 
for the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant appropriate for the term of the employee stock options 
for restricted share awards  the grant date fair value is measured at the fair value of the company s common stock as if the restricted share was vested and issued on the date of grant 
as share based compensation expense under sfas no 
r is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
share based compensation is discussed in more detail in notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
overview during  we achieved another year of record financial performance attaining our tenth consecutive year of record earnings 
our increase in diluted earnings per share for represents one of the highest earnings per share growth rates among our peer banks 
these consistently solid financial results have been achieved over various economic  interest rate and real estate cycles 
we also ended the year on a very positive note with fourth quarter earnings amounting to million  representing a increase over the corresponding quarter in the previous year 
we are highly encouraged by the results of the fourth quarter and plan to build on this momentum in one of the highlights of was the successful completion of another large acquisition 
standard bank was headquartered in monterey park  california and provided community banking services through six branches in the los angeles metropolitan area which are prime locations in the bank s niche market 
as of the transaction closing date of march   standard bank had total assets of million  net loans of million  and total deposits of million 
the acquisition resulted in total goodwill of million and core deposit premium of million 
all of standard bank s systems have been successfully integrated into our infrastructure 
this strategic acquisition has enhanced the bank s already strong franchise in the ethnic chinese american retail and commercial markets 
during  we also made noteworthy strides in expanding our market presence in the greater china region 
we received approval from the hong kong monetary authority hkma on august  to open a full service branch in hong kong 
this branch commenced operations during the first quarter of  offering a variety of deposit  loan and international banking products 
additionally  we recently received regulatory approval to open a representative office in shanghai  china 
similar to our existing representative office in beijing  the shanghai office will broaden our international banking capabilities and extend our penetration into the robust greater china market 
we anticipate the shanghai office to open sometime in the second quarter of net income totaled million during  a increase from the million earned during as previously mentioned  diluted earnings per share for the full year increased to from in our return on average assets in was  compared to in and return on average equity was in  compared to in management expects net income per diluted common share for to be to higher than in based on a projected annual loan growth of to and annual deposit growth of to 
our earnings projection for also assumes a stable interest rate environment and a strategy to securitize loans on a consistent basis to improve liquidity and to reduce overall credit risk 
net interest income increased to million during  compared with million during the substantial increase in net interest income is predominantly due to the growth in loans and investment securities compounded by steady increases in interest rates by the federal reserve during these factors were partially offset by increases in both the volume and rates paid for time deposits and money market accounts  as well as growth in the volume of all types of borrowings and higher rates paid on fhlb advances 
our net interest margin decreased basis points to during  compared to during the continuing competitiveness in loan and deposit pricing as well as the flat to inverted yield curve throughout adversely impacted our net interest margin during assuming a stable interest rate environment during  we anticipate the net interest margin for to be in the range of and 
noninterest income increased to million during from million in the prior year  primarily due to higher branch related fees as well as higher mortgage servicing fees resulting from increased loan securitization activity during these factors were partially offset by lower net gains on sales of investment securities available for sale and lower income from secondary market activities 
as a result of our continued expansion during  total noninterest expense increased to million in  compared with million in this increase is primarily driven by a increase in compensation and employee benefits  a increase in occupancy and equipment expenses  and a increase in other operating expenses 
the increases in compensation  occupancy  and other operating expenses can be attributed to the acquisitions of united national bank during the third quarter of and standard bank in the first quarter of occupancy expenses also increased due to the recent relocation and expansion of our corporate offices and other operating expenses increased due to higher professional fees and advertising expenses 
despite the sizable increase in overall expenses  our efficiency ratio  which represents noninterest expense excluding the amortization of intangibles and investments in affordable housing partnerships divided by the aggregate of net interest income before provision for loan losses and noninterest income  increased only marginally to during  compared to during we believe this to be a reflection of our ability to efficiently and effectively utilize our resources and operating platform to support our continuing growth 
due to the continuing growth of the bank  we anticipate noninterest expenses for to increase by approximately to  and our efficiency ratio for the full year of to be in the to range 
total consolidated assets at december  increased to billion  compared with billion at december  a growth in gross loans and an growth in investment securities were the primary drivers of this increase 
excluding the impact of the standard bank acquisition and residential loan securitizations  organic loan growth was  or billion  during we attribute overall loan growth to the continued expansion of relationships throughout california  the addition of seasoned and skilled banking professionals  and increased loan origination volume from our branch network 
we estimate loan growth in to be to  reflecting the core rate of growth in the bank s lending markets  the addition of new client relationships  and the utilization of additional lending programs and products 
total average assets increased to billion in  compared to billion in  due primarily to the growth in average loans and investment securities 
total average loans grew to billion during  with all major loan sectors experienced double digit growth during total average investment securities increased to billion during primarily due to million in residential loan securitizations during the year 
total average deposits rose during to billion  compared to billion in we experienced gains in all deposit categories during  with the most significant contributions coming from time and money market deposits 
total nonperforming assets were million  or of total assets at december   compared with million  or of total assets  at december  the allowance for loan losses totaled million at december   representing of outstanding total loans 
we continue to experience historically low levels and little or no loss in almost every segment of our loan portfolio 
during  net loan recoveries totaled thousand  representing of average loans during this compares with million in net loan chargeoffs  or of average loans  during we anticipate our overall asset quality to remain sound throughout we estimate the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans to range from to for  reflecting our continued strategy of loan securitizations combined with credit quality remaining at high levels 
we continue to be well capitalized under all regulatory guidelines with a tier i risk based capital ratio of  a total risk based capital ratio of  and a tier i leverage ratio of at december  during  we raised million in additional regulatory capital through the issuance of trust preferred securities in a trust preferred offering 
trust preferred securities currently qualify as tier i capital for regulatory purposes 
the net proceeds from the trust preferred offering were used to partially fund the acquisition of standard bank and also to support the continued growth of the bank 
in recognition of the bank s consistent and solid financial performance  the board of directors authorized a increase in the quarterly cash dividends paid to shareholders 
commencing with the first quarter of  cash dividends will increase to per share  compared with the per share paid in previous quarters 
additionally  the board has also authorized a new stock repurchase program to buy back up to million of the company s common stock 
this dividend increase  along with the new stock repurchase program  reflect not only our commitment to return capital to our shareholders  but also our continued confidence about the future of the company 
results of operations net income for totaled million  compared with million for and million for  representing an increase of for and for on a per diluted share basis  net income was  and for  and  respectively 
the increases in net earnings during both and are primarily attributable to higher net interest income  partially offset by higher operating expenses and higher provision for income taxes 
our return on average total assets declined to in  compared to in and in the decrease in our return on average total assets during  relative to and  is due to the company s significant growth both organically and through the recent acquisitions of standard bank in march and united national bank in september our return on average stockholders equity also decreased to in  compared with in and in the decrease in the return on average stockholders equity during  compared to  resulted from the issuance of additional shares of company common stock in connection with the acquisition of standard bank

total interest expense during increased to million compared with million a year ago 
the increase in interest expense during can be attributed to both the significant growth in average interest bearing liabilities  predominantly time deposits  money market accounts  and repurchase agreements  as well as higher rates paid on all categories of interest bearing liabilities  reflecting the current interest rate environment and sustained pricing competition in the deposit market 
net interest margin  defined as net interest income divided by average earning assets  decreased basis points to during  from during the overall yield on earning assets increased basis points to in  from in  due to several consecutive federal reserve interest rate increases during our funding cost on interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points to during  compared to for the combined impact of the current interest rate environment and continued competition in the deposit market were the primary drivers of our increased cost of funds during to help fund our substantial loan growth during  we increased our reliance on time deposits  other borrowings and long term debt  further contributing to the overall increase in our cost of funds for the year 
we also continue to rely on noninterest bearing demand deposits as a funding source  with average noninterest bearing demand deposits increasing to billion during  compared to billion in our overall cost of funds  which takes into account our portfolio of noninterest bearing demand deposits  increased basis points to during  compared to for the previous year

the fund provided state tax benefits beginning in until the end of  when the ric was officially dissolved 
while the company s management continues to believe that the tax benefits realized in previous years were appropriate and fully defensible under the existing tax codes at that time  the company has deemed it prudent to participate in the voluntary compliance initiative  or vci offered by the state of california to avoid certain potential penalties should the ftb choose to litigate its recently announced position about the tax treatment of rics for periods prior to enactment of the legislation described above and should the ftb be successful in that litigation 
pursuant to the vci program  we filed amended california income tax returns on april  for all affected years and paid the resulting taxes and interest due to the ftb 
this amounted to an aggregate payment of million for tax years   and we continue to believe that the tax deductions are appropriate and  as such  we have also filed refund claims for the amounts paid with the amended returns 
these refund claims are reflected as assets in the company s consolidated financial statements 
as a result of these actions amending our california income tax returns and subsequent related filing of refund claims we retain our potential exposure for assertion of an accuracy related penalty should the ftb prevail in its position  in addition to our risk of not being successful in our refund claim for taxes and interest 
our potential exposure to all other penalties  however  has been eliminated through this course of action 
the franchise tax board is currently in the process of reviewing and assessing our refund claims for taxes and interest for tax years through management is continuing to pursue these claims  to monitor developments in the law in this area  and to monitor the status of tax claims with respect to other registered investment companies 
management has considered this claim as part of its evaluation of uncertain tax provision in accordance with the provision of fin during the first quarter of  the adoption of this standard is expected to result in a reduction of retained earnings by approximately million to million 
operating segment results the company has identified four principal operating segments for purposes of management reporting retail banking  commercial lending  treasury  and residential lending 
although all four operating segments offer financial products and services  they are managed separately based on each segment s strategic focus 
while the retail banking segment focuses primarily on retail operations through the bank s branch network  certain designated branches have responsibility for generating commercial deposits and loans 
the commercial lending segment  which includes commercial real estate  primarily generates commercial loans and deposits through the efforts of commercial lending officers located in the bank s northern and southern california production offices 
the treasury department s primary focus is managing the bank s investments  liquidity  and interest rate risk  the residential lending segment is mainly responsible for the bank s portfolio of single family and multifamily residential loans 
the company s remaining centralized functions and eliminations of inter segment amounts have been aggregated and included in other 
future changes in the company s management structure or reporting methodologies may result in changes in the measurement of operating segment results 
results for prior periods have been restated for comparability for changes in management structure or reporting methodologies 
specifically  an adjustment was made to reallocate the credit provided for in the company s capital to the treasury segment from the other category 
the adjustment resulted in an increase to the treasury segment s pre tax profit of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for more information about our segments  including information about the underlying accounting and reporting process  please see note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
retail banking the retail banking segment s pre tax income increased to million in  from million in the increase in pre tax income for the retail banking segment is largely attributable to the growth in net interest income increasing to million in compared to million in the increase in net interest income is primarily due to our overall growth  both organically and through acquisitions 
the acquisitions of united national bank in september and standard bank in march added seventeen new locations to our expanding branch network as well as several thousand new customers to our existing customer base 
noninterest income for this segment increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase in noninterest income during is primarily due to fee income growth from loan origination and deposit gathering activities  as well as higher fees earned from alternative investment product offerings at the branches 
noninterest expense for this segment increased to million in from million in the increase in noninterest expense during is primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits  occupancy expenses and other operating expenses 
the increase in compensation and employee benefits can be attributed to higher staffing levels due to the acquisitions of united national bank and standard bank  as well as the addition of relationship officers and operational personnel throughout the past year 
higher occupancy expenses are due primarily to increased expenses associated with eleven additional branch locations from united national bank  six additional branch locations from standard bank  and a new in store branch location opened in march the increase in other operating expenses can be attributed predominantly to the overall growth in this segment arising from recent acquisitions 
commercial lending the commercial lending segment s pre tax income increased to million in from million in the primary driver of the increase in pre tax income for this segment is a increase in net interest income to million in from million in the increase in net interest income during is primarily due to the notable growth of our commercial loan portfolio  which includes commercial real estate  construction  and commercial business loans  including trade finance products  during the past year 
specifically  the average aggregate balance of all commercial loan categories grew during as compared to noninterest income for this segment increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in noninterest income during is primarily due to higher ancillary loan fees collected as a result of the growth in loan origination volume during noninterest expense for this segment increased to million in from million in the increase in noninterest expense during is largely a result of higher compensation and employee benefits which increased to million in from million in the increase in compensation and employee benefits resulted from increased staffing levels due to the acquisitions of united national bank and standard bank as well as the addition of relationship officers and operational personnel to support the continuing growth of the bank 
treasury the treasury segment s pre tax income increased to million in from million in net interest income increased to million in from million in  largely as a result of higher interest earned on investment securities relative to the interest expense paid on borrowings 
noninterest income for this segment declined to million in from million in the decrease in noninterest income during can be attributed entirely to lower net gains on sales of investment securities relative to noninterest expense for this segment increased to million in from million in the increase in noninterest expense during is primarily due to higher compensation expense resulting from increased staffing levels 
residential lending the residential lending segment s pre tax income decreased to million in from million in the decrease in pre tax income is partly due to the decrease in net interest income for this segment  which declined to million in from million in the decrease in net interest income reflects the highly competitive market pricing environment for residential mortgage loans as well as the bank s increased securitization activity of single family and multifamily loans which totaled million during noninterest income for this segment also decreased during to million  or  from million during the net decrease in noninterest income during is primarily due to fees waived as well as lower fees collected on single family and multifamily loan products resulting from competitive market pressures 
noninterest expense for this segment declined to million in from million in the decrease in noninterest expense during is due to lower compensation and employee benefits and other operating expenses 
these expenses were partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to the relocation of the residential unit during the third quarter of balance sheet analysis total assets increased billion  or  to billion during the year ended december  the increase in total assets was primarily attributable to a growth in gross loans and an increase in investment securities available for sale 
gross loans rose to a record billion at december   compared to billion at december  we attribute overall loan growth to the continued expansion of lending relationships with new customers as well as cross selling to existing customers  increased loan origination volume from our branch network  and the addition of personnel to enhance and support loan and deposit growth 
additionally  the recent acquisition of standard bank further contributed to our loan growth during the year 
we were able to fund the increase in loans and available for sale securities through deposit growth totaling million as well as increases in borrowings and long term debt of billion 
securities purchased under resale agreements we purchase securities under resale agreements resale agreements with terms that range from one day to several years 
total resale agreements increased to million as of december  and were comprised entirely of long term agreements 
the increase is due to a million resale agreement that we entered into during february this new agreement has a term of ten years with an interest rate that is fixed at for the first two years and thereafter becomes a floating rate based on the three month libor plus basis points 
the counterparty has the right to a quarterly call after the first year 
in september  the company entered into a long term resale agreement totaling million with a ten year term and an interest rate that is fixed at for the first year and thereafter becomes floating rate based on the three month libor plus basis points 
the counterparty has the right to a quarterly call after the first two years 
there are no interest payments on these agreements if certain swap yield curves are inverted 
the collateral for these agreements are held by a third party custodian and consists of us government agency and or us government sponsored enterprise debt and mortgage backed securities 
purchases of securities under resale agreements are overcollateralized to ensure against unfavorable market price movements 
we monitor the market value of the underlying securities which collateralize the related receivable on resale agreements  including accrued interest 
in the event that the fair market value of the securities decreases below the carrying amount of the related repurchase agreement  our counterparty is required to designate an equivalent value of additional securities 
the counterparties to these agreements are nationally recognized investment banking firms that meet credit eligibility criteria and with whom a master repurchase agreement has been duly executed 
investment securities available for sale income from investing activities provides a significant portion of our total income 
we aim to maintain an investment portfolio with an adequate mix of fixed rate and adjustable rate securities with relatively short maturities to minimize overall interest rate risk 
our investment securities portfolio consists of us treasury securities  us government agency securities  us government sponsored enterprise debt securities  mortgage backed securities  corporate debt  and us government sponsored enterprise equity securities 
we currently classify our entire investment portfolio as available for sale  and accordingly  these securities are carried at their estimated fair values with the corresponding changes in fair values recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  as a component of stockholders equity 
total investment securities available for sale increased to billion as of december  the large increase in available for sale securities is primarily due to the bank s increased securitization activity during total repayments maturities and proceeds from sales of available for sale securities amounted to billion and million  respectively  during proceeds from repayments  maturities  sales  and redemptions were applied towards additional investment securities purchases totaling billion as well as funding a portion of loan originations made during we recorded net gains totaling million and million on sales of available for sale securities during and  respectively 
at december   investment securities available for sale with a carrying value of billion were pledged to secure public deposits  fhlb advances  repurchase agreements  and for other purposes required or permitted by law 
during  we completed several securitization transactions involving both single family and multifamily loans 
we securitized million in single family loans and million in multifamily loans in two private label guaranteed mortgage securitizations issued through east west mortgage securities  llc 
additionally  we also securitized million in multifamily loans through the federal national mortgage association fnma 
we recorded million in mortgage servicing assets in connection with these transactions as the bank continues to service the underlying loans 
we retained all of the resulting securities from these securitization transactions in our available for sale investment portfolio 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  a replacement of fasb statement no 
 these transactions were accounted for as neither sales nor financings which had no impact on our results of operations 
as part of our ongoing strategy  we plan to securitize additional single family and multifamily loans for liquidity  credit risk and capital management purposes 
we perform regular impairment analyses on the investment securities available for sale portfolio 
if we determine that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  an impairment writedown is recognized in current earnings 
other than temporary declines in fair value are assessed based on the duration the security has been in a continuous unrealized loss position  the severity of the decline in value  the rating of the security and our ability and intent on holding the securities until the fair values recover 
we had individual securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or longer at december  all of these securities had investment grade ratings upon purchase 
the issuers of these securities have not  to our knowledge  established any cause for default on these securities and the various rating agencies have reaffirmed these securities long term investment grade status at december  we have the ability and the intention to hold these securities until their fair values recover 
as such  management does not believe that there are any securities  other than those previously identified in prior periods  that are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  and therefore  no additional impairment charges as of december  are warranted

our lending activities consist of residential single family loans  residential multifamily loans  commercial real estate loans  construction loans  commercial business loans  trade finance loans  and consumer loans 
net loans receivable increased billion  or  to billion at december  the increase in loans during was funded primarily through growth in deposits  borrowings  and long term debt

at december   million or of the loan portfolio was secured by one to four family residential real estate properties  compared to million or at december  residential single family loan origination activity continued to grow in  resulting in million in new loan originations during the year 
as compared to  we experienced an increase in the origination of adjustable rate loans over fixed rate loans as interest rates continued to steadily increase in since we generally only sell fixed rate loans in the secondary market  the rising rate environment continued to constrain our secondary marketing efforts during specifically  we sold approximately million in conforming and non conforming residential single family loans through our secondary marketing efforts during  compared to million sold in if interest rates continue to rise  we anticipate a sustained contraction in our secondary marketing activities during during  we securitized million in single family loans in two separate private label guaranteed mortgage securitizations 
all of the resulting securities were retained in our available for sale investment portfolio 
the securitizations were accounted for as neither sales nor financings which had no impact on our results of operations 
we also recorded approximately million in mortgage servicing assets in connection with these single family securitizations since the bank continues to service the underlying loans 
we expect to securitize additional single family loans during as part of our ongoing strategy to manage our liquidity  capital and credit risk 
we offer both fixed and adjustable rate arm single family residential mortgage loan programs 
we primarily offer arm loan programs that have six month  three year  five year  or seven year initial fixed periods 
we originate single family residential mortgage loans under three different types of programs full alternative documentation  reduced documentation and no documentation loans 
the underwriting criteria for these loan programs vary in income and asset documentation levels 
our underwriting criteria for all the loans in our single family residential mortgage loan programs include minimum fico scores and maximum loan to value ratios 
additionally  our full alternative documentation loan program requires verification of employment and income 
reduced documentation loans are primarily intended for borrowers who are self employed 
generally  we require reduced documentation borrowers to have more equity in the property and higher amounts of liquid reserves 
finally  our no documentation loan program is designed for borrowers who demonstrate excellent credit quality and have the ability to place a large down payment or have high equity in the property 
of the million in residential single family mortgage loans originated during  or million were full alternative documentation loans  or million were reduced documentation loans and or million were no documentation loans 
multifamily real estate loans 
we continue to place emphasis in the origination of multifamily loans and originated million multifamily loans during although real estate lending activities are collateralized by real property  these transactions are subject to similar credit evaluation  underwriting and monitoring standards as those applied to commercial business loans 
multifamily real estate loans accounted for billion or  and billion or  of our loan portfolio at december  and  respectively 
we securitized a total of million in multifamily loans during  predominantly through fnma 
the securitizations were undertaken for liquidity  credit risk  and capital management purposes  with all of the resulting securities retained in our available for sale investment portfolio 
the securitizations were accounted for as neither sales nor financings which had no impact on our results of operations 
we also recorded approximately million in mortgage servicing assets in connection with these multifamily securitizations since the bank continues to service the underlying loans 
we offer both fixed and adjustable rate multifamily loan programs 
we primarily offer adjustable rate multifamily loan programs that have six month  three year  or five year initial fixed periods 
we originate these multifamily mortgage loans under two different types of programs  full documentation and reduced documentation loans 
the underwriting criteria for these loan programs vary in income and asset documentation levels  similar to the programs mentioned in the single family residential loan programs 
underwriting criteria generally include minimum fico scores  maximum loan to value ratios and minimum debt coverage ratios 
additionally  we own single family and multifamily residential mortgage loans that have contractual features that may increase our credit exposure 
these mortgage loans include adjustable rate mortgage loans that may subject borrowers to significant future payment increases or create the potential for negative amortization of the principal balance 
interest only mortgage loans allow interest only payments for fixed period of time 
at the end of the interest only period  the loan payment includes principal payments and increases significantly 
the borrower s new payment once the loan becomes amortizing ie  includes principal payments will be greater than if the borrower had been making principal payments since the origination of the loan 
the longer the interest only period  the larger the amortizing payment will be when the interest only period ends 
as of december   there were million in interest only loans held in our portfolio  adjustable rate mortgage loans permit different repayment options 
the monthly payment for adjustable rate mortgage loans with negative amortization features is set as the initial interest rate for the first year of the loan 
after that point  the borrower can make a minimum payment that is limited to a increase in payment 
if the minimum payment is not adequate to cover the interest amount due on the mortgage loan  the loan would have negative amortization  which will result in an increase in the mortgage loans principal balance 
these loans completely re amortize every five years and the monthly payment is reset at that point 
none of the adjustable rate mortgages held in our loan portfolio which have the potential to negatively amortize were actually negatively amortizing as of december  and we did not originate these loans and they were purchased several years ago 
our total exposure related to these products included in loans receivable for the years ended december  and is summarized as follows table nontraditional mortgage products unpaid principal balance as of december  in thousands interest only mortgage loans adjustable rate mortgages with negative amortization features residential single family loans residential multifamily loans all of the loans we originate are subject to our underwriting guidelines and loan origination standards 
generally  loans obtained from third party originators  including the higher risk loans in the preceding table  are closed and funded in our name and are also subject to our same underwriting guidelines and loan origination standards 
we believe our strict underwriting criteria and procedures adequately consider the unique risks which may come from these products 
we conduct a variety of quality control procedures and periodic audits to ensure compliance with our origination standards  including our criteria for lending and legal requirements 
commercial real estate loans 
we continue to place emphasis in the origination of commercial real estate loans 
although real estate lending activities are collateralized by real property  these transactions are subject to similar credit evaluation  underwriting and monitoring standards as those applied to commercial business loans 
commercial real estate loans accounted for billion or  and billion or  of our loan portfolio at december   and  respectively 
since substantially all of our real estate loans are secured by properties located in california  declines in the california economy and in real estate values could have a significant effect on the collectibility of our loans and on the level of allowance for loan losses required

generally  our policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status if either i principal or interest payments are past due in excess of days  or ii the full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain  regardless of the length of past due status 
when a loan reaches nonaccrual status  any interest accrued on the loan is reversed and charged against current income 
in general  subsequent payments received are applied to the outstanding principal balance of the loan 
nonaccrual loans that demonstrate a satisfactory payment trend for several months are returned to full accrual status subject to management s assessment of the full collectibility of the account

 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended 
under sfas no 
 loans are considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  including scheduled interest payments 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as an expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  less costs to sell 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the deficiency will be charged off against the allowance for loan losses or  alternatively  a specific allocation will be established 
also  in accordance with sfas no 
 loans that are considered impaired are specifically excluded from the quarterly migration analysis when determining the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses required for the period 
at december   we classified million of our loans as impaired  compared with million at december  there were no specific reserves on impaired loans at december   compared to million at december  our average recorded investment in impaired loans during and was million and million  respectively 
during and  gross interest income that would have been recorded on impaired loans  had they performed in accordance with their original terms  totaled million and million  respectively 
of this amount  actual interest recognized on impaired loans  on a cash basis  was thousand and thousand  respectively 
allowance for loan losses we are committed to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level that is commensurate with estimated and known risks in the loan portfolio 
in addition to regular  quarterly reviews of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management performs an ongoing assessment of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
while we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate at december   future additions to the allowance will be subject to a continuing evaluation of estimated and known  as well as inherent  risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses which is charged against current period operating results  and is increased or decreased by the amount of net recoveries or chargeoffs  respectively  during the year 
at december   the allowance for loan losses amounted to million  or of total loans  compared with million  or of total loans  at december  the million increase in the allowance for loan losses at december   from year end  reflects million in additional loss provisions and million in loss reserves acquired from standard bank  increased by thousand in net recoveries during the year 
additionally  we reclassified million from the allowance for loan losses to other liabilities during this amount represents additional loss allowances required for unfunded loan commitments and off balance sheet credit exposures related primarily to our trade finance lending activities 
the allowance for unfunded commitments and off balance sheet credit exposures is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities and amounted to million at december  the provision for loan losses of million recorded in represents a decrease from the million in loss provisions recorded during the decrease in loss provisions recorded during  compared to  is primarily due to the strength of our credit quality 
we continue to experience historically low levels of nonperforming assets and little or no loss in almost every loan category 
during  we recorded thousand in net recoveries representing less than of average loans outstanding during the year 
in comparison  we recorded net chargeoffs totaling million  or of average loans outstanding  during we continue to record loss provisions in response to both the continued growth of our loan portfolio  which grew during  and our continued lending focus on increasing our portfolio of commercial real estate  commercial business  trade finance  and construction loans 
however  we anticipate recording a lower level of loss provisions in the foreseeable future in light of our strategy to securitize loans on a consistent basis to reduce overall credit risk  combined with our credit quality expected to remain at high levels

the result from this methodology is compared to analyses derived from peer group comparisons as well as the federal regulatory interagency policy for loan and lease losses to determine an overall allowance requirement amount 
in consideration of the significant growth and increasing diversity and credit risk profiles of loans in our loan portfolio in the past several years  our classification migration model utilizes eighteen risk rated loan pool categories and three homogeneous loan categories 
the loan sectors included in the risk rated loan pools are single family  multifamily  commercial real estate  construction  commercial business  trade finance  and automobile loans 
with the exception of automobile loans  all other risk rated categories have been broken down into additional subcategories 
for example  the commercial real estate loan category is further segmented into six subcategories based on industry sector  namely  retail  office  industrial  land  hotel motel  and other miscellaneous 
by sectionalizing these broad loan categories into smaller subgroups  we are better able to isolate and identify the risk associated with each subgroup based on historical loss trends 
in addition to the eighteen risk rated loan categories  our classification migration model also utilizes three homogeneous loan categories which encompass predominantly consumer related credits 
specifically  these homogeneous loan categories are home equity lines  overdraft protection  and credit card loans 
we utilize a loss horizon of fifteen years to better capture the bank s historical loss trends 
this loss horizon represents the timeframe when the bank started to monitor and track losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
we utilize a number of self correcting mechanisms to better reflect the loss potential for certain categories that have little or no historical losses 
during the third quarter of  we set an upper limit of basis points as the maximum differential between historical loss rates and minimum loss rates for loans with a pass rating in all loan categories 
the allowance requirement for each pool continues to be based on the higher of historical loss factors or established minimum loss rates for each classification category ie pass  special mention  substandard  and doubtful 
besides quantitative adjustments  the enhanced classification migration methodology also utilizes qualitative adjustments 
these qualitative adjustments include credit concentrations  delinquency  nonaccrual and problem loan trends  qualification of lending management and staff  and quality of the loan review system  economic risk considerations  and estimation or modeling risk associated with the classification migration model 
qualitative adjustments can be either positive or negative  and generally range from to 
total net qualitative adjustments for each loan pool are reflected as a percent adjustment and are calculated on top of the required allowance amount based on historical losses or minimum loss rates 
the following table reflects management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category and the ratio of each loan category to total loans as of the dates indicated 
table allowance for loan losses by loan category at december  amount amount dollars in thousands residential single family residential multifamily commercial and industrial real estate construction commercial business trade finance automobile consumer and other total despite a decrease in the volume of residential single family loans at december  relative to year end levels  loss reserves on single family loans increased thousand  or  to million at december  the increase in loss reserves in this category was due primarily to an increase in criticized ie rated special mention and classified ie rated substandard or doubtful single family loans at december  in comparison to year end levels 
specifically  criticized and classified single family loans amounted to thousand and million  respectively  at december  in comparison  there were no criticized or classified single family loans at december  loss reserves on residential multifamily loans increased million  or  to million at december  partly due to a increase in the volume of multifamily loans at december  from year end levels 
the major contributor to the increase in loss allowances on multifamily loans  however  is an increase in criticized and classified loans at december  compared to december  specifically  multifamily loans rated special mention and substandard increased to million and million  respectively  at december  this compares to million and million in special mention and substandard multifamily loans at december  the significant increase in special mention loans in this category at december  resulted from loan grade definition changes in the watch ii and special mention classification categories implemented during the third quarter of loss reserves on commercial real estate loans increased million  or  to million at december  partly due to a increase in the volume of loans in this category 
further contributing to the increase in loss reserves on commercial real estate loans is an increase in loans rated special mention to million at december   compared to million at december  the large increase in special mention loans in this category at december  came primarily from the retail and land sectors and resulted from loan grade definition changes in the watch ii and special mention classification categories implemented during the third quarter of similarly  commercial real estate loans rated substandard also increased to million as of december   from million as of december   further contributing to the increase in reserves for this category 
the increase in substandard loans in this category came from a few large loans in the industrial  office  retail and special purpose sectors 
these factors were partially offset by the downward adjustment in minimum loss rates established for loans rated pass 
as previously mentioned  the differential between minimum loss rates and historical loss rates was capped at basis points for the pass classification category commencing in the third quarter of to bring these two ratios more in line with each other 
loss reserves on construction loans decreased million  or  to million at december  despite an increase in the volume of loans in this category when compared to december  the decline in loss reserves for this category is predominantly due to the downward adjustment in minimum loss rates established for loans rated pass implemented during the third quarter of partially offsetting the impact of this minimum loss rate adjustment for pass loans is an increase in residential construction loans rated special mention which climbed to million at december   compared to only million at december  the large increase in special mention loans in this category at december  is also a result of loan grade definition changes in the watch ii and special mention classification categories implemented during the third quarter of additionally  one commercial construction loan amounting to million was rated substandard as of december  there were no criticized or classified construction loans on commercial properties at december  residential construction loans represented of the total construction loan portfolio at december   with the remaining comprised of commercial construction loans 
loss reserves on commercial business loans increased million  or  to million at december  partly due to a increase in the volume of loans in this category at december  relative to year end this loan growth is compounded by an increase in criticized loans to million as of december   compared to only million as of december  the large increase in criticized loans at december  resulted from changes in loan grade definitions for the watch ii and special mention classification categories implemented during the third quarter of partially offsetting these factors is a downward adjustment in the minimum loss rates established on commercial business loans rated pass to be more in line with historical losses in this portfolio 
moreover  commercial business loans rated substandard also decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  loss reserves on trade finance loans increased thousand  or  to million at december   due to an increase in the volume of loans in this category at december  relative to year end as well as an increase in criticized and classified loans at december  compared to december  specifically  loans rated special mention and substandard totaled million and million at december   respectively  compared to only million and million at december   respectively 
these factors were partially offset by a decline in the historical loss rate in this portfolio to at december   compared to at december  loss reserves on automobile loans decreased thousand  or  to thousand as of december   despite a increase in the volume of loans in this category at december  relative to december  the decline in required loss reserves for this loan category is due to the downward adjustment in established minimum loss rates for the pass category at december   compared to december  as previously mentioned  the minimum loss rate adjustment for all loan categories was capped at basis points commencing in the third quarter of loss reserves on consumer loans decreased thousand  or  to thousand as of december   primarily due to the decrease in the volume of consumer loans at december  relative to year end consumer loans are comprised predominantly of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit  and to a lesser extent  credit card and overdraft protection lines 
deposits we offer a wide variety of deposit account products to both consumer and commercial customers 
total deposits increased million  or  to billion at december  time deposit products  consisting primarily of retail fixed rate certificates of deposit  totaled billion at december  and comprised of the deposit portfolio at year end in comparison  time deposits amounted to billion at december   representing of the total deposit portfolio as of that date 
core deposits  or non time deposit accounts  increased to billion at december   and represented the remaining of the deposit portfolio at december  core deposits  which include noninterest bearing demand accounts  interest bearing checking accounts  savings accounts and money market accounts  accounted for the remainder of the deposit portfolio at both december  and deposit growth remained challenging as we continued to experience heightened market competition for deposits throughout excluding the million in deposits acquired from standard bank in march  organic deposit growth was during  an increase of million since year end this organic deposit growth was comprised of noninterest bearing demand accounts of million or less than  money market accounts of million or  and time deposits of million or 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in savings accounts of million or and interest bearing checking accounts of million or during the year 
we continue to rely on brokered deposits as a supplemental source of funding 
brokered deposits increased to million at december  from million at december  similarly  public deposits increased to million at december   compared to million as of december  the balance of public funds is comprised predominantly of deposits from the state of california 
time deposits greater than thousand totaled billion  accounting for of the deposit portfolio at december  these accounts  consisting primarily of deposits by consumers and public funds  had a weighted average interest rate of at december  the following table provides the remaining maturities at december  of time deposits greater than thousand table time deposits greater than  in thousands months or less over months through months over months through months over months total borrowings we utilize a combination of short term and long term borrowings to manage our liquidity position 
federal funds purchased generally mature within one to three business days from the transaction date 
at december   federal funds purchased amounted to million  a increase from the million balance at december  fhlb advances increased to billion as of december   compared to million at december  a portion of outstanding fhlb advances at december  totaling million represents overnight advances  compared to million as of december  in january  we entered into million in term fhlb advances with year maturity terms at a fixed rate of in connection with our community reinvestment initiatives 
during march  we assumed million in term fhlb advances from standard bank with original maturity terms ranging from months to years and fixed interest rates ranging from to 
to help fund our robust loan origination activity  we entered into a combined million in additional term fhlb advances during the third and fourth quarters of these advances have maturity terms ranging from months to five years and fixed rates ranging from to in addition to federal funds purchased and fhlb advances  we have outstanding securities sold under repurchase agreements totaling million at december  this compares to million in outstanding repurchase agreements at december  the increase in repurchase agreements at december  is due to four separate issuances of additional repurchase agreements during totaling million 
repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were sold 
the collateral for these agreements consist of us government agency and us government sponsored enterprise debt and mortgage backed securities 
the terms of the outstanding repurchase agreements at december  are ten years 
the rates are all initially floating rate for a period of time ranging from six months to three years  with the floating rates interest ranging from the three month libor minus basis points to the three month libor minus basis points 
thereafter  the rates are fixed for the remainder of the term  with interest rates ranging from to as of december  the counterparty has the right to either a one time call or a quarterly call when the rates change from floating to fixed  for each of the repurchase agreements 
during the second and fourth quarters of  we modified the terms of a million repurchase agreement that we initially entered into in september  in response to the rising interest rate environment 
under the terms of the most recent modification  the interest rate on this ten year instrument for the period from december  through june  is based on the three month libor minus basis points 
thereafter  the rate is fixed at through the extended maturity date of december  the original maturity date of this agreement was september  at december   the interest rate on this repurchase agreement is 
under the terms of the most recent modification  the counterparty has the right to call the transaction on june   and quarterly thereafter until maturity 
also during the fourth quarter of  we modified the terms of a million repurchase agreement that we initially entered into in november  in response to the rising interest rate environment 
under the modified terms of this ten year agreement  the interest rate for this instrument for the period from november  through november  is based on the three month libor minus basis points 
thereafter  the rate is fixed at through the maturity date of november  at december   the interest rate on this repurchase agreement is 
under the terms of the most recent modification  the counterparty has the right to call the transaction on november   and quarterly thereafter until maturity 
the differences in the present values of the cash flows under the new terms of these debt instruments are less than of the present values of the remaining cash flows under the original or previously modified terms 
as such  these modifications of debt terms are not considered substantial  and therefore  do not constitute as debt extinguishments in accordance with the provisions of eitf  debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments 
no gains or losses were recorded in the consolidated statements of income as a result of these debt modifications 
long term debt as of december   long term debt totaled million  compared to million at december  long term debt is comprised of subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt issued in connection with our various trust preferred securities offerings 
the increase in long term debt at december  is due to the issuance of million in junior subordinated debt securities through a pooled trust preferred offering 
similar to previous offerings  these securities were issued through a newly formed statutory business trust  east west capital trust vii  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the securities have a year maturity and bear interest at a per annum rate based on the three month libor plus basis points  payable on a quarterly basis 
this additional issuance of trust preferred securities qualifies as tier i capital for regulatory purposes similar to previous offerings 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations in the course of our business  we may enter into or be a party to transactions that are not recorded on the balance sheet and are considered to be off balance sheet arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements are any contractual arrangements whereby an unconsolidated entity is a party  under which we have any obligation under a guarantee contract  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  or any obligation under a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
loan securitizations and sales in the ordinary course of business  the company sells loans with or without recourse 
for loans sold with recourse  the recourse component is considered a guarantee 
in certain situations  the company could also have an obligation for loans sold without recourse 
additional information pertaining to our loan sales is included in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
from time to time  we securitize certain real estate loans  a portion of which are sold to investors 
securitizations provide us with a source of liquidity and also reduce our credit exposure to borrowers 
securitizations involve the sale of loans to a qualifying special purpose entity  or qspe  typically a trust 
generally  in a securitization  we transfer financial assets to a qspe that is legally isolated from the company 
the qspe  in turn  issues interest bearing securities  commonly called asset backed securities  which are secured by future collections on the sold loans 
the qspe sells securities to investors  which entitle them to receive specified cash flows during the term of the securities 
the qspe uses proceeds from the sale of these securities to pay the purchase price for the sold loans 
the proceeds from the issuance of the securities are then distributed to the company as consideration for the loans transferred 
when we sell or securitize loans  we generally retain the right to service the loans and we may retain residual and other interests  which are considered retained interests in the securitized assets 
retained interests may provide credit enhancement to the investors and represent the company s maximum risk exposure associated with these transactions 
investors in the securities issued by the qspe have no further recourse against the company if cash flows generated by the securitized assets are inadequate to service the obligations of the qspe 
additional information pertaining to our securitization transactions and related retained interests is included in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
commitments  guarantees and contingencies as a financial service provider  we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit to customers  such as loan commitments  commercial letters of credit for foreign and domestic trade  standby letters of credit  and financial guarantees 
many of these commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
the same credit policies are used in extending these commitments as in extending loan facilities to customers 
under some of these contractual agreements  the company may also have liabilities contingent upon the occurrence of certain events 
a schedule of significant commitments to extend credit to customers as of december  is as follows table significant commitments december  in thousands undisbursed loan commitments standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit a discussion of significant contractual arrangements under which the company may be held contingently liable is included in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein

in store banking agreement on august   we entered into a ten year agreement with ranch market to provide in store retail banking services to their stores throughout california 
ranch market is the largest asian focused chain of supermarkets on the west coast  with twenty two full service stores in california  two in washington  and affiliated licensee stores in arizona  georgia  hawaii  nevada  and indonesia 
tawa supermarket companies  or tawa  is the parent company of ranch market 
in conjunction with this agreement  we issued  warrants to senior executives of ranch market to purchase common stock of the company at a price of per share 
these warrants vest over six years and are intended to provide direct benefit to ranch market executives who make a significant contribution to the success of the in store banking operations 
the estimated total fair value of the issued warrants was million 
as of december    warrants out of the  warrants initially issued have been exercised 
we have not experienced nor do we anticipate any material increases in overhead expenses or capital investments as a result of this agreement with ranch market 
in order to further align the interests of both parties  senior executives of ranch market have also made a significant investment in the company  including the purchase of  newly issued shares of east west bancorp  inc common stock totaling million in the shares were sold for cash at a price of per share 
no underwriting discounts or commissions were paid in connection with this transaction 
the shares were restricted 
upon the two year anniversary of the closing on august   of the shares became available for sale 
after each of the next three anniversaries  of the total shares became available for sale 
all shares can be freely traded on the fifth year anniversary 
the total estimated fair value of the purchased shares was million 
all of the  shares of restricted stock that were initially granted were fully vested as of december  risk based capital we are committed to maintaining capital at a level sufficient to assure our shareholders  our customers and our regulators that our company and our bank subsidiary are financially sound 
we are subject to risk based capital regulations adopted by the federal banking regulators in january these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures 
according to the regulations  institutions whose tier i and total capital ratios meet or exceed and  respectively  are deemed to be well capitalized 
at december   the bank s tier i and total capital ratios were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  at december  the following table compares east west bancorp  inc s and east west bank s actual capital ratios at december   to those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well capitalized classification purposes table regulatory required ratios minimum well east west east west regulatory capitalized bancorp bank requirements requirements total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets asset liability and market risk management liquidity liquidity management involves our ability to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and demands of daily operations  which include funding of securities purchases  providing for customers credit needs and ongoing repayment of borrowings 
our liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by the asset liability committee and the board of directors 
this process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet the needs of the bank  including adequate cash flow for off balance sheet instruments 
our primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities which include the acceptance of customer and brokered deposits  federal funds facilities  repurchase agreement facilities  advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco  and issuances of long term debt 
these funding sources are augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans  the routine liquidation of securities from the available for sale portfolio and securitizations of loans 
primary uses of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits  originations and purchases of loans  purchases of investment securities  and payment of operating expenses 
during the years ended december  and  we experienced net cash inflows of million and million  respectively  from operating activities 
net cash inflows from operating activities during and were primarily due to net income earned during the year 
net cash outflows from investing activities totaled billion and billion during and  respectively 
net cash outflows from investing activities for both periods can be attributed primarily to the substantial growth in our loan portfolio and purchases of available for sale securities 
these activities were partially offset by repayments  maturities  redemptions and net sales proceeds from investment securities 
we experienced net cash inflows from financing activities of billion during the year ended december   primarily due to deposit growth  proceeds from federal funds purchased  repurchase agreements  fhlb advances  and long term debt 
during  deposit growth  proceeds from federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements  and long term debt  partially offset by a decrease in fhlb advances  accounted for net cash inflows from financing activities totaling billion 
as a means of augmenting our liquidity  we have established federal funds lines with six correspondent banks and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies 
at december   the company s available borrowing capacity includes million in federal funds line facilities  million in repurchase arrangements and billion in unused fhlb advances 
we believe our liquidity sources to be stable and adequate 
at december   we are not aware of any information that was reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity position 
the liquidity of east west bancorp  inc is primarily dependent on the payment of cash dividends by its subsidiary  east west bank  subject to limitations imposed by the financial code of the state of california 
for the years ended december  and  total dividends paid by the bank to east west bancorp  inc amounted to million and million  respectively 
as of december   approximately million of undivided profits of the bank were available for dividends to the company 
interest rate sensitivity management our success is largely dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk  which is the impact of adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our net interest income and net portfolio value 
although in the normal course of business we manage other risks  such as credit and liquidity risk  we consider interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk and could potentially have the largest material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the fundamental objective of the asset liability management process is to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while maintaining adequate levels of liquidity and capital 
our strategy is formulated by the asset liability committee  which coordinates with the board of directors to monitor our overall asset and liability composition 
the committee meets regularly to evaluate  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses on the available for sale portfolio including those attributable to hedging transactions  if any  purchase and securitization activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
our overall strategy is to minimize the adverse impact of immediate incremental changes in market interest rates rate shock on net interest income and net portfolio value 
net portfolio value is defined as the present value of assets  minus the present value of liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the attainment of this goal requires a balance between profitability  liquidity and interest rate risk exposure 
to minimize the adverse impact of changes in market interest rates  we simulate the effect of instantaneous interest rate changes on net interest income and net portfolio value on a monthly basis 
the table below shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and market value of equity as of december  and  assuming a parallel shift of to basis points in both directions table rate shock table net interest income net portfolio value volatility volatility change in interest rates december  december  december  december  basis points the percentage change represents net interest income for twelve months in a stable interest rate environment versus net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change represents net portfolio value of the bank in a stable rate environment versus net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios 
all interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and related derivative contracts are included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis at december  and at december  and  our estimated changes in net interest income and net portfolio value were within the ranges established by the board of directors 
our primary analytical tool to gauge interest rate sensitivity is a simulation model used by many major banks and bank regulators  and is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model attempts to predict changes in the yields earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities in relation to changes in market interest rates 
as an enhancement to the primary simulation model  prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent broker dealer quotations  an independent pricing model and other available public sources are incorporated into the model 
adjustments are made to reflect the shift in the treasury and other appropriate yield curves 
the model also factors in projections of anticipated activity levels by product line and takes into account our increased ability to control rates offered on deposit products in comparison to our ability to control rates on adjustable rate loans tied to the published indices 
the following table provides the outstanding principal balances and the weighted average interest rates of our financial instruments as of december  the information presented below is based on the repricing date for variable rate instruments and the expected maturity date for fixed rate instruments 
table expected maturity for financial instruments expected maturity or repricing date by year fair value at after december  total dollars in thousands assets securities purchased under resale agreements weighted average rate investment securities available for sale fixed rate weighted average rate investment securities available for sale variable rate weighted average rate total gross loans weighted average rate liabilities checking accounts weighted average rate money market accounts weighted average rate savings deposits weighted average rate time deposits weighted average rate federal funds purchased weighted average rate fhlb overnight weighted average rate fhlb term weighted average rate securities sold under repurchase agreements weighted average rate subordinated debt weighted average rate junior subordinated debt weighted average rate fixed rate junior subordinated debt weighted average rate variable rate includes hybrid securities that have fixed interest rates for the first three or five years 
thereafter  interest rates become adjustable based on a predetermined index 
expected maturities of assets are contractual maturities adjusted for projected payment based on contractual amortization and unscheduled prepayments of principal as well as repricing frequency 
expected maturities for deposits are based on contractual maturities adjusted for projected rollover rates and changes in pricing for deposits with no stated maturity dates 
we utilize assumptions supported by documented analyses for the expected maturities of our loans and repricing of our deposits 
we also rely on third party data providers for prepayment projections for amortizing securities 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary significantly if future prepayments and repricing differ from our expectations based on historical experience 
the fair values of short term investments approximate their book values due to their short maturities 
for securities purchased under resale agreements  fair values are calculated by discounting future cash flows based on expected maturities or repricing dates utilizing estimated market discount rates 
bid quotations from securities brokers or third party data providers are the basis for fair values of investment securities available for sale 
the fair values of loans are estimated for portfolios with similar financial characteristics and takes into consideration discounted cash flows based on expected maturities or repricing dates utilizing estimated market discount rates as projected by third party data providers 
transaction deposit accounts  which include checking  money market and savings accounts  are presumed to have equal book and fair values because the interest rates paid on these accounts are based on prevailing market rates 
the fair values of time deposits are based upon the discounted values of contractual cash flows  which are estimated using current rates offered for deposits of similar remaining terms 
for federal funds purchased  fair value approximates book value due to their short maturities 
the fair value of fhlb advances is estimated by discounting the cash flows through maturity or the next repricing date based on current rates offered by the fhlb for borrowings with similar maturities 
the fair values of securities sold under repurchase agreements are calculated by discounting future cash flows based on expected maturities or repricing dates  utilizing estimated market discount rates and taking into consideration the call features of each instrument 
for both subordinated and junior subordinated debt instruments  fair values are estimated by discounting cash flows through maturity based on current market rates 
the asset liability committee is authorized to utilize a wide variety of off balance sheet financial techniques to assist in the management of interest rate risk 
we sometimes use derivative financial instruments as part of our asset and liability management strategy  with the overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest margin and stockholders equity 
the use of derivatives has not had a material effect on our operating results or financial position 
in august and november  we entered into four equity swap agreements with a major investment brokerage firm to hedge against market fluctuations in a promotional equity index certificate of deposit product that we offered to bank customers for a limited time during the latter half of this product  which has a term of years  pays interest based on the performance of the hang seng china enterprises index  or the hscei 
the combined notional amounts of the equity swap agreements total million with termination dates similar to the stated maturity date on the underlying certificate of deposit host contracts 
for the equity swap agreements  we agreed to pay interest based on the one month libor minus a spread on a monthly basis and receive any increase in the hscei at swap termination date 
under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  a certificate of deposit that pays interest based on changes in an equity index is a hybrid instrument with an embedded derivative ie equity call option that must be accounted for separately from the host contract ie the certificate of deposit 
in accordance with sfas no 
 both the embedded equity call options on the certificates of deposit and the freestanding equity swap agreements are marked to market every month with resulting changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
on april   the company amended the four equity swap agreements entered into in effectively removing the swap payable leg 
the amendments to the swap agreements changed the terms of the agreements such that instead of paying interest based on the one month libor minus a spread on a monthly basis for the remaining terms of the agreements  we prepaid this amount based on the current market value of the cash streams 
the total amount paid in conjunction with these swap agreement amendments was million on april  the fair values of both the embedded derivatives and equity swap agreements amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the embedded derivatives are included in interest bearing deposits and the equity swap agreements are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of the derivative contracts are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the change in value of the hscei based upon the life of the individual swap agreement 
the significant increase in the fair value of the derivative contracts since december  can be attributed to a rise in the index value combined with a increase in the implied volatility of the hscei call options as of december   relative to year end item a
