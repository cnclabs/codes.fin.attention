critical accounting policies general the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
we use historical loss data  peer group experience and the economic environment as factors  among others  in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan and lease portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use 
other estimates that we use are related to the expected useful lives of our depreciable assets 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is an estimate of the credit loss risk in our loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when it is probable that a loss has occurred at the balance sheet date and such loss can be reasonably estimated  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued on impaired loans based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual risk  loss events  or changes in other factors  occur 
the analysis of the allowance uses an historical loss view as an indicator of future losses and as a result could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
however  since our analysis of risk and loss potential is updated regularly  the errors that might otherwise occur are mitigated 
if the allowance for loan and lease losses falls below that deemed adequate by reason of loan and lease growth  actual losses  the effect of changes in risk ratings  or some combination of these factors  the company has a strategy for supplementing the allowance for loan and lease losses  over the short term 
for further information regarding our allowance for loan and lease losses  see allowance for loan and lease losses activity discussion later in this item stock based compensation the company previously accounted for its stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
because the company s stock option plan provides for the issuance of options at a price of no less than the fair market value at the date of the grant  no compensation expense was recognized in the financial statements unless the options were modified after the grant date 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement number revised fas r  share based payments 
fas r requires all entities to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments such as stock options granted to employees 
the company adopted fas r on a modified prospective method  beginning on january  under this method  the company is required to record compensation expense as previous awards continue to vest for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
as a result of adopting statement r on january   the company s income before provision for income taxes and net income for the year ended december   was  and  lower  respectively  than if it had continued to account for share based compensation under apb opinion no 
diluted earnings per share and basic earnings per share for the year ended december  would have increased and  respectively  had the company continued to account for share based compensation under apb opinion no 
the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant and amortized over the service period using an option pricing model 
critical assumptions that affect the estimated fair value of each option include expected stock price volatility  dividend yields  option life and the risk free interest rate 
goodwill business combinations involving the company s acquisition of the equity interests or net assets of another enterprise or the assumption of net liabilities in an acquisition of branches constituting a business may give rise to goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the value of goodwill is ultimately derived from the company s ability to generate net earnings after the acquisition 
a decline in net earnings could be indicative of a decline in the fair value of goodwill and result in impairment 
for that reason  goodwill is assessed for impairment at a reporting unit level at least annually following the year of acquisition 
the company performed an evaluation of the goodwill  recorded as a result of the bank of amador acquisition  during the fourth quarter of and determined that there was no impairment 
while the company believes all assumptions utilized in its assessment of goodwill for impairment are reasonable and appropriate  changes in earnings  the effective tax rate  historical earnings multiples and the cost of capital could all cause different results for the calculation of the present value of future cash flows

additionally  the average loan growth in increased in part due to the addition of the bank of amador loans at the end of risk elements the company assesses and manages credit risk on an ongoing basis through a total credit culture that emphasizes excellent credit quality  extensive internal monitoring and established formal lending policies 
additionally  the company contracts with an outside loan review consultant to periodically review the existing loan and lease portfolio 
management believes its ability to identify and assess risk and return characteristics of the company s loan and lease portfolio is critical for profitability and growth 
management strives to continue its emphasis on credit quality in the loan and lease approval process  active credit administration and regular monitoring 
with this in mind  management has designed and implemented a comprehensive loan and lease review and grading system that functions to continually assess the credit risk inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
ultimately  underlying trends in economic and business cycles may influence credit quality 
american river bank s business is concentrated in the sacramento metropolitan statistical area  which is a diversified economy  but with a large state of california government presence and employment base  in sonoma county  through north coast bank  a division of american river bank  whose business is focused on businesses within the three communities in which it has offices santa rosa  windsor  and healdsburg and in amador county  through bank of amador  a division of american river bank  whose business is focused on businesses and consumers within the three communities in which it has offices jackson  pioneer  and ione as well as a diversified residential construction loan business in numerous northern california counties

the company has significant extensions of credit and commitments to extend credit that are secured by real estate 
the ultimate repayment of these loans is generally dependent on personal or business cash flows or the sale or refinancing of the real estate 
the company monitors the effects of current and expected market conditions and other factors on the collectability of real estate loans 
the more significant factors management considers involve the following lease rate and terms  absorption and sale rates  real estate values and rates of return  operating expenses  inflation  and sufficiency of repayment sources independent of the real estate including  in some instances  personal guarantees 
in extending credit and commitments to borrowers  the company generally requires collateral and or guarantees as security 
the repayment of such loans is expected to come from cash flow or from proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers 
the company s requirement for collateral and or guarantees is determined on a case by case basis in connection with management s evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing properties  residences and other real property 
the company secures its collateral by perfecting its security interest in business assets  obtaining deeds of trust  or outright possession among other means 
in management s judgment  a concentration exists in real estate loans which represented approximately of the company s loan and lease portfolio at december   down from at december  although management believes this concentration to have no more than the normal risk of collectability  a substantial decline in the economy in general  or a decline in real estate values in the company s primary market areas in particular  could have an adverse impact on the collectability of these loans and require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses which could adversely affect the company s future prospects  results of operations  profitability and stock price 
management believes that its lending policies and underwriting standards will tend to minimize losses in an economic downturn  however  there is no assurance that losses will not occur under such circumstances 
the company s loan policies and underwriting standards include  but are not limited to  the following maintaining a thorough understanding of the company s service area and originating a significant majority of its loans within that area  maintaining a thorough understanding of borrowers knowledge  capacity  and market position in their field of expertise  basing real estate loan approvals not only on market demand for the project  but also on the borrowers capacity to support the project financially in the event it does not perform to expectations whether sale or income performance  and maintaining conforming and prudent loan to value and loan to cost ratios based on independent outside appraisals and ongoing inspection and analysis by the company s lending officers or contracted third party professionals 
nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans and leases management generally places loans and leases on nonaccrual status when they become days past due  unless the loan or lease is well secured and in the process of collection 
loans and leases are charged off when  in the opinion of management  collection appears unlikely 
the recorded investments in nonaccrual loans and leases and loans that were accrued and days or more past due totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
the related allowance for losses for these loans and leases at december  and december  was  and  respectively

allowance for loan and lease losses activity the company maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses alll to cover probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio  which is based upon management s estimated range of those losses 
the alll is established through a provision for loan and lease losses and is increased by provisions charged against current earnings and recoveries and reduced by charge offs 
actual losses for loans and leases can vary significantly from this estimate 
the methodology and assumptions used to calculate the allowance are continually reviewed as to their appropriateness given the most recent losses realized and other factors that influence the estimation process 
the model assumptions and resulting allowance level are adjusted accordingly as these factors change 
the adequacy of the alll and the level of the related provision for loan and lease losses is determined based on management s judgment after consideration of numerous factors including but not limited to i local and regional economic conditions  ii borrowers financial condition  iii loan impairment and the related level of expected charge offs  iv evaluation of industry trends  v industry and other concentrations  vi loans and leases which are contractually current as to payment terms but demonstrate a higher degree of risk as identified by management  vii continuing evaluations of the performing loan portfolio  viii ongoing review and evaluation of problem loans identified as having loss potential  ix quarterly review by the board of directors  and x assessments by banking regulators and other third parties 
management and the board of directors evaluate the alll and determine its appropriate level considering objective and subjective measures  such as knowledge of the borrowers business  valuation of collateral  the determination of impaired loans or leases and exposure to potential losses 
the company establishes general reserves in accordance with statement of accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and specific reserves in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the alll is maintained by categories of the loan and lease portfolio based on loan type and loan rating  however  the entire allowance is available to cover actual loan and lease losses 
while management uses available information to recognize possible losses on loans and leases  future additions to the allowance may be necessary  based on changes in economic conditions and other matters 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s alll 
such agencies may require the company to provide additions to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination

based on information currently available to analyze inherent credit risk  including economic factors  overall credit quality  historical delinquencies and a history of actual charge offs  management believes that the provision for loan and lease losses and the allowance for loan and lease losses are prudent and adequate 
adjustments may be made based on differences from estimated loan and lease growth  the types of loans constituting this growth  changes in risk ratings within the portfolio  and general economic conditions 
however  no prediction of the ultimate level of loans and leases charged off in future periods can be made with any certainty 
as part of its loan review process  management has allocated the overall allowance based on specific identified problem loans and leases  qualitative factors  uncertainty inherent in the estimation process and historical loss data 
a risk exists that future losses cannot be precisely quantified or attributed to particular loans or leases or classes of loans and leases 
management continues to evaluate the loan and lease portfolio and assesses current economic conditions that will affect management s conclusion as to future allowance levels 
table ten below summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for the five years ended december  the allocation presented should not be interpreted as an indication that charges to the allowance for loan and lease losses will be incurred in these amounts or proportions  or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each loan and lease category represents the total amounts available for charge offs that may occur within these categories

capital resources the current and projected capital position of the company and the impact of capital plans and long term strategies is reviewed regularly by management 
the company s capital position represents the level of capital available to support continuing operations and expansion 
on september   the company announced a plan to repurchase  as conditions warrant  up to annually of the company s common stock 
each year the company may repurchase up to of the shares outstanding adjusted for stock splits or stock dividends 
the repurchases are to be made from time to time in the open market as conditions allow and will be structured to comply with commission rule b management reports monthly to the board of directors on the status of the repurchase program

the company and american river bank are subject to certain regulatory capital requirements administered by the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the federal deposit insurance corporation 
failure to meet these minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory  and possibly additional discretionary  actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s and american river bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors

market risk management overview 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its loan and deposit functions 
the goal for managing the assets and liabilities of the company is to maximize shareholder value and earnings while maintaining a high quality balance sheet without exposing the company to undue interest rate risk 
the board of directors has overall responsibility for the interest rate risk management policies 
the company has a risk management committee that establishes and monitors guidelines to control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
asset liability management 
activities involved in asset liability management include  but are not limited to  lending  accepting and placing deposits and investing in securities 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk associated with asset liability management 
sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes arises when yields on assets change in a different time period or in a different amount from that of interest costs on liabilities 
to mitigate interest rate risk  the structure of the consolidated balance sheet is managed with the goal that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities are correlated and contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates 
the asset liability management policy sets limits on the acceptable amount of variance in net interest margin and market value of equity under changing interest environments 
the company uses simulation models to forecast earnings  net interest margin and market value of equity 
simulation of earnings is the primary tool used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes 
using computer modeling techniques  the company is able to estimate the potential impact of changing interest rates on earnings 
a balance sheet forecast is prepared quarterly using inputs of actual loans and leases  securities and interest bearing liabilities ie deposits borrowings positions as the beginning base 
the forecast balance sheet is processed against three interest rate scenarios 
the scenarios include a basis point rising rate forecast  a flat rate forecast and a basis point falling rate forecast which take place within a one year time frame 
the net interest income is measured during the year assuming a gradual change in rates over the twelve month horizon 
the simulation modeling indicated below attempts to estimate changes in the company s net interest income utilizing a forecast balance sheet projected from year end balances 
table twelve below summarizes the effect on net interest income nii of a basis point change in interest rates as measured against a constant rate no change scenario 
caption table twelve interest rate risk simulation of net interest as of december  dollars in thousands change in nii from current month horizon variation from a constant rate scenario 
del bp bp del 
the simulations of earnings do not incorporate any management actions  which might moderate the negative consequences of interest rate deviations 
therefore  they do not reflect likely actual results  but serve as reasonable estimates of interest rate risk 
interest rate sensitivity analysis interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the portfolio of assets and liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity of assets and liabilities and their repricing during periods of changes in market interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities in the current portfolio that are subject to repricing at various time horizons 
the differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps 
table thirteen below lists the maturity or repricing time buckets as of december  caption table thirteen interest rate sensitivity december  assets and liabilities which mature or reprice within days non dollars in thousands over repricing total

a positive cumulative gap may be equated to an asset sensitive position 
an asset sensitive position in a rising interest rate environment will cause a bank s interest rate margin to expand 
this results as floating or variable rate loans reprice more rapidly than fixed rate certificates of deposit that reprice as they mature over time 
conversely  a declining interest rate environment will cause the opposite effect 
a negative cumulative gap may be equated to a liability sensitive position 
a liability sensitive position in a rising interest rate environment will cause a bank s interest rate margin to contract  while a declining interest rate environment will have the opposite effect 
as reflected in table thirteen  at december   the cumulative gap through the one year time horizon indicates a liability sensitive position 
inflation the impact of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly from that exerted on manufacturing  or other commercial concerns  primarily because its assets and liabilities are largely monetary 
in general  inflation primarily affects the company through its effect on market rates of interest  which affects the company s ability to attract loan customers 
inflation affects the growth of total assets by increasing the level of loan demand  and potentially adversely affects capital adequacy because loan growth in inflationary periods can increase at rates higher than the rate that capital grows through retention of earnings which may be generated in the future 
in addition to its effects on interest rates  inflation increases overall operating expenses 
inflation has not had a material effect upon the results of operations of the company during the years ended december   and liquidity liquidity management refers to the company s ability to provide funds on an ongoing basis to meet fluctuations in deposit levels as well as the credit needs and requirements of its clients 
both assets and liabilities contribute to the company s liquidity position 
federal funds lines  short term investments and securities  and loan and lease repayments contribute to liquidity  along with deposit increases  while loan and lease funding and deposit withdrawals decrease liquidity 
the company assesses the likelihood of projected funding requirements by reviewing historical funding patterns  current and forecasted economic conditions and individual client funding needs 
commitments to fund loans and outstanding standby letters of credit at december  were approximately  and  respectively 
such loan commitments relate primarily to revolving lines of credit and other commercial loans and to real estate construction loans 
since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company s sources of liquidity consist of cash and due from correspondent banks  overnight funds sold to correspondent banks  unpledged marketable investments and loans held for sale 
on december   consolidated liquid assets totaled million or of total assets compared to million or of total assets on december  in addition to liquid assets  the company maintains short term lines of credit in the amount of  with correspondent banks 
at december   the company had  available under these credit lines 
additionally  american river bank is a member of the fhlb 
at december   american river bank could have arranged for up to  in secured borrowings from the fhlb 
these borrowings are secured by pledged mortgage loans and investment securities 
at december   the company had  available under these secured borrowing arrangements 
american river bank also has informal agreements with various other banks to sell participations in loans  if necessary 
the company serves primarily a business and professional customer base and  as such  its deposit base is susceptible to economic fluctuations 
accordingly  management strives to maintain a balanced position of liquid assets to volatile and cyclical deposits 
liquidity is also affected by portfolio maturities and the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the marketability of both assets and liabilities 
the company can sell any of its unpledged securities held in the available for sale category to meet liquidity needs 
these securities are also available to pledge as collateral for borrowings if the need should arise 
american river bank has established a master repurchase agreement with a correspondent bank to enable such transactions 
american river bank can also pledge securities to borrow from the frb and the fhlb 
the principal cash requirements of the company are for expenses incurred in the support of administration and operations 
for nonbanking functions  the company is dependent upon the payment of cash dividends from its subsidiaries to service its commitments 
the company expects that the cash dividends paid by american river bank to the company will be sufficient to meet this payment schedule 
the maturity distribution of certificates of deposit is set forth in table fourteen below for the periods presented 
these deposits are generally more rate sensitive than other deposits and  therefore  are more likely to be withdrawn to obtain higher yields elsewhere if available

off balance sheet arrangements the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
these financial instruments consist of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet 
as of december   commitments to extend credit and letters of credit were the only financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
the company has not entered into any contracts for financial derivative instruments such as futures  swaps  options or similar instruments 
real estate commitments are generally secured by property with a loan to value ratio of to 
in addition  the majority of the company s commitments have variable interest rates 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments

certain financial institutions have elected to use special purpose vehicles spv to dispose of problem assets 
the spv is typically a subsidiary company with an asset and liability structure and legal status that makes its obligations secure even if the parent corporation goes bankrupt 
under certain circumstances  these financial institutions may exclude the problem assets from their reported impaired and non performing assets 
the company does not use those vehicles or any other structures to dispose of problem assets
