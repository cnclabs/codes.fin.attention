item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a genetics company committed to providing genetic analysis products and services that translate genomic science into superior solutions for biomedical research  agricultural  molecular medicine applications and diagnostic applications including non invasive prenatal diagnostics 
our proprietary massarray system  comprised of hardware  software applications  consumable chips and reagents  is a high performance nucleic acid analysis platform that quantitatively and precisely measures genetic target material and variations therein 
in late  we launched our services business  which provides genetic analysis services to customers as a complement and as an alternative to our systems product offerings 
our research and development efforts are committed to producing new and improved applications for our massarray system that will deliver greater system versatility and also reduce the cost per data point generated 
our research and development efforts are also directed to the development of diagnostic tests  particularly non invasive prenatal diagnostics  for use on the massarray system and potentially other platforms 
we derive revenue primarily from sales of our massarray hardware  software and consumable products 
our standard massarray system combines four basic components proprietary analytical reaction technology and sample preparation and dispensing hardware to prepare dna for analysis  a coated silicon chip known as the spectrochip bioarray  a mass spectrometer  which uses an established analytical method that we have adapted for dna analysis  and bioinformatics software that records  calculates  and reports the data generated by the mass spectrometer 
each of these components contributes to a high level of performance in terms of speed  accuracy  and cost efficiency 
we have been selling massarray products since our massarray technology is accepted as a leading high performance dna analysis system for the fine mapping genotyping market 
our list of customers includes clinical research laboratories  biotechnology companies  and government agencies 
to maximize market penetration and provide customer support for our expanding user base  we have established direct sales and support personnel serving north america  europe and asia  in addition to regional distribution partners in france  india  israel  japan  korea  new zealand  singapore  taiwan  and turkey 
genetic analysis is primarily conducted in two key biomedical research market sectors the academic research market  where we currently focus  and the clinical analysis market  where we are expanding 
the research market is a relatively small market and is mainly comprised of academic institutions  which make initial 
table of contents genetic discoveries 
however  it is the source of discoveries of new genetic content 
the clinical analysis market is significantly larger and takes the genetic analysis a step further to establish the use of genes and genetic markers for the potential benefit of the general population 
the needs of these markets differ significantly 
the academic research market  which requires the highest data density per sample  is more tolerant to inconsistencies in data and error rates  and typically has a shorter window of opportunity 
sample throughput is very high 
the academic research market is extremely price competitive 
the clinical analysis market is typically interested in a defined number of markers per sample  is not as tolerant to inconsistencies and error rates  typically has a longer development cycle  and is less price competitive 
sample throughput requirements are not nearly as high 
considering the clinical analysis market s requirements and the strengths of the massarray system  including its high sensitivity  specificity  and reproducibility  we believe there is significant opportunity to be more competitive in the clinical analysis market 
we have targeted customers conducting quality genotyping and performing fine mapping studies  candidate gene studies  comparative sequencing  gene expression analysis  and epigenetic analysis the analysis of dna methylation  in the molecular medicine market 
we also plan to broaden the markets to which we sell our product line 
we have identified four target segments for potential growth clinical research and clinical marker validation  the emerging field of molecular medicine  diagnostic service laboratories  and animal testing laboratories 
as of december   our revenues consisted of sales of massarray hardware  software  consumables  maintenance agreements  and from services contracts through our genetic analysis services business 
the impact of our massarray compact system  our iplex and iplex gold assays  other new products and product applications and our services business on future revenues  margins  expenses  and cash flows remains uncertain and depends on many factors as described in item a of this report under the caption risk factors 
we expect revenues from out licensing and commercialization of our non invasive prenatal diagnostics technology  including technology for rhesus d incompatibility using a real time polymerase chain reaction platform  to be minimal for the foreseeable future 
we also expect revenues from our out licensing and commercialization efforts with respect to our prior disease gene discoveries to be minimal for the foreseeable future 
to the extent that revenues are realized from our non invasive prenatal diagnostics technology or from our prior disease gene discoveries  if at all  they may fluctuate significantly as revenues will be based upon the occurrence of certain milestones  our reliance upon and the progress made by our collaborative partners  successful product development and commercialization  and product demand  all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict 
as a result  our entitlement to  and the timing and amounts of  any licensing and milestone payments and royalty or revenue sharing payments on future product sales are uncertain and difficult to predict 
to achieve such revenues we will likely be dependent upon the efforts  resources and success of present and future collaborators and licensees who may need to invest significant dollar amounts in research and development efforts  commercialization efforts  clinical trials  and obtaining regulatory approvals over several years 
such revenues  if any  are uncertain and also depend on many factors as described in item a of this report under the caption risk factors 
we have a history of recurring losses from operations and have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  our capital requirements to sustain operations  including research and development projects  have been and will continue to be significant 
as of december   we had available cash and short term investments totaling million and working capital of million 
in june  we closed a private placement financing that provided us with approximately million of net proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
certain of these accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to our investors understanding of our financial results and condition are discussed below 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in preparing these financial statements  management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we follow the provisions as set forth by current accounting rules  which primarily include the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
in accordance with sab no 
 revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we consider eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and for massarray system sales  the arrangement consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
the separate units of accounting are typically the system and software itself and maintenance contracts sold at the time of the system sale 
revenue is deferred for fees received before earned 
revenues from sales of consumables are recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer 
revenue from sales of massarray systems with standard payment terms of net days are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer or when all revenue recognition criteria are met 
our contracts do not contain refund or cancellation clauses 
revenues from the sale or licensing of our proprietary software are recognized upon transfer of title to the customer or the duration of the software license 
we recognize revenue on maintenance services for ongoing customer support over the maintenance period 
revenues from genetic services are recognized at the completion of key stages in the performance of the service  which is generally delivery of snp assay information 
grant revenue is recorded as the research expenses relating to the grants are incurred  provided that the amounts received are not refundable if the research is not successful 
amounts received that are refundable if the research is not successful would be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon the grantor s acceptance of the success of the research results 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates are as follows accrued acquisition and integration costs 
to the extent that exact amounts were not determinable at the time of acquisition  we estimated amounts for direct costs of the acquisition of gemini genomics and axiom biotechnologies and the related integration costs in accordance with eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination and sfas no 
 business combinations 
amounts accrued relating to acquisition and integration costs totaled million and as of december  approximately million remained accrued 
the amount accrued at december  represents our remaining lease payments  net of estimated sublease income of million from existing subleased space 
if we do not receive all the amounts due to us under non cancelable subleases  we will incur additional expense 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically re evaluate the original assumptions and rationale utilized in the establishment of the carrying value and estimated lives of our long lived assets 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate income from operations and positive cash flows in future periods as well as the strategic significance of any intangible assets in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
an impairment charge of million related to intangible assets acquired from axiom  which were determined to have no alternative future use was recorded in following the closure of our internal drug discovery program 
no impairment of long lived assets was recorded in or intangible assets totaled million  net of accumulated amortization  at december  reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
we operate in an industry characterized by rapid improvements and changes to technology and products 
the introduction of new products by us or our competitors can result in our inventory being rendered obsolete or requiring us to sell items at a discount to cost 
we estimate the recoverability of our inventory by reference to our internal estimates of future demands and product life cycles 
if we incorrectly forecast demand for our products or inadequately manage the introduction of new product lines  we could materially impact our financial statements by having excess inventory on hand 
our future estimates are subjective and could be incorrect 
during  slow moving inventory reserves of million were offset against cost of goods sold  and the total reserve was million at december  new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin no 
requires that we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin no 
are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the interpretation and do not expect the adoption of fin no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in september  the sec issued sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  which provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after november  we do not expect the adoption of sab no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies only to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and revenues total revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
massarray and other product related revenues are derived from the sale of massarray systems  consumables  sales and licensing of our proprietary software  maintenance contracts  and license fees from end users 
consumable sales increased to million in from million in the increase in compared to was a result of an increase in our installed base of massarray compact systems as well as demand for our iplex assay 
massarray and other product related revenue increased to million in from million in the increase of million was primarily due to an increase in massarray system hardware and software sales to million in from million in revenue from other product sales  including massarray system maintenance contracts  license fees and royalties  for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had shipped inventory  consisting primarily of hardware  with a cost of million to certain customers in respect of purchase orders or contracts received which did not meet our criteria for revenue recognition 
we recognized million of revenue in respect of these shipments upon receipt of payment from or delivery of software products to these customers during the year ended december  we recorded genetic analysis service revenues of million for the year ended december  we recorded no service revenues for the year ended december  we expect service revenues to continue to increase during research and other revenue was million in and during the year ended december   we recognized million of revenue related to the license of certain proprietary genetic content to a third party 
the timing of research revenues depends upon our expenditures on grant research and the receipt of the grant funding from the sponsoring agencies 
we expect grant revenue to be minimal going forward 
domestic and non us revenues were million and million  respectively  for the year ended december and million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  our revenues have historically fluctuated from period to period and likely will continue to fluctuate substantially in the future based upon the unpredictable sales cycle for the massarray compact system  revenue recognition criteria  and the overall acceptance and demand for our new and existing commercial products and services 
cost of product and service revenues and gross margins cost of product revenues were and million and gross margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross margins primarily increased due to lower charges to obsolescence reserves resulting from improvement in inventory management 
we believe that gross margin in future periods will be affected by  among other things  the selling price for systems and consumables  consumable sales per massarray system sold  the mix of products sold  competitive conditions  sales volumes  discounts offered  inventory reserves and obsolescence charges required and royalty payment obligations on in licensed technologies 
cost of service revenues were million and gross margins were  respectively  for the year ended december  there were no service revenues or cost of service revenues for the year ended december  gross margins are dependent on the particular service contract terms of the work undertaken in each year 

table of contents research and development costs research and development costs were million for both years ended december  and these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  improvements to our existing products  validation of products under development  and expenses relating to work performed under research contracts 
research and development expenses in compared to were primarily affected by increased operating supplies of million and consultant and collaboration costs of million related to our non invasive prenatal technology development and massarray product development 
these increases were offset by reductions in headcount costs of million and allocated costs of million 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase during as we increase our investment in the development of non invasive prenatal nucleic acid based tests and as we continue to invest in new products and applications for our massarray platform 
sales and marketing costs sales and marketing costs were million for both years ended december  and these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for sales and marketing  customer support  and business development personnel and their related department expenses 
sales and marketing expenses in compared to were primarily affected by increased costs of million related to the establishment of a sales office in china  legal costs of million and share based payments and other costs of million 
these increases were offset by reductions in headcount costs of million  allocated expenses of million and public relations expenses of million 
we expect our sales and marketing headcount and associated expense to increase in as we strengthen our sales force for our massarray system and as we build our commercial development team for our non invasive prenatal nucleic acid based tests 
general and administrative costs general and administrative costs were million for both of the years ended december  and these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for legal  finance  and human resource personnel  and their related department expenses 
general and administrative expenses in compared to were primarily affected by increased share based payments of million  bad debt expense of million and allocated costs of million 
these increases were partially offset by reduced headcount costs of million and lower insurance costs due to reduced premiums of million 
we expect general and administrative costs to increase in  compared to as we build our infrastructure in order to support our anticipated growth 
asset impairment and restructuring charges during the third quarter of  we introduced a cost reduction plan  which included a reduction of existing headcount by approximately across all departments by the end of we incurred a charge of million in relating to severance and related expenses in connection with this headcount reduction 
at december   we had an accrued balance of million in respect of the restructuring charges representing the remaining payout of severance costs 
we paid the remaining amounts due during 
table of contents during the third quarter of  we closed our sequenom pharmaceuticals business segment 
during the first quarter of  we sold certain tangible assets and recovered million in excess of the carrying value  which we had previously fully provided for as part of the restructuring charge 
amortization of acquired intangibles in connection with the acquisition of gemini genomics  plc in  we acquired approximately million of intangible assets  including clinical data collections and patent rights 
our intangible assets are being amortized over three to five years 
the and amortization charges of million and million  respectively  represents the amortization of all these assets held throughout the respective year 
interest income interest income was million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the increased cash balance as a result of our private placement of common stock and warrants in june interest expense interest expense was  in compared to million in the decreases resulted from our lower level of borrowings as we paid off our capital leases 
in december  we paid the remaining balance of million under our credit facility with a financial institution 
as a result  our interest expense declined in deferred income tax benefit the deferred tax benefit of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  were primarily due to the amortization on the intangible assets  including clinical data collections and patent rights  acquired from gemini genomics 
at december   we had federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in unless previously utilized 
approximately million of the state tax loss carryforwards will expire in and the state tax loss carry forwards will continue to expire in unless previously utilized 
we incurred a federal and state capital loss on the disposal of two of our foreign subsidiaries in totaling million 
the capital loss carryforward will expire in we also have german and united kingdom uk net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which may be carried forward indefinitely 
we also have federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in unless previously utilized 
pursuant to internal revenue code sections and  use of our federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited due to a cumulative change in ownership of more than within a three year period 
years ended december  and revenues total revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
consumable sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease in consumables revenue in  compared to was a result of a decline in our average selling prices and volumes for our spectrochip bioarray chips and other consumables 
massarray and other product related revenue increased to million in from million in the increase of million was primarily due to an increase in massarray system hardware and software sales to million in from million in revenue from other product sales  including 
table of contents massarray system maintenance contracts  license fees and royalties  for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had shipped inventory  consisting primarily of hardware  with a cost of million to certain customers in respect of purchase orders or contracts received which did not meet our criteria for revenue recognition 
we recognized million of revenue in respect of these shipments upon receipt of payment from or delivery of software products to these customers during research revenue decreased from million in to million in we performed more work on our grants in as our largest collaborator began to transfer samples to us for investigation 
the timing of research revenues depends upon our expenditures on grant research and the receipt of the grant funding from the sponsoring agencies 
domestic and non us revenues were million and million  respectively  for the year ended december and million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  our distribution contract with one asia based distributor  representing million of revenue in  expired on december  revenue for this same distributor was million in cost of product and service revenues and gross margins cost of product revenues were million and million and gross margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  higher margin consumables constituted of the mix of products sold  down from in  while lower margin hardware sales increased to in from in this change in product mix resulted in lower overall margins in  as compared to cost of service revenues were million and gross margins were for the year ended december  there were no service revenues or cost of service revenues for the year ended december  gross margins are dependent on the particular service contract terms of the work undertaken in each year 
research and development costs research and development costs decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  improvements to our existing products and validation of products under development  expenses relating to work performed under research contracts  and  prior to the termination of our internal drug discovery activities in july of  expenses related to our disease gene discovery and development programs 
the reduction in costs from to of million resulted from a reduction in operating supplies of million following the closure of our disease gene discovery program in july  million in depreciation as assets reached the end of their useful life  and million in headcount related costs due to headcount reduction 
these decreases were offset by million of expenses associated with the acquisition of the non invasive prenatal intellectual property rights from isis innovation ltd 
in october sales and marketing costs sales and marketing costs decreased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for sales and marketing  customer support  and business development personnel and their related department expenses 
the decrease in expense of million from to was primarily due to reduction in foreign selling expenses of million following a reduction in headcount in  reduced consulting costs of million as 
table of contents consulting projects were eliminated  increased absorption into cost of goods sold of million  and reduced travel costs of million 
these reductions were offset by increased us headcount related expenses of million 
general and administrative costs general and administrative costs decreased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for legal  finance  and human resource personnel  and their related department expenses 
the decrease from to of million related to cost savings in legal fees of million due to reduced patent portfolio expenses  decreased building operating costs of million  increased absorption into cost of goods sold of million  and lower insurance costs due to reduced premiums of million 
these reductions were offset by increased headcount costs of million  increased property taxes of million  and other expenses of million 
asset impairment and restructuring charges during the third quarter of  we introduced a cost reduction plan  which included a reduction of existing headcount by approximately across all departments by the end of we incurred a charge of million in relating to severance and related expenses in connection with this headcount reduction 
we terminated our internal drug discovery efforts during the third quarter of  which reduced our headcount by approximately by the end of during  we incurred total charges of million related to the closure of these activities 
of the million charge  million related to non cash charges from the write off of million on equipment taken out of service  million related to intangible assets of no value to our ongoing business and million related to employee severance costs and other contractual obligations 
during the first quarter of  we sold certain tangible assets and recovered million in excess of the carrying value  which we had previously fully provided for as part of the restructuring charge 
amortization of acquired intangibles in connection with the acquisition of gemini genomics  plc in  we acquired approximately million of intangible assets  including clinical data collections and patent rights 
our intangible assets are being amortized over three to five years 
the and amortization charges of million and million  respectively  represents the amortization of all these assets held throughout the respective year 
the reduction in expense is primarily due to an adjustment to the carrying value of assets related to the gemini acquisition of million in interest income interest income was million in  compared to million in the decrease resulted from lower interest rates and lower average balances of interest bearing investments 
interest expense interest expense was million in  compared to million in the decrease resulted from our lower level of borrowings as we paid off our capital leases 
in december  we paid the remaining balance of million under our credit facility with a financial institution 
deferred income tax benefit the deferred tax benefit of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  were due to the amortization on the intangible assets  including clinical data collections and patent rights  acquired from gemini genomics 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash totaled million  compared to million at december  our cash reserves are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including auction rate securities and money market accounts 
we have a history of recurring losses from operations and have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  our capital requirements to sustain operations  including research and development projects  have been and will continue to be significant 
as of december   we had available cash and short term investments totaling million and working capital of million 
as of december   we had available cash and short term investments of million and working capital of million 
through december   we funded our capital requirements primarily with the net proceeds of our initial public offering of common stock of approximately million  with private placements of equity securities of approximately million  and with million from the acquisition of gemini genomics in in june  we closed a private placement financing that provided us with approximately million of net proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock 
we consider the material drivers of our cash flow to be sales volumes  inventory management and operating expenses 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash used in operations for year ended december  was million compared to million for the use of cash was primarily a result of the net loss of million for year ended december   increased by million of deferred income tax benefit  an increase in accounts receivable balances of million due to timing of sales activity  and a million reduction in other liabilities 
cash usages were partially offset by non cash depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation of million  deferred rent of million  other non cash items of million  reductions of million in inventory levels from inventory management and valuation reserves  and increases in accounts payable and deferred income of million 
at our current and anticipated level of operating loss  we expect to continue to incur an operating cash outflow on a quarterly basis for the foreseeable future 
investing activities  other than the changes in our short term investments and restricted cash  used million in cash during the year ended december  compared to million for the same period of related to the purchases of capital equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december  compared to million used by financing activities for the same period in financing activities during the year ended december  included net receipts of million from the issuance of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock  partially offset by net payments of million for long term debt and capital lease obligations 
the following table summarized our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years after years open purchase orders operating leases total contractual obligations future operating lease commitments for leases have not been reduced by future minimum sublease rentals to be received through december aggregating million 
open purchase orders are primarily for inventory items and research and development supplies 

table of contents in september  we entered into an amendment to our lease for our corporate headquarters in san diego 
the lease amendment provides for the deferral of approximately million of the monthly rent payments by reducing the monthly payments through september  and increasing the aggregate monthly payments by the deferred amount for the remaining term of the lease  from october  to september  the total obligation under the lease remains unchanged 
the contractual obligation table above reflects the deferral of these rent payments 
other commitments and contingencies that may result in contractual obligations to pay are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements through however  based on our current plans  we will require additional investment that we have not yet secured 
the actual amount of funds that we will need will be determined by many factors  some of which are beyond our control  and we may need funds sooner than currently anticipated 
these factors include but are not limited to the size of our future operating losses  the level of our success in selling our massarray products and services  our ability to introduce and sell new products and services  and successfully reduce inventory levels of earlier products  the level of our selling  general and administrative expenses  our success in and the expenses associated with researching and developing diagnostic products  alone or in collaboration with our partners  and obtaining any required regulatory approval for those products  the extent of our research and development pursuits  including our level of investment in massarray product research and development  and non invasive prenatal diagnostic technology research and development  the extent to which we enter into  maintain  and derive revenues from licensing agreements  including agreements to out license our disease gene discoveries  research and other collaborations  joint ventures and other business arrangements  the extent to which we acquire  and our success in integrating  technologies or companies  the level of our legal expenses including those expenses associated with litigation and with intellectual property protection  and regulatory changes and technological developments in our markets 
we had a million bank line of credit provided by the union bank of california  which expired on january  at december   we had outstanding stand by letters of credit with financial institutions totaling million  related to our building and operating leases 
letters of credit amounting to million will not be drawn down unless we default upon our obligations under the respective agreements 
an operating lease letter of credit of million will remain in place until the expiration of our newton  massachusetts building lease agreement in december item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term investments the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was 
table of contents issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and interest rates later rise  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities rated bbb or above by standard poors 
our investment policy includes a minimum quality rating for all new investments 
if an investment we hold falls below this level  we research the reasons for the fall and determine if we should continue to hold the investment in order to minimize our exposure to market risk of the investment 
we have not experienced any significant losses in our investment portfolio as a result of rating changes 
the average duration of all of our investments has generally been less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we have foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the great british pound  or gbp  and the euro  or eur 
the subsidiaries accounts are translated from the relevant functional currency to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  for balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenues and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our subsidiaries conduct their business with customers in local currencies 
exchange gains and losses arising from these transactions are recorded using the actual exchange differences on the date of the transaction 
we have not taken any action to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  such as options or futures contracts  with respect to transactions with our subsidiaries or transactions with our customers where the invoicing currency is not the us dollar 
the table below sets forth our currency exposure ie  those transactional exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognized in the income and expenditure account on our net monetary assets and liabilities 
these exposures consist of our monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency used by us or our subsidiary having the asset or liability 
functional currency of operations as of december  net foreign monetary assets liabilities euro us dollars gbp in millions euro a movement of in the us dollar to gbp exchange rate would create an unrealized gain or loss of approximately  a movement of in the us dollar to euro exchange rate would create an unrealized gain or loss of approximately  we had no off balance sheet  or unrecognized  gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning or end of the year ended december  we had no deferred gains or losses during the years ended december   or inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented
