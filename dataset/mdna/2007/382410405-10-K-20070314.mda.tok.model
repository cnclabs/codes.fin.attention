oil and gas marketing and major customers marketing 
essentially all of our natural gas production is sold under spot or market sensitive contracts to various gas purchasers on short term contracts 
our condensate and crude oil production is sold to various purchasers under short term rollover agreements based on current market prices 
customers 
due to the nature of the industry  we sell our oil and natural gas production to a limited number of purchasers and  accordingly  amounts receivable from such purchasers could be significant 
revenues from these sources as a percent of oil and gas revenues for the periods presented were as follows year ended december  louis dreyfus corporation shell trading tristar producer services chevron texaco 
table of contents competition the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
major and independent oil and gas companies  drilling and production acquisition programs and individual producers and operators are active bidders for desirable oil and gas properties  as well as the equipment and labor required to operate those properties 
many competitors have financial resources substantially greater than ours  and staffs and facilities substantially larger than us 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and gas production will depend in part on the cost and availability of alternative fuels  the level of consumer demand  the extent of domestic production of oil and gas  the extent of importation of foreign oil and gas  the cost of and proximity to pipelines and other transportation facilities  regulations by state and federal authorities and the cost of complying with applicable environmental regulations 
employees at march   we had full time employees in our two administrative offices and two field offices  none of whom is represented by any labor union 
in late march   we expect to close the sale of substantially all of our south louisiana properties to a private company 
following the sale  we expect to have full time employees and one field office 
we regularly use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services  particularly in the areas of construction  design  well site supervision  permitting and environmental assessment 
independent contractors usually perform field and on site production operation services for us  including gauging  maintenance  dispatching  inspection and well testing

regulations the availability of a ready market for any natural gas and oil production depends upon numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors include regulation of natural gas and oil production  federal and state regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control  state limits on allowable rates of production by a well or proration unit  the amount of natural gas and oil available for sale  the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels 
for example  a productive natural gas well may be shut in because of an oversupply of natural gas or the lack of an available natural gas pipeline in the areas in which we may conduct operations 
state and federal regulations generally are intended to prevent waste of natural gas and oil  protect rights to produce natural gas and oil between owners in a common reservoir  control the amount of natural gas and oil produced by assigning allowable rates of production and control contamination of the environment 
pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal  state and local agencies as well 
environmental matters our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences  restrict the type  quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas and require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the issuance of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the assessment of remedial obligations  and the imposition of injunctions to force future compliance 

table of contents the trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment  and thus  any changes in environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition  there is no assurance that this trend will continue in the future 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as amended cercla  also known as the superfund law  and analogous state laws impose strict  joint and several liabilities on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or the sites where the release occurred  and those that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances released at the site 
persons who are responsible for releases under cercla may be subject to joint and several liabilities for remediation costs at the site  and may also be liable for natural resource damages 
additionally  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file tort claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment 
we generate materials in the course of our operations that are regulated as hazardous substances 
we also may incur liability under the resource conservation and recovery act  as amended rcra  which imposes requirements related to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
the us environmental protection agency epa and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and no hazardous wastes 
while there exists an exclusion from the definition of hazardous wastes for certain materials generated in the exploration  development or production of oil and gas  we generate petroleum product wastes and ordinary industrial wastes that may be regulated as solid and hazardous wastes 
the federal water pollution control act clean water act  and analogous state laws  impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants  including spills and leaks of oil and other substances  into waters of the united states 
the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited  except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by epa or an analogous state agency 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations 
in addition  the oil pollution act of opa imposes a variety of requirements related to the prevention of oil spills into navigable waters 
opa subjects owners of facilities to strict  joint and several liabilities for specified oil removal costs and certain other damages arising from a spill 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with the clean water act and opa requirements 
the federal clean air act  and comparable state laws  regulates emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements 
in addition  epa has developed  and continues to develop  stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal clean air act and associated state laws and regulations 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable air permitting and control technology requirements 
state statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
in addition  there are state statutes  rules and regulations governing conservation matters  including the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties  establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells and the spacing  plugging and abandonment of such wells 
such statutes and regulations may limit the rate at which oil and gas could otherwise be produced from our properties and may restrict the number of wells that may be drilled on a particular lease or in a particular field 
management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition 

table of contents item a 
risk factors our financial and operating results are subject to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
these factors include the following our actual production  revenues and expenditures related to our reserves are likely to differ from our estimates of proved reserves 
we may experience production that is less than estimated and drilling costs that are greater than estimated in our reserve report 
these differences may be material 
the proved oil and gas reserve information included in this report are estimates 
these estimates are based on reports prepared by our independent reserve engineers nsa and were calculated using oil and gas prices as of december  these prices will change and may be lower at the time of production than those prices that prevailed at the end of reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  including historical production from the area compared with production from other similar producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies assumptions concerning future oil and gas prices  and assumptions concerning future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective  each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating proved reserves the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered  the production and operating costs incurred  the amount and timing of future development expenditures  and future oil and gas sales prices 
furthermore  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 
our actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely be different from estimates and the differences may be material 
the discounted future net cash flows included in this document should not be considered as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to our properties 
as required by the sec  the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for oil and gas  increases or decreases in consumption  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used to calculate discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  and which we use in calculating our pre tax pv value  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 

table of contents our future revenues are dependent on the ability to successfully complete drilling activity 
drilling and exploration are the main methods we utilize to replace our reserves 
however  drilling and exploration operations may not result in any increases in reserves for various reasons 
exploration activities involve numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered 
in addition  the future cost and timing of drilling  completing and producing wells is often uncertain 
furthermore  drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including lack of acceptable prospective acreage  inadequate capital resources  unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  including hurricanes  unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment or labor  reductions in oil and gas prices  limitations in the market for oil and gas  title problems  compliance with governmental regulations  and mechanical difficulties 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop and exploit prospects or properties depend in part on data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often uncertain 
in addition  we recently completed drilling our first horizontal well in the cotton valley trend  which is the first well we have drilled in the cotton valley trend utilizing this technique 
we have only limited experience drilling horizontal wells and there can be no assurance that this method of drilling will be as effective or effective at all as we currently expect it to be 
in addition  higher oil and gas prices generally increase the demand for drilling rigs  equipment and crews and can lead to shortages of  and increasing costs for  such drilling equipment  services and personnel 
such shortages could restrict our ability to drill the wells and conduct the operations which we currently have planned 
any delay in the drilling of new wells or significant increase in drilling costs could adversely affect our ability to increase our reserves and production and reduce our revenues 
natural gas and oil prices are volatile  and low prices have had in the past and could have in the future a material adverse impact on our business 
our success will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas 
these market prices tend to fluctuate significantly in response to factors beyond our control 
the prices we receive for our crude oil production are based on global market conditions 
the general pace of global economic growth  the continued instability in the middle east and other oil and gas producing regions and actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  and its maintenance of production constraints  as well as other economic  political  and environmental factors will continue to affect world supply and prices 
domestic natural gas prices fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors including us economic conditions  weather patterns  other factors affecting demand such as substitute fuels  the impact of drilling levels on crude oil and natural gas supply  and the environmental and access issues that limit future drilling activities for the industry 

table of contents average oil and natural gas prices fluctuated substantially during the three year period ended december  based on recent history of our industry  fluctuations during the past several years in the demand and supply of crude oil and natural gas have contributed to  and are likely to continue to contribute to  price volatility 
crude oil and natural gas prices are extremely volatile 
any actual or anticipated reduction in crude oil and natural gas prices would depress the level of exploration  drilling and production activity 
we expect that commodity prices will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
the following table includes high and low for  year end and current prices  natural gas price per one million british thermal units or mmbtu and crude oil west texas intermediate or wti henry hub per mmbtu january  high september  low december  march  wti per barrel july  high november  low december  march  changes in commodity prices significantly affect our capital resources  liquidity and expected operating results 
price changes directly affect revenues and can indirectly impact expected production by changing the amount of funds available to us to reinvest in exploration and development activities 
reductions in oil and natural gas prices not only reduce revenues and profits  but could also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable 
significant declines in prices could result in non cash charges to earnings due to impairment 
we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to changing commodity prices and we have hedged a targeted portion of our anticipated production for our use of oil and gas price hedging contracts may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in our net income 
we use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations 
while the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines  their use may also limit future revenues from price increases 
our results of operations may be negatively impacted by our financial derivative instruments and fixed price forward sales contracts in the future and these instruments may limit any benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas 
for the year ended december   we realized a loss on settled financial derivatives of million 
for the years ended december  and  we realized a loss on settled financial derivatives of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we recognized in earnings an unrealized gain on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting in the amount of million 
for financial reporting purposes  this unrealized gain was combined with a million realized loss in resulting in a total unrealized and realized gain on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting in the amount of million for this gain was recognized because the natural gas hedges were deemed ineffective for  and all previously effective oil hedges were deemed ineffective for the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   we recognized in earnings an unrealized loss on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting in the amount of million 
for financial reporting purposes  this unrealized loss was combined with a million realized loss in resulting in a total unrealized and 
table of contents realized loss on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting in the amount of million in for the year ended december   we recognized in earnings an unrealized gain on derivative instruments in the amount of million 
this loss and gain were recognized because the natural gas hedges were deemed to be ineffective for  and for the fourth quarter of  and accordingly  the changes in fair value of such hedges could no longer be reflected in other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
to the extent that the hedges are not deemed to be effective in the future  we will likewise be exposed to volatility in earnings resulting from changes in the fair value of our hedges 
see note hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
delays in development or production curtailment affecting our material properties may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
the size of our operations and our capital expenditure budget limits the number of wells that we can develop in any given year 
complications in the development of any single material well may result in a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a relatively small number of wells contribute a substantial portion of our production 
if we were to experience operational problems resulting in the curtailment of production in any of these wells  our total production levels would be adversely affected  which would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
because our operations require significant capital expenditures  we may not have the funds available to replace reserves  maintain production or maintain interests in our properties 
we must make a substantial amount of capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves 
historically  we have paid for these expenditures with cash from operating activities  proceeds from debt and equity financings and asset sales 
our revenues or cash flows could be reduced because of lower oil and natural gas prices or for other reasons 
if our revenues or cash flows decrease  we may not have the funds available to replace reserves or maintain production at current levels 
if this occurs  our production will decline over time 
other sources of financing may not be available to us if our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure requirements 
where we are not the majority owner or operator of an oil and gas property  such as the lafitte field  we may have no control over the timing or amount of capital expenditures associated with the particular property 
if we cannot fund such capital expenditures  our interests in some properties may be reduced or forfeited 
we may have difficulty financing our planned growth 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial capital expenditure and working capital needs  particularly as a result of our drilling program 
in the future  we expect that we will require additional financing  in addition to cash generated from operations  to fund planned growth 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
in the event additional capital resources are unavailable  we may curtail drilling  development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 
if we are not able to replace reserves  we may not be able to sustain production at present levels 
our future success depends largely upon our ability to find  develop or acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development  exploration or acquisition activities  our proved reserves will decline over time 
in addition  approximately of our total estimated proved reserves by volume at december   were undeveloped 
by their nature  estimates of undeveloped reserves are less certain 
recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
we may not be able to successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future 
in addition  we may not be able to acquire proved reserves at acceptable costs 

table of contents we may incur substantial impairment writedowns 
if management s estimates of the recoverable reserves on a property are revised downward or if oil and natural gas prices decline  we may be required to record additional non cash impairment writedowns in the future  which would result in a negative impact to our financial position 
we review our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a depletable unit basis when circumstances suggest there is a need for such a review 
to determine if a depletable unit is impaired  we compare the carrying value of the depletable unit to the undiscounted future net cash flows by applying management s estimates of future oil and natural gas prices to the estimated future production of oil and gas reserves over the economic life of the property 
future net cash flows are based upon our independent reservoir engineers estimates of proved reserves 
in addition  other factors such as probable and possible reserves are taken into consideration when justified by economic conditions 
for each property determined to be impaired  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the property on a depletable unit basis 
fair value is estimated to be the present value of expected future net cash flows 
any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depreciation  depletion  impairment and amortization to reduce our recorded basis in the asset 
each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of judgment  including the determination of the depletable units estimated reserves  future cash flows and fair value 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded impairments of million and million  respectively 
we did not record an impairment loss for the year ended december  management s assumptions used in calculating oil and gas reserves or regarding the future cash flows or fair value of our properties are subject to change in the future 
any change could cause impairment expense to be recorded  impacting our net income or loss and our basis in the related asset 
any change in reserves directly impacts our estimate of future cash flows from the property  as well as the property s fair value 
additionally  as management s views related to future prices change  the change will affect the estimate of future net cash flows and the fair value estimates 
changes in either of these amounts will directly impact the calculation of impairment 
a majority of our production  revenue and cash flow from operating activities are derived from assets that are concentrated in a geographic area 
approximately of our estimated proved reserves at december   and a similar percentage of our production during were associated with our cotton valley trend 
we have under contract to sell substantially all of our south louisiana properties to a private company  with an anticipated closing date in late march see note acquisitions and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  if the level of production from the remaining properties substantially declines  it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production level and our revenue 
the oil and gas business involves many uncertainties  economic risks and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses 
our oil and gas operations are subject to the economic risks typically associated with exploration  development and production activities  including the necessity of significant expenditures to locate and acquire properties and to drill exploratory wells 
in conducting exploration and development activities  the presence of unanticipated pressure or irregularities in formations  miscalculations or accidents may cause our exploration  development and production activities to be unsuccessful 
this could result in a total loss of our investment in a particular property 
if exploration efforts are unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves and exploration activities cease  the amounts accumulated as unproved costs would be charged against earnings as impairments 
in addition  the cost and timing of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain 
the nature of the oil and gas business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts  cratering  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas or well fluids  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  pollution  releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks 
any of these operating hazards could result in 
table of contents substantial losses to us 
as a result  substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred 
the payment of these amounts could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration  development or acquisitions 
these reductions in funds could result in a loss of our properties 
additionally  some of our oil and gas operations are located in areas that are subject to weather disturbances such as hurricanes 
some of these disturbances can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production 
in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of such risks and losses 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business 
our senior credit facility contains customary restrictions  including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt  grant liens  make investments  consolidate  merge or acquire other businesses  sell assets  pay dividends and other distributions and enter into transactions with affiliates 
we also are required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our credit facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with all the financial covenants of our credit facility 
these restrictions may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or to compete in our industry with companies not similarly restricted 
we may be unable to identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against them 
the acquisition of properties requires us to assess a number of factors  including recoverable reserves  development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain 
in connection with the assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties  but such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems 
in the course of our due diligence  we may not inspect every well  platform or pipeline 
we cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems  such as pipeline corrosion  when an inspection is made 
we may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities that we created 
we may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations 
the incurrence of an unexpected liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we are subject to complex laws and regulations  including environmental regulations that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
development  production and sale of natural gas and oil in the us are subject to extensive laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations 
we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  bonds for ownership  development and production of oil and gas properties  reports concerning operations  and taxation 
in addition  our operations are subject to stringent federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection 
governmental authorities enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them  oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions 
failure to comply with these laws  regulations and permits may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of remedial obligations  and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations 
there is inherent risk of 
table of contents incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in our business 
joint and several strict liabilities may be incurred in connection with discharges or releases of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes on  under or from our properties and from facilities where our wastes have been taken for disposal 
private parties affected by such discharges or releases may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as seek damages for personal injury or property damage 
in addition  changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any such changes that result in more stringent and costly requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
competition in the oil and gas industry is intense  and we are smaller and have a more limited operating history than some of our competitors 
we compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies for property acquisitions 
we also compete for the equipment and labor required to operate and to develop these properties 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
these competitors may be able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and acquire a greater number of properties than we can 
our ability to acquire additional properties and develop new and existing properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct operations  to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
our success depends on our management team and other key personnel  the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations 
our success will depend on our ability to retain and attract experienced engineers  geoscientists and other professional staff 
we depend to a large extent on the efforts  technical expertise and continued employment of these personnel and members of our management team 
if a significant number of them resign or become unable to continue in their present role and if they are not adequately replaced  our business operations could be adversely affected 
some of our operations are exposed to the additional risk of tropical weather disturbances 
some of our production and reserves were located in south louisiana as of december  operations in this area are subject to tropical weather disturbances 
some of these disturbances can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production 
for example  hurricanes katrina and rita in august and september of  respectively  impacted our south louisiana operations 
in january  we announced the sale of substantially all of our properties in south louisiana to a private company 
see note acquisitions and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements 
if the sale closes as expected  our exposure to tropical weather disturbances will be significantly reduced by the end of the first quarter losses could occur for uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or that any particular types of coverage will be available 
an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
hurricane katrina and rita damage costs in excess of our insurance coverage resulted in a million loss for the loss is included in lease operating expenses on our consolidated financial statements 
in  we expect to receive million from our insurance provider for hurricane katrina damage costs 
the receivable is included in accounts receivable trade and other  net on our consolidated financial statements 
we have previously identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting and cannot assure you that we will not again identify a material weakness in the future 
as previously reported in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march   a material weakness was identified in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to recording the fair 
table of contents value of all outstanding derivatives 
the public company accounting oversight board s auditing standard no 
defines a material weakness as a significant deficiency  or combination of significant deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
in order to remediate the material weakness  we implemented changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended june  specifically  we now automatically receive a mark to market valuation from our existing counterparties for all outstanding derivatives 
for any new contracts entered into with a new counterparty  we will concurrently request this automatic distribution 
we also added another layer of review for the fair value calculation prior to review by the chief financial officer 
our management believes that these additional policies and procedures have enhanced our internal control over financial reporting relating to the determination and review of fair value calculations on outstanding derivatives 
our management also believes that  as a result of these measures described above  the material weakness was remediated and that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of june   september   and december  terrorist attacks or similar hostilities may adversely impact our results of operations 
the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities particularly in the middle east may have on the energy industry in general  and on us in particular  is unknown 
uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect our operations in unpredictable ways  including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets  particularly oil  and the possibility that infrastructure facilities  including pipelines  production facilities  processing plants and refineries  could be direct targets of  or indirect casualties of  an act of terror or war 
moreover  we have incurred additional costs since the terrorist attacks of september  to safeguard certain of our assets and we may be required to incur significant additional costs in the future 
the terrorist attacks on september   and the changes in the insurance markets attributable to such attacks have made certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain 
there can be no assurance that insurance will be available to us without significant additional costs 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserve and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can affect these risks 
although from time to time we make use of futures contracts  swaps  costless collars and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  or a prolonged continuation of low prices may substantially adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
overview we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration  exploitation  development and production of oil and natural gas properties primarily in the cotton valley trend of east texas and northwest louisiana 
we operate as one segment as each of our operating areas have similar economic characteristics and each meet the criteria for aggregation as defined in the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we seek to increase shareholder value by growing our oil and gas reserves  production revenues and operating cash flow 
in our opinion  on a long term basis  growth in oil and gas reserves and production  on a cost effective basis  are the most important indicators of performance success for an independent oil and gas company 
management strives to increase our oil and gas reserves  production and cash flow through exploration and exploitation activities 
we develop an annual capital expenditure budget which is reviewed and approved by our 
table of contents board of directors on a quarterly basis and revised throughout the year as circumstances warrant 
we take into consideration our projected operating cash flow and externally available sources of financing  such as bank debt  when establishing our capital expenditure budget 
we place primary emphasis on our internally generated operating cash flow in managing our business 
for this purpose  operating cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities as reflected in our statement of cash flows 
management considers operating cash flow a more important indicator of our financial success than other traditional performance measures such as net income 
our revenues and operating cash flow are dependent on the successful development of our inventory of capital projects  the volume and timing of our production  as well as commodity prices for oil and gas 
such pricing factors are largely beyond our control  however  we employ commodity hedging techniques in an attempt to minimize the volatility of short term commodity price fluctuations on our earnings and operating cash flow 
cotton valley trend expanding acreage position and active development drilling program our relatively low risk development drilling program in the cotton valley trend is primarily centered in and around rusk  panola  angelina  nacogdoches  cherokee  harrison  smith and upshur counties  texas and desoto  caddo and bienville parishes  louisiana 
we continue to build our acreage position in the cotton valley trend and now hold approximately  gross acres as of february  as of year end  we have drilled and or logged a cumulative total of cotton valley wells with a success rate slightly in excess of 
our net production volumes from our cotton valley trend wells aggregated approximately  mcfe per day in  or approximately of our total oil and gas production in the period 
acquisition of remaining interests in dirgin beckville area of cotton valley trend in early december  we acquired a working interest in wells and approximately  gross net acres within the dirgin beckville field in the cotton valley trend from a private company for million 
with the additional interest we now own an approximate working interest in wells and  gross acres in this field 
farmout on  acres in northwest louisiana in november  we announced a definitive farmout agreement covering  gross acres in sections  net acres  in the alabama bend field of bienville parish  louisiana 
the company has farmed in the right to explore for natural gas and oil at no upfront cost 
the company will own a working interest in the initial well drilled in each of the sections and the farmor shall have the right to participate up to for future wells drilled 
to maintain the rights of the entire acreage block  we must commence drilling operations on one well every days from completion date of the previous well 
acquisition of acreage in angelina river play in nacogdoches and angelina counties  texas on february   we announced the acquisition of drilling and development rights in approximately  gross acres  net acres in the angelina river play  on trend with our existing acreage in nacogdoches and angelina counties  texas 
we acquired a working interest in the acreage and will operate the joint venture 
the acquisition was completed in two separate transactions 
in the initial transaction  we acquired a interest for million from a private company 
we also agreed to carry the private company for a interest in the drilling of five wells 
in the second transaction  we are purchasing the remaining interest in the acreage in a like kind exchange for our interest in the mary blevins field in smith county  texas 
south louisiana operations sale of assets on january   the company and malloy energy company  llc malloy energy entered into a purchase and sale agreement with a private company for the sale of substantially all of the company s oil and 
table of contents gas properties in south louisiana 
the total sales price for the company s interest in the oil and gas properties was approximately million  effective july  the total sales price for malloy energy s interests in these properties was approximately million 
see note related party transactions to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding malloy energy 
both the company and malloy energy s total consideration will be reduced by an amount equal to its proportionate share of the greater of million or normal closing adjustments 
we expect the adjusted sales price for the company s interest to be approximately million 
the effective date of the transaction was july  and the closing date of the purchase and sale agreement is targeted for late march  had we completed this transaction at the end of  our proved reserves would have been reduced by approximately  mmcfe 
average daily production for these properties for the fiscal year ending december   was approximately  mcfe or about of the company s total production for this sale will allow us to focus the majority of our efforts on the development of our cotton valley trend acreage  as well as reduce operating costs going forward 
overview of results financial and operating highlights include we increased production over production averaged mmcfe d compared to mmcfe d in our oil and gas revenues totaled million compared to million in  a percent increase 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million from  to million 
estimated proved reserves grew percent to approximately bcfe approximately bcf of natural gas and mmbbls of oil and condensate  with a pre tax present value of future net cash flows  discounted at  of million and an after tax present value of discounted future net cash flows of million 
capital expenditures totaled million in  versus million in as operator  we successfully drilled  completed and placed in production wells during calendar year we issued million in convertible senior notes due  completely paying off our second lien term loan and substantially reducing our bank revolver debt

for these ineffective hedges  we are required to reflect the changes in the fair value of the hedges in earnings rather than in accumulated other comprehensive loss  a component of stockholders equity 
as applied to our hedging program  there must be a high degree of correlation between the actual prices received and the hedge prices in order to justify treatment as cash flow hedges pursuant to sfas we perform historical correlation analyses of the actual and hedged prices over an extended period of time 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that certain of our oil hedges which had previously been effective  fell short of the effectiveness guidelines to be accounted for as cash flow hedges

table of contents summary of critical accounting policies the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list in note description of business and significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
proved oil and natural gas reserves proved reserves are defined by the sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although our external engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates utilized by us 
we cannot predict the types of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 
successful efforts accounting we utilize the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration wells  as well as other exploration expenditures such as seismic costs  are expensed and can have a significant effect on operating results 
successful exploration drilling costs  all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by engineers 
certain costs related to fields or areas that are not fully developed are charged to expense using the units of production method based on total proved oil and natural gas reserves 
impairment of properties we continually monitor our long lived assets recorded in oil and gas properties in the consolidated balance sheets to ensure that they are fairly presented 
we must evaluate our properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
performing these evaluations requires a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable proved and probable oil and natural gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas  unfavorable adjustments to reserves  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
we cannot predict the amount of impairment charges that may be recorded in the future 
asset retirement obligations we are required to make estimates of the future costs of the retirement obligations of our producing oil and gas properties 
this requirement necessitates us to make estimates of our property abandonment costs that  in some cases  will not be incurred until a substantial number of years in the future 
such cost estimates could be subject to significant revisions in subsequent years due to changes in regulatory requirements  technological advances and other factors which may be difficult to predict 
income taxes we are subject to income and other related taxes in areas in which we operate 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required by management due to timing and the impact of future events on when 
table of contents income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by us 
we periodically evaluate our tax operating loss and other carryforwards to determine whether a gross deferred tax asset  as well as a related valuation allowance  should be recognized in our financial statements 
as of december   and in certain prior years  we have reported a net deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet  after deduction of the related valuation allowance  which has been determined on the basis of management s estimation of the likelihood of realization of the gross deferred tax asset as a deduction against future taxable income 
derivative instruments as discussed in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we periodically utilize derivative instruments to manage both our commodity price risk and interest rate risk 
we consider the use of these instruments to be hedging activities 
pursuant to derivative accounting rules  we are required to use mark to market accounting to reflect the fair value of such derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheet 
to the extent that we are able to demonstrate that our use of derivative instruments qualifies as hedging activities  the offsetting entry to the changes in fair value of these instruments is accounted for in other comprehensive income loss 
to the extent that such derivatives are deemed to be ineffective  the offsetting entry to the changes in fair value is reflected in earnings 
at the inception of each hedge  we document that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting expected changes in cash flows from the item hedged 
a hedge must be determined to be highly effective under accounting rules in order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
this assessment  which is updated quarterly  includes an evaluation of the most recent historical correlation between the derivative and the item hedged 
in this analysis  changes in monthly settlement prices on our oil and gas derivatives are compared with the change in physical daily indexed prices that we receive from the field purchasers for our oil and gas production designated for hedging 
should a hedge not be highly effective  it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting treatment and changes in fair value of the hedge are recognized in earnings 
price volatility within a measured month is the primary factor affecting the analysis of effectiveness of our oil and natural gas swaps 
volatility can reduce the correlation between the hedge settlement price and the price received for physical deliveries 
secondary factors contributing to changes in pricing differentials include changes in the basis differential which is the difference in the locally indexed price received for daily physical deliveries of hedged quantities and the index price used in hedge settlement  and changes in grade and quality factors of the hedged oil and natural gas production which would further impact the price received for physical deliveries 
not withstanding the determination that certain commodity swaps in and the fourth quarter of  were not highly effective  management continues to believe that our oil and gas price hedge strategy has been effective in satisfying our financial objective of providing cash flow stability 
our hedge agreements currently consist of a swaps  where we receive a fixed price and pay a floating price  based on nymex quoted prices  and b collars  where we receive the excess  if any  of the floor price over the reference price  based on nymex quoted prices  and pay the excess  if any  of the reference price over the ceiling price 
the terms of our current hedge agreements are described in note hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation plans for all new  modified and unvested share based payment transactions with employees  we measure at fair value and recognize as compensation expense over the requisite period 
the fair value of each option award is estimated using a black scholes option valuation model that requires us to develop estimates for assumptions used in the model

table of contents us based on historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate the expected term of the options

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk despite the measures taken by us to attempt to control price risk  we remain subject to price fluctuations for natural gas and crude oil sold in the spot market 
prices received for natural gas sold on the spot market are volatile due primarily to seasonality of demand and other factors beyond our control 
domestic crude oil and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis 
we enter into futures contracts or other hedging agreements from time to time to manage the commodity price risk for a portion of our production 
we consider these agreements to be hedging activities and  as such  monthly settlements on the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting are reflected in our crude oil and natural gas sales 
our strategy  which is administered by the hedging committee of the board of directors  and reviewed periodically by the entire board of directors  has been to generally hedge between and of our production 
as of december   the commodity hedges we utilized were in the form of a swaps  where we receive a fixed price and pay a floating price  based on nymex quoted prices  and b collars  where we receive the excess  if any  of the floor price over the reference price  based on nymex quoted prices  and pay the excess  if any  of the reference price over the ceiling price
