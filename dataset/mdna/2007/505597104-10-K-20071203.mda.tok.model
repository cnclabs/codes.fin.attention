item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the laclede group  inc 
introduction this management s discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of the laclede group  inc laclede group or the company and its subsidiaries 
it includes management s view of factors that affect its business  explanations of past financial results including changes in earnings and costs from the prior year periods  and their effects on overall financial condition and liquidity 
the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
results of operations laclede group s earnings are primarily derived from the regulated activities of its largest subsidiary  laclede gas company laclede gas or the utility  missouri s largest natural gas distribution company 
laclede gas is regulated by the missouri public service commission mopsc or commission and serves the city of st 
louis and parts of ten other counties in eastern missouri 
laclede gas delivers natural gas to retail customers at rates  and in accordance with tariffs  authorized by the mopsc 
the utility s earnings are primarily generated by the sale of heating energy 
the utility s innovative weather mitigation rate design lessens the impact of weather volatility on laclede gas customers during cold winters and stabilizes the utility s earnings by recovering fixed costs more evenly during the heating season 
due to the seasonal nature of the business of laclede gas  laclede group s earnings are seasonal in nature and are typically concentrated in the november through april period  which generally corresponds with the heating season 
sm p utility resources  inc sm p is a non regulated underground facility locating and marking service business 
the underground locating industry remains competitive with many contracts subject to termination on short term notice 
sm p s customers are concentrated primarily in the utility and telecommunications sectors 
additionally  sm p s results can be influenced by seasonality and trends in the construction sector 
during fiscal year  the company received unsolicited inquiries from various third parties regarding the company s interest in exploring strategic alternatives involving sm p 
while the board has made no decision to engage in any strategic transaction involving sm p  toward the end of fiscal it authorized the company s management to assess the market value of sm p  and the benefits to the company and its shareholders of a potential sale of sm p 
no decision regarding sm p has been made as of the date of filing of this report 
accordingly  a transaction may or may not ultimately result from this process 
laclede energy resources  inc ler is engaged in the non regulated marketing of natural gas and related activities 
ler markets natural gas to both on system utility transportation customers and customers outside of laclede gas traditional service territory  including large retail and wholesale customers 
as such  ler s operations and customer base are subject to fluctuations in market conditions 
other non regulated subsidiaries provide less than of consolidated revenues 
laclede group s strategy continues to include efforts to stabilize and improve performance of its core utility  while developing non regulated businesses and pursuing  in a measured way  additional growth opportunities that complement the utility business 
as for the utility  mitigating the impact of weather fluctuations on laclede gas customers while improving the ability to recover its authorized distribution costs and return continues to be a fundamental component of laclede group s strategy 
the utility s distribution costs are the essential  primarily fixed expenditures it must incur to operate and maintain a more than  mile natural gas distribution system and related storage facilities 
in addition  laclede gas is working to continually improve its ability to provide reliable natural gas service at a reasonable cost  while maintaining and building a secure and dependable infrastructure 
the settlement of the utility s rate case resulted in a stipulation agreement agreement approved by the mopsc on july  as discussed in the regulatory matters section on page  that further enhances the utility s weather mitigation rate design 
the enhancements better ensure the recovery of its fixed costs and margins despite variations in sales volumes due to the impacts of weather and other factors that affect customer usage 
the utility s income from off system sales remains subject to fluctuations in market conditions 
in conjunction with the settlement of the rate case  effective october   the utility retained all pre tax income from off system sales and capacity release revenues up to million annually 
pre tax amounts in excess of million were shared with customers  with the utility retaining of amounts exceeding that threshold 
the agreement approved by the mopsc in the utility s rate case increases the portion of pre tax income from off system sales and capacity release revenues that is shared with customers 
effective october   the utility is allowed to retain to of the first million in annual income earned depending on the level of income earned and of income exceeding million annually 
some of the factors impacting the level of off system sales include the availability and cost of the utility s natural gas supply  the weather in its service area  and the weather in other markets 
when laclede gas service area experiences warmer than normal weather while other markets experience colder weather or supply constraints  some of the utility s natural gas supply is available for off system sales and there may be a demand for such supply in other markets 
wholesale natural gas prices for the heating season rose to unprecedented levels across the nation 
laclede gas continues to work to reduce the impact of higher costs by strategically structuring its natural gas supply portfolio and through the use of financial instruments 
nevertheless  the cost of purchased gas remains high  relative to historical levels 
the utility s purchased gas adjustment pga clause allows laclede gas to flow through to customers  subject to prudence review  the cost of purchased gas supplies  including costs  cost reductions  and related carrying costs associated with the use of financial instruments to hedge the purchase price of natural gas  as well as gas inventory carrying costs 
the utility believes it will continue to be able to obtain sufficient gas supply 
while wholesale natural gas prices declined for the heating season  the generally higher price levels may continue to affect sales volumes due to the conservation efforts of customers and cash flows associated with the timing of collection of gas costs and related accounts receivable from customers 
laclede group continues to develop its non regulated subsidiaries 
sm p is working to further the logical expansion of its business in both new and existing markets 
ler continues to focus on growing its markets on a long term and sustainable basis by providing both on system utility transportation customers and customers outside of laclede gas traditional service area with another choice in non regulated natural gas suppliers 
nevertheless  income from ler s operations is subject to fluctuations in market conditions 
ler reported record earnings during fiscal year as a result of higher margins  caused by gulf coast market volatility  as well as higher wholesale sales volumes 
earnings overview net income by operating segment millions  after tax years ended september regulated gas distribution non regulated services non regulated gas marketing non regulated other net income laclede group s net income was million in fiscal year  compared with million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year net income increased million  or  in fiscal year compared with fiscal year primarily due to improved results reported by both laclede group s regulated gas distribution segment and its non regulated services segment  partially offset by lower earnings recorded by laclede group s non regulated gas marketing segment 
net income increased million  or  in fiscal year compared with fiscal year primarily due to improved results reported by laclede group s non regulated gas marketing segment  partially offset by lower earnings recorded by both laclede group s non regulated services segment and its regulated gas distribution segment 
basic and diluted earnings per share were and  respectively  for fiscal year compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of and  respectively  for fiscal year  and for fiscal year the year to year increases in earnings per share were primarily due to the effect of higher net income in each period 
variations in net income were primarily attributable to the factors described below 
vs 
regulated gas distribution net income increased by million in  compared with the increase in net income was primarily due to the following factors  quantified on a pre tax basis the effect of higher system gas sales volumes  primarily due to colder weather and other variations totaling million  the benefit of the general rate increase  effective august   totaling million  and  higher infrastructure system replacement surcharge isrs revenues totaling million 
these factors were partially offset by increases in operation and maintenance expenses totaling million  and  higher depreciation and amortization expense totaling million resulting from the implementation of new depreciation rates effective january   as authorized by the mopsc  and additional depreciable property 
the non regulated services segment reported earnings in fiscal year totaling million compared with million in fiscal year the improved results were primarily attributable to the effect of a non recurring charge recorded last year in association with the employment related litigation described in note to the consolidated financial statements and the attainment of new business in existing markets this year  which was partially offset by higher operating expenses this year 
the non regulated gas marketing segment reported earnings totaling million for fiscal  a decrease in earnings of million compared with while ler achieved increased sales volumes this year over last  margins this year were reduced as volatility in gulf coast markets stabilized 
ler s sales volumes increased over the same period last year  principally as a result of increased interstate pipeline wholesale transactions 
vs 
regulated gas distribution net income decreased by million in compared with laclede gas implemented several provisions of the settlement of its rate case effective october   resulting in variations in several areas from the previous fiscal year 
the decrease in net income was primarily due to the following factors  quantified on a pre tax basis increases in operation and maintenance expenses  excluding the provision for uncollectible accounts  totaling million  higher depreciation expense totaling million resulting from the implementation of new rates effective february  and january  as authorized by the mopsc  and additional depreciable property  net lower isrs totaling million 
these surcharges were reset to zero effective october   as the isrs related costs were being recovered through base rates effective on that same date 
a new isrs was subsequently implemented june   and  the net effect of lower system gas sales volumes totaling million  primarily due to conservation efforts of our customers 
these factors were partially offset by the benefit of the general rate increase  effective october   totaling million  the recovery of gas inventory carrying costs through the utility s pga clause  effective october   totaling million  and  a lower provision for uncollectible accounts totaling million 
the non regulated services segment reported earnings in fiscal year totaling million compared with million in fiscal year the reduction in earnings resulted primarily from sm p s higher than anticipated expenses related to growth  including those associated with the startup of new business in existing markets  and the net effect of resolution of the previously reported collective action lawsuit and related matters described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the non regulated gas marketing segment reported an increase in earnings of million compared with  primarily as a result of ler s higher margins caused by increased price volatility and hurricane related regional supply demand imbalances  as well as higher sales volumes 
ler s sales volumes increased over the prior year  principally as a result of increased interstate pipeline wholesale transactions 
regulated operating revenues vs 
regulated operating revenues for fiscal year decreased million compared to fiscal year due in part to lower wholesale gas costs 
temperatures experienced in the utility s service area during were colder than the same period last year  but warmer than normal 
total system therms sold and transported were billion for fiscal year compared with billion for fiscal year total off system therms sold and transported were billion for fiscal year compared with billion for fiscal year the decrease in regulated operating revenues was primarily attributable to the following factors millions lower wholesale gas costs passed on to utility customers subject to prudence review by the mopsc higher system sales volumes  primarily due to colder weather  and other variations higher off system sales volumes reflecting more favorable market conditions as described in greater detail in the results of operations lower prices charged for off system sales general rate increase  effective august  higher isrs revenues implemented june   january   and june  total variation vs 
regulated operating revenues for fiscal year increased million  or  above fiscal year due primarily to higher wholesale gas costs 
temperatures experienced in the utility s service area during were warmer than normal but essentially the same as fiscal total system therms sold and transported were billion for fiscal year compared with billion for fiscal year total off system therms sold and transported were billion for fiscal year compared with billion for fiscal year the increase in regulated operating revenues was primarily attributable to the following factors millions higher wholesale gas costs passed on to utility customers subject to prudence review by the mopsc lower system sales volumes and other variations  primarily due to the conservation efforts of customers due to higher natural gas prices lower off system sales volumes higher prices charged for off system sales net effect of the general rate increase  recovery of gas inventory carrying costs  and resetting the isrs to zero  effective october   combined with the subsequent implementation of a new isrs effective june  total variation regulated operating expenses vs 
regulated operating expenses in fiscal year decreased million  or  from fiscal year natural and propane gas expense decreased million from last year s level  primarily attributable to lower rates charged by our suppliers  which was partially offset by higher system volumes purchased for sendout and increased off system gas expense 
other operation and maintenance expenses increased million  or  primarily due to increased maintenance and distribution charges  increased group insurance charges  higher wage rates  and a higher provision for uncollectible accounts 
these factors were partially offset by decreased injuries and damages expense as well as a gain on the disposal of assets 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  primarily due to higher rates authorized in the rate case effective january   and additional depreciable property 
taxes  other than income  decreased million  or  primarily due to lower property taxes and decreased gross receipts taxes attributable to the decreased revenues 
vs 
regulated operating expenses in fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year natural and propane gas expense increased million above last year s level primarily due to higher rates charged by our suppliers  partially offset by lower volumes purchased for sendout and slightly lower off system gas expense 
other operation and maintenance expenses increased million  or  primarily due to implementation costs related to the automated meter reading deployment  higher costs associated with low income energy assistance and energy efficiency programs implemented october   compensation expense associated with laclede group s implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  increased pension costs  and higher wage rates 
these factors were partially offset by a lower provision for uncollectible accounts  lower group insurance charges  and a reduction in costs to remove retired utility plant that were previously charged to expense as incurred 
an accrual for such costs is currently being provided for in depreciation rates 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  primarily due to higher rates effective february  and january   and additional depreciable property 
taxes  other than income  increased million  or  primarily due to higher gross receipts taxes attributable to the increased revenues 
non regulated services operating revenues and operating expenses laclede group s non regulated services operating revenues for fiscal year increased million from those revenues for fiscal year primarily due to sm p s attainment of new business in existing markets 
the increase in non regulated services operating expenses totaling million was primarily attributable to increased wage  benefit  and vehicle expense  partially offset by the effect of settlement costs associated with the employment related litigation recorded in fiscal year laclede group s non regulated services operating revenues for fiscal year increased million from those revenues for fiscal year primarily due to sm p s attainment of new business in existing markets 
the increase in non regulated services operating expenses totaling million was primarily attributable to higher than anticipated operating expenses  including those associated with the startup of new business in existing markets  and the net effect of resolution of the previously reported collective action lawsuit and related matters described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
non regulated gas marketing operating revenues and operating expenses non regulated gas marketing revenues increased million in fiscal year from those revenues for fiscal year primarily due to increased sales volumes by ler  partially offset by lower per unit gas sales prices 
the increase in non regulated gas marketing operating expenses of million was primarily associated with increased gas expense related to increased volumes purchased  partially offset by lower prices 
non regulated gas marketing revenues increased million in fiscal year from those revenues for fiscal year primarily due to higher sales prices and increased sales volumes by ler 
the increase in non regulated gas marketing operating expenses of million was primarily associated with increased gas expense related to higher prices and increased volumes purchased 
non regulated other operating revenues and operating expenses non regulated other operating revenues increased million in fiscal  primarily due to an increase in merchandise sales 
the million decrease in non regulated other operating revenues in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in sales levels recorded by laclede pipeline company 
non regulated other operating expenses increased million in fiscal  primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with increased merchandise sales 
the million decrease in non regulated other operating expenses in fiscal year from fiscal year  was primarily due to a decrease in expenses associated with decreased sales recorded by laclede pipeline company 
other income and income deductions net other income and income deductions net increased million in fiscal year  due to increased investment income  higher interest income  and other minor variations  partially offset by lower income associated with carrying costs applied to under recoveries of gas costs 
such carrying costs are recovered through the utility s pga clause 
the million increase in other income and income deductions net in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily attributable to additional income resulting from laclede gas application of carrying costs to all over or under recoveries of gas costs  including costs and cost reductions associated with the use of financial instruments  as approved by the mopsc effective october  previously  carrying costs were applicable only to certain gas cost components exceeding a predetermined threshold 
such income is recovered through the pga clause 
this additional income was partially offset by the utility s receipt and recognition in april of proceeds related to its interest  as a policyholder  in the sale of a mutual insurance company totaling million 
interest charges the million increase in interest charges in fiscal year was primarily due to higher interest on short term debt and other minor variations 
average short term interest rates were this year compared with in fiscal year average short term borrowings were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the million increase in interest charges in fiscal year was primarily due to higher interest on short term debt 
average short term interest rates were in fiscal compared with in fiscal year average short term borrowings were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
increased interest on short term debt was slightly offset by lower interest on long term debt due to the november maturity of million principal amount of first mortgage bonds and the may maturity of million principal amount of first mortgage bonds 
the decreased interest on long term debt due to the aforementioned maturities was partially offset by the issuance of million principal amount of first mortgage bonds on june  income taxes the increases in income tax expense for all periods reported are primarily due to higher pre tax income 
the year to year variations in income tax expense also reflect the effect of lower income tax expense in fiscal year associated with a change in estimated tax depreciation and other property related deductions 
labor agreement laclede gas has a labor agreement with locals and of the united steel  paper and forestry  rubber  manufacturing  energy  allied industrial and service workers international union  which represent of laclede gas employees 
the agreement expires on july  the missouri natural division of laclede gas has a labor agreement with local of the united steel  paper and forestry  rubber  manufacturing  energy  allied industrial and service workers international union  which represents of laclede gas employees 
the agreement expires on april  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following represent the more significant items requiring the use of judgment and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements allowances for doubtful accounts estimates of the collectibility of trade accounts receivable are based on historical trends  age of receivables  economic conditions  credit risk of specific customers  and other factors 
the utility s provision for uncollectible accounts is dependent on the regulatory treatment provided for such costs 
beginning in fiscal  as approved by the mopsc  the utility is allowed to defer for future recovery certain costs associated with amendments to the cold weather rule 
for details on the cold weather rule  see the regulatory matters section on page employee benefits and postretirement obligations pension and postretirement obligations are calculated by actuarial consultants that utilize several statistical factors and other assumptions related to future events  such as discount rates  returns on plan assets  compensation increases  and mortality rates 
for the utility  the amount of expense recognized and the amounts reflected in other comprehensive income are dependent upon the regulatory treatment provided for such costs  as discussed further below 
certain liabilities related to group medical benefits and workers compensation claims  portions of which are self insured and or contain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit exposure  are established based on historical trends 
the table below reflects the sensitivity of laclede s plans to potential changes in key assumptions pension plan benefits estimated estimated increase increase decrease to decrease to projected annual benefit net pension increase obligation cost actuarial assumptions decrease thousands thousands discount rate rate of future compensation increase expected return on plan assets postretirement benefits estimated estimated increase increase decrease to decrease to projected annual net postretirement postretirement benefit benefit increase obligation cost actuarial assumptions decrease thousands thousands discount rate expected return on plan assets annual medical cost trend excludes the impact of regulatory deferral mechanism 
see note  pension plans and other postretirement benefits  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the regulatory treatment of these costs 
goodwill valuation in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances occur that may reduce the value of goodwill 
in performing impairment tests  valuation techniques require the use of estimates with regard to discounted future cash flows of operations  involving judgments based on a broad range of information and historical results 
if the test indicates impairment has occurred  goodwill would be reduced  adversely impacting earnings 
this test of goodwill impairment may be carried forward from one year to the next if the most recent fair value determination exceeded the carrying value by a substantial margin  the assets and liabilities that comprise the reporting entity had not changed significantly  and the company believes that based on an analysis of events that had occurred and circumstances that had changed since the most recent fair value determination  the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount is remote 
laclede gas accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
this statement sets forth the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for those companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third party regulator 
the provisions of sfas no 
require  among other things  that financial statements of a regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators  where appropriate 
these actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non regulated enterprises 
when this occurs  costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet regulatory assets and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates 
also  regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future regulatory liabilities 
management believes that the current regulatory environment supports the continued use of sfas no 
and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process 
management believes the following represent the more significant items recorded through the application of sfas no 
the utility s pga clause allows laclede gas to flow through to customers  subject to prudence review  the cost of purchased gas supplies  including the costs  cost reductions and related carrying costs associated with the utility s use of natural gas financial instruments to hedge the purchase price of natural gas 
the difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the pga are recorded as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities that are recovered or refunded in a subsequent period 
effective october   the utility was authorized to implement the recovery of gas inventory carrying costs through its pga rates to recover costs it incurs to finance its investment in gas supplies that are purchased during the storage injection season for sale during the heating season 
the mopsc also approved the application of carrying costs to all over or under recoveries of gas costs  including costs and cost reductions associated with the use of financial instruments 
previously  carrying costs were applicable only to certain gas cost components exceeding a predetermined threshold 
effective october   pursuant to the rate case  the pga clause also provides for a portion of income from off system sales and capacity release revenues to be flowed through to customers 
the company records deferred tax liabilities and assets measured by enacted tax rates for the net tax effect of all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes  and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
changes in enacted tax rates  if any  and certain property basis differences will be reflected by entries to regulatory asset or liability accounts for regulated companies  and will be reflected as income or loss for non regulated companies 
pursuant to the direction of the mopsc  laclede gas provision for income tax expense for financial reporting purposes reflects an open ended method of tax depreciation 
laclede gas provision for income tax expense also records the income tax effect associated with the difference between overheads capitalized to construction for financial reporting purposes and those recognized for tax purposes without recording an offsetting deferred income tax expense 
these two methods are consistent with the regulatory treatment prescribed by the mopsc 
asset retirement obligations are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations and financial accounting standards board interpretation number fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
asset retirement obligations are calculated using various assumptions related to the timing  method of settlement  inflation  and profit margins that third parties would demand to settle the future obligations 
these assumptions require the use of judgment and estimates and may change in future periods as circumstances dictate 
as authorized by the mopsc  laclede gas accrues future removal costs associated with its property  plant and equipment through its depreciation rates  even if a legal obligation does not exist as defined by sfas no 
and fin the difference between removal costs recognized in depreciation rates and the accretion expense and depreciation expense recognizable under sfas no 
and fin is a timing difference between the recovery of these costs in rates and their recognition for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  consistent with sfas no 
 these differences are deferred as regulatory liabilities 
the amount of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost recognized in the financial statements related to the utility s qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans is based upon allowances  as approved by the mopsc  which have been established in the rate making process for the recovery of these costs from customers 
the differences between these amounts and actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs incurred for financial reporting purposes are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities 
sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  requires that changes that affect the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans  but that are not yet required to be recognized as components of pension and other postretirement benefit cost  be reflected in other comprehensive income 
for the utility s qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans  amounts that would otherwise be reflected in other comprehensive income are deferred with entries to regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities 
for further discussion of significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included on page regulatory matters at the state level  there have been several significant regulatory developments during the fiscal year affecting laclede gas 
some of these issues were impacted by the settlement of the utility s rate case as discussed later in this section 
a law became effective january   that authorizes the mopsc to implement rules and tariff provisions through which rates can be adjusted between general rate case proceedings to reflect increases and decreases in certain costs and revenues 
for gas utilities like laclede gas  these include rate adjustments to reflect revenue changes resulting from the impact of weather and conservation on customer usage and to reflect changes in the costs to comply with environmental laws  rules  and regulations 
various parties have been meeting in an attempt to negotiate rules to implement these programs 
the mopsc has acted on a rule relating to the establishment of a fuel adjustment clause for electric utilities 
while no rules have been implemented for gas utilities  the mopsc has approved rate designs for three gas utilities including laclede gas that mitigate the effects of weather and conservation on utility margins 
in the utility s rate case  the mopsc approved rate design changes allowing laclede gas to better ensure the recovery of the utility s fixed costs and margins despite variations in sales volumes due to the impacts of weather and other factors that affect customer usage 
on october   the missouri office of public counsel proposed an emergency amendment to the mopsc s cold weather rule rule affecting the disconnection and reconnection practices of utilities during the winter heating season 
on december   the mopsc issued an order approving certain changes to the rule to be effective between january and march  on august   after various appeals to the cole county circuit court  missouri court of appeals  and the missouri supreme court by the parties  including laclede gas  the mopsc approved permanent modifications to the rule  including provisions to allow the utility to obtain accounting authorizations and defer for future recovery the costs previously incurred with the emergency amendment for the fiscal heating season 
in conjunction with the settlement of the rate case  the mopsc provided for the recovery of million in costs associated with the fiscal heating season  during the next five year period 
during fiscal  the utility deferred for future recovery an additional million of costs associated with the fiscal heating season 
on october   the utility filed for determination and subsequent recovery of the deferred amount 
on november   the mopsc directed the mopsc staff and the missouri office of public counsel to submit their positions regarding the utility s filing by february  on december   the mopsc staff proposed a disallowance of approximately million related to laclede gas recovery of its purchased gas costs applicable to fiscal following technical conferences  the staff subsequently reduced its proposed disallowance to approximately million 
laclede gas believed that the mopsc staff s position lacked merit and vigorously opposed the adjustment in proceedings before the mopsc on january  on june   the mopsc issued an order rejecting the mopsc staff s proposed disallowance and declaring that the company was not imprudent with respect to the particular gas purchasing practice questioned by the mopsc staff 
this case is now closed 
on november   the utility made an isrs filing with the commission designed to increase revenues by million annually 
on december   the mopsc approved implementation of the utility s proposed isrs filing effective january  on march   the utility made an isrs filing with the commission designed to increase revenues by an additional million annually 
on june   the mopsc approved implementation of the utility s march isrs filing effective june  these surcharges were reset to zero effective august   as the isrs related costs are being recovered through new base rates effective on that same date see the rate case discussion later in this section 
on november   the utility made an isrs filing with the commission designed to increase revenues by million annually  pending approval by the commission 
laclede gas began implementation of an automated meter reading amr system in july through the date of this report  the amr system has been deployed to more than  customer meters  representing well over of laclede s total customer base population 
certain regulatory issues have arisen in conjunction with this implementation 
the utility has approximately of customers with meters inside their premises 
on february   the mopsc staff filed a complaint against the utility alleging that it failed to adequately obtain or use actual meter readings from certain customers and failed to adequately respond to unauthorized gas use 
in addition to seeking authority to pursue penalties  the staff sought customer service accommodations for customers whose previous estimated bills will require adjustment to reflect actual usage 
on may   the missouri office of public counsel also filed a complaint alleging that laclede gas billed customers for prior underestimated usage for a longer period of time than permitted by commission rules 
laclede gas filed responses generally denying the mopsc staff s and missouri office of public counsel s allegations 
on november   laclede gas  the missouri office of public counsel  and other parties filed a stipulation agreement that resolves certain issues raised in this case 
the mopsc staff neither supported nor opposed the stipulation agreement 
on december   the commission approved the stipulation agreement  dismissed the missouri office of public counsel s complaint  and suspended staff s complaint  subject to laclede s compliance with the stipulation agreement 
the primary terms of the stipulation agreement include the utility s provision of bill credits totaling million to customers who received billing adjustments reconciling undercharges for periods exceeding months  a limit on future billing adjustments that reconcile undercharges to months  and additional notices to customers concerning such billing adjustments 
the utility s labor union representing field service workers  usw local union  also raised a number of regulatory matters with the mopsc alleging safety issues associated with the installation of amr and changes in other work practices implemented by laclede gas 
on november   the mopsc denied and dismissed one of these complaints 
on december   the mopsc held a hearing on the union s last remaining complaint 
that hearing was completed on february  on june   the mopsc issued an order denying the union s remaining complaint and dismissing the case 
this case is now closed 
on december   laclede gas filed tariff sheets designed to increase revenues by million annually  or 
although the utility s filing requested an increase of million in non gas revenues  million of that amount was already being paid by customers through the current isrs  which would no longer have been collected upon approval of the utility s rate request 
in addition  laclede gas proposed to increase its pga rates by million in order to recover the gas cost portion of its bad debts through the pga rather than through its non gas distribution rates 
the december filing also proposed a comprehensive regulatory compact that included a pilot program in which residential customers could lock in for a twelve month period the cost per therm of gas included in their monthly bills  a conservation program that would provide customers an opportunity to earn a rebate by conserving natural gas during the peak winter heating months  a three year base rate moratorium  and  an earnings sharing mechanism in which the utility would share with its customers up to percent of earnings in excess of its authorized return  depending on the level of earnings achieved  to the extent that the utility would achieve any such additional earnings as a result of its efforts to make utility service more efficient and sell gas in markets outside of its traditional service territory 
finally  laclede gas proposed several modifications to its weather mitigation rate design in order to better ensure the utility s recovery of its fixed costs 
initially  the mopsc suspended implementation of the utility s proposed rates until november  however  on july   as a result of a june settlement conference  the parties to the case filed a unanimous stipulation agreement agreement with the mopsc resolving all matters in the proceeding 
the mopsc approved the agreement on july  the agreement includes  among other things an increase of million in non gas revenues effective august   including million already being billed to customers through an isrs which would no longer be collected  although the utility retains the right to file for authorization to reinstate an isrs based on future eligible infrastructure related costs  enhancements to the utility s weather mitigation rate design to further stabilize the impact of weather fluctuations on its customers and its ability to better ensure recovery of its fixed costs and margins  despite variations in sales volumes due to the impacts of weather and other factors that affect customer usage  a provision  effective october   for the utility to retain a share in the pre tax income from off system sales and capacity release revenues ranging from to of the first million in annual income earned depending on the level of income earned and of income over million each year  along with reduced pga rates beginning in november to facilitate the timely flow through of the customer share of such income  modifications to provisions that afford the utility an opportunity to retain a portion of any savings it may achieve in connection with the procurement of gas supplies  and  low income and energy efficiency conservation programs for customers  in which the utility will fund million annually  and invest up to an additional million over the next three year period to be collected in future rates 
the base rate moratorium  the earnings sharing mechanism  and certain other items included in the comprehensive regulatory compact  as proposed by laclede gas  were not included in the agreement  however  some of the utility s proposals regarding customer programs will be discussed and developed in the future through a collaborative effort with the parties to the proceeding 
on december   the mopsc staff proposed a disallowance of million related to laclede gas recovery of its purchased gas costs applicable to fiscal  largely on the same grounds as it had proposed regarding the disallowance of the utility s recovery of purchased gas cost applicable to fiscal on september   the staff withdrew its pursuit of million of the disallowance it had originally proposed 
laclede gas believes that the remainder of the mopsc staff s proposed disallowance lacks merit and intends to vigorously oppose the adjustment in proceedings before the mopsc 
at the federal level  laclede pipeline company pipeline  a wholly owned subsidiary of laclede group  filed a tariff with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc on march   requesting approval to transport liquefied petroleum gas under the interstate commerce act 
historically  pipeline has supplied propane to laclede gas to supplement the utility s natural gas supplies during peak consumption periods 
prior to april   in various utility rate proceedings over the years  the mopsc approved laclede gas rates that were intended to include the recovery of pipeline s costs 
pipeline made the march tariff filing due to changes in the types of transactions pipeline conducts with third parties during those periods when laclede gas is not fully utilizing pipeline s capacity 
the mopsc filed a protest to pipeline s filing  to which pipeline responded  and on march   the ferc accepted pipeline s tariff  effective april  on may   the mopsc filed a request for rehearing of the ferc s order approving pipeline s tariff  and on may   the ferc issued a tolling order in connection with the mopsc s request for rehearing which extended the day statutory time period for the ferc to rule on the mopsc s request 
on june   the ferc denied the mopsc s request for rehearing of the ferc s march  order approving pipeline s ferc tariff 
on august   the mopsc filed with the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit a petition for review of the ferc s march  and june  orders 
on august   pipeline filed a motion to intervene in the court proceeding 
on september   the ferc filed a motion to dismiss  maintaining that section of the interstate commerce act precludes judicial review of the ferc s orders 
on october   the mopsc filed a response opposing the ferc s motion 
on november   the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit dismissed the mopsc s petition for review of the ferc s orders accepting pipeline s tariffs 
pipeline is providing liquid propane transportation service to laclede gas pursuant to an approved ferc tariff and a contractual arrangement between pipeline and laclede gas 
in accordance with the terms of that agreement  laclede gas is obligated to pay pipeline approximately million annually  at current rates  commencing april  the agreement renews at the end of each contract year  unless terminated by either party upon provision of at least six months notice

inflation the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the historical costs of events and transactions  regardless of the purchasing power of the dollar at the time 
due to the capital intensive nature of the business of laclede gas  the most significant impact of inflation is on the depreciation of utility plant 
rate regulation  to which laclede gas is subject  allows recovery through its rates of only the historical cost of utility plant as depreciation 
while no plans exist to undertake replacements of plant in service other than normal replacements and those under existing replacement programs  laclede gas believes that any higher costs experienced upon replacement of existing facilities would be recovered through the normal regulatory process

cash flows the company s short term borrowing requirements typically peak during colder months when laclede gas borrows money to cover the lag between when it purchases natural gas and when its customers pay for that gas 
changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas  variations in the timing of collections of gas cost under the utility s pga clause  the seasonality of accounts receivable balances  and the utilization of storage gas inventories cause short term cash requirements to vary during the year  and can cause significant variations in the utility s cash provided by or used in operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended was million  compared with net cash used in operating activities of million for fiscal year and net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal year the year to year variations are primarily attributable to the timing of the utility s cash receipts and payments related to accounts payable  accounts receivable  deferred purchased gas cost  and the cost of natural gas storage inventories  all of which were impacted by year to year changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas 
these variations were partially offset by improved cash flows at ler during fiscal net cash used in investing activities for fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities primarily reflected capital expenditures in all periods  and an acquisition by sm p in fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal year net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal year and net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal the year to year variations are primarily due to the level of short term debt required as a result of fluctuations in cash provided by operating activities associated with the effect of changes in natural gas prices described previously 
effective october   the utility applies carrying costs to all over and under recoveries of gas costs  including costs and cost reductions associated with the use of financial instruments and gas storage inventories 
liquidity and capital resources as indicated above  the company s short term borrowing requirements typically peak during the colder months 
these short term cash requirements have traditionally been met through the sale of commercial paper supported by lines of credit with banks 
throughout this fiscal year  laclede gas had a line of credit in place of million  which expires in december in november  the utility established a seasonal line of credit of million  which will expire in march the utility had short term borrowings aggregating to a maximum of million at any one time during the fiscal year 
due to disruptions in the commercial paper market  laclede gas drew on its bank line during the fourth quarter to replace higher cost commercial paper  up to a maximum of million 
all such borrowings were repaid prior to september   as the commercial paper market returned to more normal conditions 
short term commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september  were million at a weighted average interest rate of per annum 
based on short term borrowings at september   a change in interest rates of basis points would increase or decrease pre tax earnings and cash flows by approximately million on an annual basis 
portions of such increases or decreases may be offset through the application of pga carrying costs 
laclede gas lines of credit include covenants limiting total debt  including short term debt  to no more than of total capitalization and requiring earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to be at least times interest expense 
on september   total debt was of total capitalization 
for the fiscal year ended september   ebitda was times interest expense

at september   laclede gas had fixed rate long term debt  including current obligations  totaling million 
on november   laclede gas paid at maturity million principal amount of first mortgage bonds 
this maturity was funded through short term borrowings 
while the remaining long term debt issues are fixed rate  they are subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change 
however  increases or decreases in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if laclede gas were to reacquire any of these issues in the open market prior to maturity 
laclede group has on file a shelf registration on form s with the sec  which allows for the issuance of equity securities  other than preferred stock  and debt securities 
of the million of securities originally registered under this form s  million remain registered and unissued as of september  the amount  timing and type of additional financing to be issued under this shelf registration will depend on cash requirements and market conditions 
short term cash requirements outside of laclede gas have generally been met with internally generated funds 
however  laclede group has million in working capital lines of credit  expiring in august  to meet short term liquidity needs of its subsidiaries 
these lines of credit have a covenant limiting the total debt of the consolidated laclede group to no more that of the company s total capitalization  giving a debt weighting to the subordinated debt issued to an unconsolidated affiliated trust

laclede group has parental guarantees of certain of those vehicle leases and anticipates that the maximum guarantees  including renewals and new leases  will not exceed million 
in the event that laclede group would be required to make payments under these guarantees  it is expected that a significant portion of such payments would be recovered through proceeds from the liquidation of assets obtained under the terms of the leases 
the fair market value of the vehicles being leased is estimated at million 
no amounts have been recorded for these guarantees in the financial statements 
laclede group had guarantees totaling million for performance and payment of certain wholesale gas supply purchases by ler  as of september  since that date  total guarantees issued by laclede group on behalf of ler increased by million bringing the total to million in guarantees outstanding at november  no amounts have been recorded for these guarantees in the financial statements

laclede gas recovers the costs related to its purchases  transportation  and storage of natural gas through the operating of its purchased gas adjustment clause  subject to prudence review  however  variations in the timing of collections of gas costs from customers affect short term cash requirements

market risk laclede gas adopted a risk management policy that provides for the purchase of natural gas financial instruments with the goal of managing price risk associated with purchasing natural gas on behalf of its customers 
this policy prohibits speculation 
costs and cost reductions  including carrying costs  associated with the utility s use of natural gas financial instruments are allowed to be passed on to the utility s customers through the operation of its purchased gas adjustment clause  through which the mopsc allows the utility to recover gas supply costs 
accordingly  laclede gas does not expect any adverse earnings impact as a result of the use of these financial instruments 
at september   the utility held million mmbtu of futures contracts at an average price of per mmbtu 
additionally  million mmbtu of other price risk mitigation was in place through the use of option based strategies 
these positions have various expiration dates  the longest of which extends through october in the course of its business  laclede group s non regulated gas marketing affiliate  ler  enters into fixed price commitments associated with the purchase or sale of natural gas 
as part of ler s risk management policy  ler manages the price risk associated with these commitments by either closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed prices or through the use of exchange traded futures contracts to lock in margins 
at september   ler s unmatched positions were not material to laclede group s financial position or results of operations
