item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section entitled selected financial data in this report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes to this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully discussed in section a of this report  entitled risk factors 
overview we are a leader in the research  development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode  or oled  technologies for use in flat panel display  solid state lighting and other applications 
since  we have been 
table of contents exclusively engaged  and expect to continue to be exclusively engaged  in funding and performing research and development activities relating to oled technologies and materials  and in attempting to commercialize these technologies and materials 
our revenues are generated through contract research  sales of development and commercial chemicals  technology development and evaluation agreements and license fees and royalties 
in the future  we anticipate that the revenues from licensing our intellectual property will become a more significant part of our revenue stream 
while we have made significant progress over the past few years developing and commercializing our family of oled technologies pholed  toled  foled  etc 
and materials  we have incurred significant losses and will likely continue to do so until our oled technologies and materials become more widely adopted by product manufacturers 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties  as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation  the timing and volume of sales of our oled materials for both commercial usage and evaluation purposes  the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development activities  and the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred license fees  valuation of acquired technology and stock based compensation  as described below  are our critical accounting policies as contemplated by the sec 
these policies  which have been reviewed with our audit committee  are discussed in greater detail below 
revenue recognition and deferred license fees contract research revenue represents reimbursements by the us government for all or a portion of the research and development expenses we incur related to our government contracts 
revenue is recognized proportionally as research and development expenses are incurred or as defined milestones are achieved 
in order to ascertain the revenue associated with these contracts for a period  we estimate the proportion of related research and development expenses incurred and whether defined milestones have been achieved 
different estimates would result in different revenues for the period 
we also receive non refundable advance license and royalty payments under certain of our development and technology evaluation agreements 
these payments are classified as deferred revenue and deferred license fees  which represents the cash received and recorded as a liability until such time revenue can be recognized 
payments that are not creditable to a license are recognized as revenue over the life of the agreement 
payments that are creditable to a license are deferred until a license agreement is executed or negotiations have ceased and there is no appreciable likelihood of executing a license agreement with the other party 
if a license agreement is executed  these payments would be recorded as revenues over the expected life of the licensed technology  otherwise  they will be recorded as revenues at the time negotiations with the other party show that there is no appreciable likelihood of entering into a license agreement 
if we used different estimates for the expected life of this licensed technology  reported revenue during the relevant period would differ 
as of december    was recorded as deferred revenue and deferred license fees 

table of contents a portion of our license and royalty revenue for was received from aixtron ag based on ovpd equipment sold by aixtron under our development and license agreement with them 
this revenue was recognized upon our receipt of notification that the equipment was sold and an acknowledgement from aixtron that royalties were due 
valuation of acquired technology we regularly review our acquired oled technologies for events or changes in circumstances that might indicate the carrying value of these technologies may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could cause impairment include  among others  significant changes in our anticipated future use of these technologies and our overall business strategy as it pertains to these technologies  particularly in light of patents owned by others in the same field of use 
as of december   we believe that no revision of the remaining useful lives or write down of our acquired technology was required for  nor was such a revision needed in or if such a write down is required in the future  it could be for up to  the net book value of our acquired technology as of december  valuation of stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which addresses all forms of share based payment awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
it requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
the statement eliminates the intrinsic value based method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  that we used prior to we account for our stock option and warrant grants to non employees in exchange for goods or services in accordance with sfas no 
r and emerging issues task force no 
eitf 
sfas no 
r and eitf require that we record an expense for our option and warrant grants to non employees based on the fair value of the options and warrants granted 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options we have granted for purposes of making the disclosure required by sfas no 
r 
in order to calculate the fair value of the options  assumptions are made for certain components of the model  including risk free interest rate  volatility  expected dividend yield rate and expected option life 
although we use available resources and information when setting these assumptions  changes to the assumptions could cause significant adjustments to the valuation 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of  or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of  or per diluted share for the year ended december  the decrease in net loss was primarily due to increased revenues of  and an increase in interest income of  the decrease in net loss was offset to some extent by an increase of  in operating expenses 
our revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was mainly due to an increase in commercial chemical revenue of  an increase in royalty and license revenue of  and an increase in technology development revenue of  
table of contents the increase was offset by the following a decrease in contract research revenue of  and a decrease in development chemical revenue of  we earned  in contract research revenue from the us government in  compared to  in the decrease was mainly attributable to the timing of revenue recognition under our government contracts 
the number of government contracts we worked under and the level of effort performed under these contracts remained essentially constant from to we earned  from our sales of oled materials for evaluation purposes in  compared to  for corresponding sales in the decrease was mainly due to a customer that formerly purchased evaluation materials commencing the purchase of commercial materials instead 
we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of such purchases from customers due to the early stage of the oled industry 
for  our commercial chemical revenues and our royalty and license revenues were  and  respectively  compared to  and  respectively  for the corresponding period in the increase was due to purchases of our proprietary pholed materials for use in commercial oled products by two new customers 
in the fourth quarter of  we began supplying one of our proprietary pholed materials to samsung sdi for use in a commercial active matrix oled display product 
we cannot accurately predict how long these material sales will continue  as samsung sdi is purchasing material from us on a purchase order basis 
continued sales of our pholed materials to samsung sdi will depend on several factors  including  pricing  availability  continued technical improvement and competitive product offerings 
for the first seven months of  we also supplied one of our proprietary pholed materials to au optronics corporation for use in a commercial active matrix oled display product 
under this arrangement  we recognized both commercial chemical revenues and royalty and license revenue of  on account of our sales of these materials to au optronics 
however  those sales ended when au optronics discontinued its manufacture of this display product  and we do not expect material sales to au optronics to resume in the foreseeable future 
commercial chemical revenues and royalty and license revenue from our sales of these materials to au optronics represented a substantial component of our revenues for our royalty and license revenue for also included fees received under a patent license agreement executed with samsung sdi in april  and a cross license agreement executed with dupont displays  inc in december in connection with each of these agreements  we received upfront payments of license fees and of royalties  both of which have been classified as deferred revenue and deferred license fees 
the deferred license fees are being recognized as license fee revenue over the life of the agreement for samsung sdi  and over years for dupont displays 
the deferred royalties in connection with the samsung sdi agreement will be recognized as samsung sdi commences sales of commercial oled products and reports to us the royalties due on account of those sales 
we expect to start receiving royalties based on samsung sdi s sales of active matrix oled display products in we recognized  in technology development revenue in in connection with technology development and evaluation agreements  compared to  for the same period in although the number of contracts did not change  revenues increased due mainly to the timing of revenue recognition under a contract that commenced in the third quarter of the amount and timing of our receipt of fees for technology development and evaluation services is difficult to predict due to the early stage of the oled industry 
we incurred research and development expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was mainly due to an increase of  in personnel costs  and an increase of  attributable to increased operating costs associated with recent expansion of our new jersey facility 

table of contents the increase was offset to some extent by the following a refund by princeton university for unspent research and development funds of  a decrease of  in amounts payable to ppg industries due to the hiring of certain ppg employees as employees of ours  and a decrease of  in expenses related to the timing of recognition of the expense for stock issuances to non employee members of our scientific advisory board 
included within research and development expenses are patent defense costs of  and  for each of and  respectively 
these costs are associated with the semiconductor energy laboratory sel patent interference matter described in response to item of this report legal proceedings 
we anticipate that our patent defense costs may increase as active matrix oled products using our pholed and other oled technologies and materials enter the consumer marketplace 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in the increase was due mainly to an increase of  in costs relating to personnel due to salary increases and the recognition of stock based compensation under sfas no 
r  and an increase of  attributable to increased operating costs associated with our expanded facility 
royalty and license expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in the increase was due to an increase accrual in royalties due to princeton university of  interest income increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this was the result of higher rates of return on investments during during  we sold approximately million of our state related income tax net operating losses nols to new jersey under the technology tax certificate transfer program 
in  we received proceeds of  from the sale of these nols and recorded these proceeds as an income tax benefit 
during  we sold approximately million of our state related income tax nols and received proceeds from these sales of  we expect to sell a similar quantity of nols in year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of  or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of  or per diluted share for the year ended december  the decrease in net loss was primarily due to increased revenues of  and an increase in interest income of  the decrease in net loss was offset to some extent by an increase of  in operating expenses 
our revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was mainly due to an increase in contract research revenue of  an increase in development chemical revenue of  and an increase in technology development revenue of  the increase was offset by the following a decrease in commercial chemical revenue of  and a decrease in royalty and license revenue of  
table of contents we earned  in contract research revenue from the us government in  compared to  in the increase resulted mainly from our entering into several new government contracts during these contracts also involved additional prototyping work as compared to the more basic research we conducted under our government contracts in we earned  from our sales of oled materials for evaluation purposes in  compared to  for corresponding sales in the increase was mainly due to an increased volume of oled materials purchased for evaluation by potential oled display manufacturers  including our technology development and evaluation partners 
for  our commercial chemical revenues and our royalty and license revenues were  and  respectively  compared to  and  respectively  for the corresponding period in the decrease was due mainly to the timing of purchases of our proprietary pholed materials for use in a commercial oled product by tohoku pioneer corporation 
all commercial chemical revenues in and were from this customer 
our royalty and license revenue for included fees received under our patent license agreement with samsung sdi and our cross license agreement with dupont displays 
royalty and license revenue for also included  of royalty revenue from the sale of ovpd equipment by aixtron ag  one of our licensees 
aixtron sold no such equipment in we recognized  in technology development revenue in in connection with technology development and evaluation agreements  compared to  for the same period in the increase was primarily due to new technology development and evaluation agreements entered into in we incurred research and development expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was mainly attributable to an increase of  in our operating costs  associated in large part with the expansion of our new jersey facility  an increase of  in charges in connection with our development and license agreement with ppg industries see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  an increase of  in expenses related to the timing of recognition of the expense for stock and option issuances to non employee members of our scientific advisory board  and increased patent legal costs of  included within research and development expenses are patent defense costs of  and  for each of and  respectively 
these costs are associated with the sel patent interference matter described in response to item of this report legal proceedings 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in the increase was due mainly to an increase of  in personnel costs due to salary increases and increased healthcare costs  and an increase of  in expenses related to the timing of stock issuances to non employee members of our board of directors 
royalty expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in the increase was mainly due to the minimum royalty requirement under our agreement with motorola notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
under this agreement  we are required to make a minimum royalty payment at the end of the two year period ended december  of  as compared to a payment of  for the two year period ended december  interest income increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the prior year 
this was mainly the result of increased cash balances throughout  due to our march registered offering of common stock  together with higher rates of return on investments during 
table of contents during  we sold approximately million of our state related income tax nols to new jersey under the technology tax certificate transfer program 
in  we received proceeds of  from the sale of these nols and recorded these proceeds as an income tax benefit 
during  we sold approximately million of our state related income tax nols and received proceeds from these sales of we recorded no deemed dividends for the year ended december   compared to  in deemed dividends recorded for the prior year 
in  we issued a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock and completed a registered offering of our common stock 
these actions were deemed dilutive under the terms of a stock purchase warrant we had previously issued and resulted in the reduction of the exercise price of that warrant and an increase in the number of shares issuable under the warrant 
we treated this occurrence as a deemed dividend of  in  there were no actions deemed dilutive under the terms of this warrant 
in  the conversion price of the series b convertible preferred stock we issued to motorola  inc in september was adjusted in accordance with the certificate of designations for that stock 
we accounted for this adjustment as a contingent beneficial conversion feature cbcf 
as a result  we recorded the cbcf as a deemed dividend in the amount of  there were no such deemed dividends in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  short term investments of  and investments in certificates of deposit and other liquid instruments with an original maturity of more than one year of  for a total of  this compares to cash and cash equivalents of  short term investments of  and investments in certificates of deposit and other liquid instruments with an original maturity of more than one year of  for a total of  as of december  the small decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments of  was primarily due to cash used in operating activities and purchases of equipment  offset to some extent by proceeds received from stock purchase warrant and stock option exercises 
cash used in operating activities was  for  as compared to  for the increase was primarily due to changes in the following increased recognition of deferred revenue and deferred license fees received in previous years  and the timing of billings to our customers and payments to our vendors during as compared to cash used in investing activities was  for  as compared to cash provided by investing activities of  for the increase in cash used was due mainly to the partial use of proceeds from the sale of our investments for operating activities 
cash provided by financing activities was  for  as compared to  for the cash provided by financing activities for both and consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock purchase warrants and stock options 
working capital decreased to  as of december   from working capital of  as of december  the reduction was primarily due to an increase in current liabilities relating to the classification of deferred license fees as current liabilities 
in  we received  in non refundable payments under our development and technology evaluation agreements that are creditable against license fees under a license agreement  if executed 
therefore  we classify these advanced payments as current deferred license fees until a license agreement is executed or until there is no appreciable likelihood of entering into a license agreement 
we anticipate  based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations including  among others  assumptions regarding our working capital requirements  the progress of our research and development efforts  the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work  and the timing and costs associated with the preparation  filing  prosecution  maintenance and defense of our patents and patent applications  that we have sufficient cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to meet our obligations through at least 
table of contents we believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long term and short term borrowings  public and private sales of our equity and debt securities and the receipt of cash upon the exercise of warrants and options 
we have an effective shelf registration statement that would enable us to offer  from time to time  up to  of our common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and other securities  subject to market conditions and other factors 
it should be noted  however  that additional funding may be required in the future for research  development and commercialization of our oled technologies and materials  to obtain and maintain patents respecting these technologies and materials  and for working capital and other purposes  the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain 
there can be no assurance that this additional funding will be available to us when needed  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual commitments payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap other obligations sponsored research obligation minimum royalty obligation  year total  year under our amended license agreement with princeton university  the university of southern california and the university of michigan  we are obligated to pay minimum royalties of  per year until such time as the agreement is no longer in effect 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of obligations upon termination of employment of executive officers as a result of a change in control of the company 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities or similar arrangements serving as credit  liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets  or obligations including contingent obligations arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or that engage in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
recently issued accounting pronouncements recently issued accounting pronouncements are addressed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect that the adoption of these recently accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on our financial statements or results of operations
