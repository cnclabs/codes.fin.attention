our products are sold in bulk quantities to manufacturers  formulators and distributors in the health foods  nutritional supplements and animal nutrition markets and as packaged consumer products to distributors  retailers  and direct consumer sales 
the company manufactures its products in hawaii but markets them worldwide  generating  and of its revenues outside of the united states for each of the years ended march   and  respectively 
competing in a global marketplace  the company is influenced by the general economic conditions of the countries in which its customers operate  including adherence to its customers local governmental regulations and requirements 
the company currently has no material foreign exchange exposure 
the company reported a net loss of  or per diluted share for fiscal compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share for fiscal cash and cash equivalents at march  were  down  from a year ago 
working capital declined to  at march  from working capital of  a year ago  primarily due to decreased cash and equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable and inventory balances 
the following table details selected financial data highlighting three key areas year ended march  in thousands net sales spirulina products natural astaxanthin products other products gross profit as a percentage of sales operating expenses as a percentage of sales net sales for fiscal were  or lower than the  reported for the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal  the company experienced a reduction of naturose sales to the worldwide aquaculture market compared to fiscal due to decreased production of astaxanthin during part of the second quarter  the third quarter  and continuing into the fourth quarter of fiscal the limited production of astaxanthin during this time was used for the production of higher value and higher margin bioastin products rather than naturose 
while the company has taken action to diversify its market for naturose in selected markets in europe and new aquaculture markets in japan  it is focusing less effort on naturose 
the company s emphasis is on first growing the market for its bioastin products followed by market growth for naturose 
the company will continue to contain discretionary operating spending but may invest in focused expenditures particularly in advertising and clinical trials in the human nutrition and cosmetics markets 
externally  the company is also working with industry leading manufacturers in these markets to integrate bioastin into their products 
the company intends to emphasize market acceptance of its natural astaxanthin products as increased competition from other producers of natural and synthetic astaxanthin may result in the decline of margins generated by its natural astaxanthin products 
management cannot predict whether the outcomes of any of these strategies will be successful 
as depicted in the preceding table  the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the fiscal year ended march   down from for fiscal and for fiscal management expects the company s gross profit margin percentage for the first quarter of fiscal to be improved over those reported for the last part of fiscal there are many factors which have materially diminished gross profit 
these particularly include sales volume and mix and below normal capacity due to both customary and complex production variables related to astaxanthin production 
factors also include an increase in sales volume discounts  competitive pricing results  and increases in the cost of raw materials  raw material freight costs  and significant changes in demand for the company s products 
astaxanthin production during fiscal was particularly impacted by an imbalance in the complex biological processes and mechanisms involved in its growth and production 
after months of effort  we believe we have resolved the imbalance in previously discussed astaxanthin production problems 
astaxanthin production appears to be returning to historical levels 
this should result in concurrent improvement in per unit production costs 
however  because complex biological processes are involved  we cannot assure the results of such corrective efforts 
because the company s processes are agricultural  it is important to maintain increased astaxanthin production volumes in order to support the minimal resource levels required to sustain a large scale agricultural facility the company expects its financial results of the first quarter of fiscal compared to the last quarter of fiscal to reflect an improved gross margin percentage and a reduction in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales  however  the specific level of improvement is not yet determinable 
the decrease in gross profit margin percentage between fiscal and was primarily due to a change in sales mix 
the company will continue to contain discretionary spending  and will take advantage of opportunities to minimize the use of raw materials  including chemicals and utilities 
the company recorded a non cash impairment write down of production equipment and leasehold improvements of million in fiscal year as a result of an analysis required under sfas no 
if we achieve our future planned results  we do not currently expect to record additional non cash impairment charges in to offset increased production costs  the company continues to strive to increase production efficiencies in volume yield  potency  and quality consistent with the company s commitment to produce high value  high quality products 
however  these efforts cannot be guaranteed to achieve the desired results 
results of operations revenues net sales for fiscal totaled  a decrease from net sales of  in fiscal and a decrease of from net sales of  reported in fiscal the following is a discussion of revenues by major product category 
spirulina the company has been producing spirulina pacifica  a strain of spirulina microalga  since revenues generated from the company s spirulina products are a significant portion of total revenues  amounting to   and  for the years ended march   and respectively 
although the company believes that spirulina is a mature product in a highly competitive market  the dollar amount of revenues has remained relatively constant as a percentage of total revenues for the three years ended march   at  and  respectively 
approximately  or of net sales for the year ended march  were to spirulina international b 
v  a spirulina marketing and distribution company based in the netherlands 
sales to this customer during fiscal years and amounted to  or  and  or of net sales 
we believe that sales to this customer will continue to represent a significant portion of total net sales in future periods 
the company has experienced increased competition for its spirulina products resulting from an increasing number of suppliers of spirulina as well as from a larger portion of our sales coming from bulk product orders whose customers generally treat these products as commodities with price being the major determining factor driving their purchasing decision 
we expect this competitive pricing pressure to continue in future periods and in response have focused on improving the quality of our spirulina products in support of customers who demand higher quality raw materials for their formulations 
however  fiscal spirulina sales declined  or resulting from average units sold and average unit sales prices  decreasing approximately and  respectively  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal  we had experienced an increase in average unit price of approximately as compared to the prior year with a slight increase in the number of units sold 
at march  our backlog of spirulina orders totaled approximately  and such backlog at the end of fiscal was  the majority of these orders were filled in the first quarter of the subsequent fiscal year 
natural astaxanthin in fiscal  the company s sales of its natural astaxanthin products were  a decrease of from  in fiscal  and a decrease of from  in fiscal the decrease in natural astaxanthin sales for the year was primarily due to decreased bulk product unit sales  including naturose  and decreased average bulk selling prices 
in addition  declining natural astaxanthin sales results from decreased production of these products  and reduced average sales prices due to competitive pricing requirements 
the company believes it would have generated additional astaxanthin sales had production levels been consistent with prior years 
bioastin  which is a higher priced product in the human nutritional market  had declining sales of  or from fiscal  resulting from a decrease in average unit sales price of  and average sales units of 
naturose sales decreased  or from fiscal  resulting from a decrease in average sales price of  and average sales units of 
at march  our backlog of orders for all natural astaxanthin products totaled approximately  an increase of  from  at the end of fiscal due primarily to the decreased production levels and the timing of customer orders at the end of march  the majority of these orders were filled in the first quarter of the subsequent fiscal year 
the company believes that the findings of clinical trials undertaken in prior years and in this fiscal year by the company  its customers and other unaffiliated parties  taken individually and on a cumulative basis  have generated growing consumer awareness of the beneficial antioxidant and anti inflammatory properties of astaxanthin 
validation of natural astaxanthin benefits identified in such scientific studies has helped to spur demand for our natural astaxanthin products in the human nutrition market and could provide the basis for proprietary intellectual property 
the company completed and issued reports on two positive scientific clinical trials on natural astaxanthin during fiscal one study demonstrated that natural astaxanthin could lower levels of c reactive protein  an indicator of systemic inflammation and the second study showed that grip strength could be increased in those suffering from tennis elbow by consumption of natural astaxanthin 
the company plans to continue expenditures on targeted scientific trials in the future in accordance with its strategy to increase sales of natural astaxanthin products 
cost of sales our cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  was at  and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
cost of sales includes the cost of nutrients and materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs  depreciation and amortization of production equipment  buildings and leasehold improvements associated with the production of inventory units sold and other production related period costs 
the cost of sales percentage increase of points between and is due primarily to both customary and complex production variables related to astaxanthin and spirulina production 
factors also include increases in the cost of raw materials and raw material freight costs  as well as diminished demand for these products with unabsorbed related fixed production costs 
astaxanthin production during fiscal was particularly impacted by an imbalance in the complex biological processes and mechanisms involved in its growth and production 
the company feels that it has identified and is correcting the factors leading to the imbalance 
however  because complex biological processes are involved  the company cannot predict the magnitude or results of such corrective efforts 
because the company s processes are agricultural  it is important to increase astaxanthin production volumes in order to support the minimal resource levels required to sustain a large scale agricultural facility 
labor and chemical costs  coupled with other efforts  were not effective in correcting the imbalance in the factors affecting the company s biological cultivation process 
some of the labor and chemical costs were deemed to be period costs resulting from an abnormal usage of nutrients and labor efforts 
labor costs  compared to last fiscal year  increased due to hourly wage rate increases in the first quarter of the year  and also due to the additional effort required in light of the just mentioned imbalance 
the imbalance also required the company to incur additional utility costs relative to the level of product produced 
in general  the forgoing elements combined to significantly increase the cost of sales  and correspondingly reduce gross profit for the year ended march  relative to the prior fiscal year 
the cost of sales increase for fiscal year relative to fiscal was mainly due to the aforementioned factors  with imbalance in the cultivation process  and attendant additional efforts and costs 
the impact of the imbalance is discussed  in part  below spirulina production variables are normal and occur from time to time as a normal part of any agricultural business 
during the year ended march   as part of cost of sales  the company recorded non inventoriable costs of approximately  comparable non inventoriable costs recorded in fiscal were  increasing  during fiscal fiscal included an increase of period costs due to abnormal chemical  labor  and utility usage 
in addition  there was an increase in production costs associated with the company s animal nutrition market products which were not inventoriable because such costs would have exceeded the market value for the related inventory 
the cost of sales percentage increased between fiscal and in part due to the result of production variances associated with decreased astaxanthin production in response to lower orders for naturose 
in addition  the company experienced increased chemical primarily nutrient and electrical costs  with the latter also serving to increase the cost of water 
the increase in chemical primarily nutrient costs is due to several factors including increased usage due to weather and production variables as well as increased raw material prices 
for fiscal  with the rising cost of fuel oil  the company could incur higher electrical utility costs dependent upon the regulated public utility s ability to obtain approval for rate increases 
if electrical utility costs were to increase significantly from fiscal  the cost to manufacture its products could increase materially above prior year costs 
fresh water is critical for our natural astaxanthin production and while the company has not experienced any constraint on fresh water availability  future availability could be negatively impacted by significant growth in the local population as well as by throughput constraints on the water delivery infrastructure owned by the county of hawaii 
given the criticality of fresh water to our operations and the community  the company recycles fresh water where possible and developed additional water recycling systems during fiscal in its efforts to utilize fresh water efficiently 
for the production of bioastin  the company s natural astaxanthin product for the human nutrition market  three third party contractors are utilized for the processes of extraction  and a sole third party contractor is utilized for each of the encapsulation for gelcaps and micro encapsulation for beadlets  although these services are available only from a limited number of sources  we have the ability to use other parties if any of the current contractors become unavailable 
if pricing for any of these services significantly increases  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there have not been any significant changes in the cost of extraction or encapsulation services and none are now anticipated 
to offset increased production costs  the company seeks ways to increase production efficiencies in volume yield  potency  and quality consistent with the company s commitment to produce high value  high quality products 
however  these efforts cannot be guaranteed to achieve the desired results 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective april  the provisions of sfas no 
inventory costs an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter require that abnormal amounts of freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage be recognized as current period charges and fixed production overhead costs be allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of production facilities 
normal capacity is defined as the production expected to be achieved over a number of periods or seasons under normal circumstances  taking into account the loss of capacity resulting from planned maintenance 
companies are no longer permitted to capitalize inventory costs on the balance sheet when the production defect rate varies significantly from the expected defect rate 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations for the year ended march  unforeseen changes in any of the factors surrounding the estimates imbedded in the determination of inventory values and cost of sales could have a material impact on cost of sales 
such changes in factors and estimates include but are not limited to production levels and capacity  changes in the prices paid for raw materials  supplies  and labor  changes in yield  potency  and quality of biomass  and changes in processing or production methods 
gross profit margin the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the fiscal year ended march   down from for fiscal and for fiscal as previously described 
management expects the company s fiscal gross profit margin percentage to increase from the results reported for fiscal since the astaxanthin production variables are not expected to negatively impact gross margins in fiscal to the extent experienced in fiscal the company recognized period costs resulting from an abnormal usage of nutrients coupled with the cost of other efforts which were not effective in correcting an imbalance in the cultivation process 
producing the highest quality microalgae is a complex biological process which requires the tenuous balancing of numerous factors including microalgal strain variations  temperature  acidity  nutrient and other environmental considerations  some of which are not in the company s control 
as a result  especially for natural astaxanthin cultivation  it is difficult and time consuming to adjust  improve or correct the production process when quality levels fall below specifications 
while the company possesses the scientific knowledge and resources to correct its production processes  there are many variables involved for the company to make reliable projections concerning such efforts  however  we have identified some production variables  and as a result  we are correcting the imbalances which we believe will result in increased production yields in both quantity and quality 
there are factors which could materially diminish gross profit 
these include  but are not limited to  sales volume and mix  increases in the cost of raw materials and raw material freight costs  and production volumes below normal capacity in response to customary production variables such as weather and significant changes in demand for the company s products  and the allocation of production resources  principally the factors impacting astaxanthin and spirulina biomass production levels and rates based on the variables just mentioned 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal the point increase from to as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to two factors 
the company recorded a non cash impairment write down of production equipment and leasehold improvements of million as a result of an analysis required under sfas no 
in addition  the company incurred general and administrative expenses in conjunction with the restatement of our amended prior period annual report on form k a  for the fiscal year ended march   filed with the securities and exchange commission on february  in addition to these factors  there were costs incurred during the third quarter of fiscal meeting listing requirements with nasdaq capital market  including our one for four reverse stock split  as discussed in our december   form q filing with the securities and exchange commission on march  during fiscal  sales and marketing and research and development expenses were comparable to fiscal  and general and administrative expenses increased significantly over the company is committed to ongoing cost containment aimed at controlling its level of operating expenses  but may increase some discretionary spending in future periods as dictated by the needs of the business 
our research and development costs increased to  up from  in fiscal  and down from  in fiscal the major expenditures in research and development were for initiation of new scientific clinical trials  costs related to product registration and work aimed at increasing production yields and improving the quality and stability of such products 
our sales and marketing costs were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  such expenses decreased from fiscal  but were higher than in fiscal  primarily due to increased advertising expenditures for bulk bioastin and naturose products 
our general and administrative costs were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
compared to fiscal  fiscal expenses increased by  or due primarily to costs incurred for restatement of prior year s annual reports on form k a as of march   and the work associated with the threatened nasdaq capital market delisting issues resulting in increases in audit  attorneys  accountants and other financial fees totaling a combined  we do not expect these fees during fiscal compared to fiscal  fiscal expenses increased by due to increased personnel costs and increased regulatory compliance reporting costs 
the company periodically reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets using the methodology prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
the company also reviews long lived assets and intangible assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
such analysis under sfas no 
at march  determined that the company should record a non cash impairment loss reducing  by million  the values of certain production related equipment and leasehold improvement assets at march  accordingly  the values of the company s equipment and leasehold improvement assets as reported on the consolidated balance sheets as of march  have been reduced by the impairment loss  and the company s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended march  includes the corresponding charge of million for the impairment of equipment and leasehold improvements 
the company notes that the foregoing reduction of asset carrying values will significantly and correspondingly reduce depreciation expense in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this impairment charge 
the company expects operating expense spending will remain consistent with or moderately increase from fiscal levels after the exclusion of the previously mentioned non cash impairment write down and the restatement related costs 
increases may be necessary in research and development as new opportunities arise 
however  the company will continue to seek additional leverage from customer supported research where and as practicable 
increases in sales and marketing expenses may become necessary as the company seeks new and increased markets and market share 
whether sales and marketing expenses increase over fiscal year levels will be based on customer demand and response and customer and market opportunities that may arise 
finally  the cost of regulatory compliance including international standards iso  us food and drug manufacturing practice gmp  sarbanes oxley  and other regulatory compliance areas continue to increase 
however  the company must remain competitive in the labor market  and this may lead to some increases in general and administrative costs 
other expense the following details the amounts included in other expense in thousands interest expense on term loan agreement other interest expense other income  net total other expense the principal balance on the term loan was   and  as of march   and respectively 
the interest rate under the term loan is above the prime rate 
the prime rate as of march   and was  and  respectively 
interest expense includes amortization of debt issue costs 
other income  net includes interest earned on certain cash and cash equivalents balances and gains arising from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions of the company s japan subsidiary 
income taxes for fiscal and  the company recorded income tax benefit of  and  respectively  primarily related to hawaii state tax credits 
for fiscal  a federal and hawaii state income tax expense of  was recorded 
at march  the company had federal and hawaii state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  and  respectively 
these net operating loss benefits have been fully reserved as their utilization is not assured 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition at march   the company s working capital was  a decrease of  compared to  at march  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at march  totaled  a decrease of  from  at march  the decreases in working capital  cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments are due to cash used in operating activities primarily resulting from significant increases in general and administrative costs previously discussed  and decreased balances in accounts receivable and inventory 
the company has a term loan agreement term loan with a lender providing up to million in credit facilities  secured by substantially all the assets of the company 
the outstanding balance under the term loan as of march  is approximately  the term loan has a maturity date of may  and is payable in equal monthly principal and interest payments of approximately  the interest rate under the term loan  in absence of a default under the agreement  is the prime rate  as defined  in effect as of the close of business on the first day of each calendar quarter  plus the prime rate was at march  
the company received a waiver of relevant restrictive covenants of the term loan related to the filings of forms q for fiscal year in addition  the company has received a waiver of covenants related to delayed filing of this form k 
the company is prohibited by the term loan from declaring any cash dividends without the lender s prior written consent 
a  restricted cash deposit is held in an interest bearing restricted cash account per the terms of the term loan and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets at march  and the following table presents the company s debt and lease obligations at march  in thousands less than year years years after years total term loan interest expense on term loan operating leases total cash flows our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were   and  at march   and  respectively 
at march    of this amount represents certificates of deposit included in cash and cash equivalents 
during fiscal year  the company used cash in operating activities of  whereas during fiscal years and  the company generated cash from operating activities of  and  respectively 
the reduction in cash from operations in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is primarily due to the fiscal net loss of  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal year and net income of  in fiscal year partially offsetting the fiscal net loss of  reduced by non cash expenses of  was cash provided from decreases in accounts receivables and inventories totaling  and  and increases in accounts payable of  cash used in operating activities of  in fiscal represents a decline of  from cash provided during fiscal of  net cash of  provided by investing activities during fiscal was due to  generated from the maturity of short term investments  net of  of investment in equipment and leasehold improvements 
the capital expenditures pertain primarily to production equipment  including a cell cracking mill  and research and development equipment 
such expenditures continue to be aimed toward capital projects enhancing or maintaining our ability to respond to market demand 
depreciation and amortization expense was   and  for the years ended march   and  respectively 
for fiscal  management expects to continue to invest in equipment upgrades and leasehold improvements tied to market requirements and production efficiency 
capital expenditures are expected to approximate amounts expended in fiscal during fiscal  cash used in financing activities amounted to  representing principal payments on long term debt of  slightly reduced by proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
sufficiency of liquidity based upon our current operating plan  analysis of our consolidated financial position and projected future results of operations  we believe that our operating cash flows and expected cash balances will be sufficient to finance current operating requirements  debt service  and planned capital expenditures  for the next months 
with total working capital of million  and a current ratio of to as of march   management expects liquidity in fiscal to be generated primarily from operating cash flows 
the company has used estimates of future financial results including projected revenue  expenses  borrowings  and capital expenditures in reaching its conclusions 
such estimates are subject to change based on future results and such change could cause future conclusions to vary significantly from those presented in this form k 
variability of results the following selected quarterly financial data unaudited as of and for the periods presented highlights the significant fluctuations in operating results and financial condition that the company has experienced in the past three fiscal years ended th quarter march  rd quarter december  nd quarter september  st quarter june  in thousands fiscal net sales cost of sales operating expenses net income loss working capital fiscal net sales cost of sales operating expenses net income loss working capital fiscal net sales cost of sales operating expenses net income loss working capital the company s results of operations and financial condition can be affected by numerous factors  many of which are beyond its control and could cause future results of operations to fluctuate materially as it has in the past 
future operating results may fluctuate as a result of changes in sales volumes to our largest customers  weather patterns  increased competition  increased materials  nutrient and energy costs  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  governmental regulations and other factors beyond our control 
in addition  the company maintains product liability insurance only in limited amounts for products involving human consumption because broader product liability coverage is cost prohibitive 
a significant portion of our expense levels are relatively fixed  so the timing of increases in expense levels is based in large part on forecasts of future sales 
if net sales are below expectations in any given period  the adverse impact on results of operations may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the sales shortfall 
we may also choose to reduce prices or increase spending in response to market conditions  which may have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations

in june  the fasb ratified the consensus on emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement 
the scope of eitf no 
includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include  but is not limited to  sales  use  value added  universal service fund usf contributions and some excise taxes 
the task force affirmed its conclusion that entities should present these taxes in the income statement on either a gross or a net basis based on their accounting policy  which should be disclosed pursuant to apb opinion no 
 disclosure of accounting policies 
if such taxes are significant and are presented on a gross basis  the amounts of those taxes should be disclosed 
the consensus on eitf no 
indicates it should be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december  the company adopted eitf no 
on january  and the impact of eitf no 
had no material impact on the company s results of operations for the year ended march  application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company regularly re evaluates its judgments and estimates which are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  policies that may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity are inventory valuations  valuation of equipment and leasehold improvements and long lived assets  revenue recognition  and income taxes 
the company recognizes revenues when goods are shipped fob shipping point and when significant risks and benefits of ownership are transferred 
the company is required to state inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is defined as the sum of the applicable expenditures and charges directly or indirectly incurred in bringing inventories to their existing condition and location 
cost for inventory purposes may be determined under any one of several assumptions as to the flow of cost factors  such as first in  first out  average cost  and last in  first out 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost  which approximates first in  first out  or market 
inventory values are subject to many critical estimates  and unforeseen changes in any of the factors surrounding the estimates imbedded in the determination of inventory values and cost of sales could have a material impact on the company s results 
such changes in factors and estimates include but are not limited to production levels and capacity  changes in the prices paid for raw materials  supplies  and labor  changes in yield  potency  and quality of biomass  changes in processing or production methods  and changes in the carrying value of our inventories resulting from the prices our customers are willing to pay for our products 
equipment and leasehold improvements are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
self constructed leasehold improvements include design  construction and supervision costs 
these costs are recorded in construction in progress and are transferred to equipment and leasehold improvements when construction is completed and the facilities are placed in service 
if the company experiences impairment to its equipment or leasehold improvement  we would account for the impairment in accordance with sfas no 
pursuant to sfas no 
 long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization shall be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
during the year ended march   the company recorded an impairment charge of  the company has determined fair value based upon present values of expected future cash flows 
this technique requires the use of a variety of estimates including projected financial information  discount rates  as well as estimates of asset values many years in the future 
as such  the results from the use of this method can result in significant volatility in the results should any of these estimates or assumptions change 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
the asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards
