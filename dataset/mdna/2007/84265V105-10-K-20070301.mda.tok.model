the acquisition was accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interests as it involved the reorganization of entities under common control 
under such accounting  the financial statements of scc and minera mexico are combined on a historical cost basis for all the periods presented since they were under the indirect common control of grupo mexico during such periods 
therefore  unless otherwise noted  the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for us  including our minera mexico subsidiary  on a consolidated or combined basis for all periods 
our combined financial results may not be indicative of the results of operations that actually would have been achieved had the acquisition of minera mexico taken place at the beginning of the periods presented and do not purport to be indicative of our future results 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors 
see cautionary statements 
overview our business is primarily the production and sale of copper 
in the process of producing copper  a number of valuable metallurgical byproducts are recovered  such as molybdenum  zinc  silver  lead and gold  which we also produce and sell 
the sales prices for our products are largely determined by market forces outside of our control 
our management  therefore  focuses on production enhancement and cost control to improve profitability 
we believe we achieve these goals through capital spending programs  exploration efforts and cost reduction programs 
our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices 
a number of significant events shaped for our company 
the explosion at the pasta de conchos coal mine in february led to the death of of our miners and cast a pallor over the year 
we continue our efforts to recover their remains 
the future of this operation will be considered once we have completed this task 
lengthy strikes at some of our mexican operations reduced the year s copper production 
these strikes have been resolved and our mining operations are now operating at normal capacity 
in the fourth quarter  after an extensive drilling program  followed by a review by an independent international mining consultant  we announced a significant increase in ore reserves at our peruvian mines 
in response to a government appeal for support for regional improvement  made by the new president of peru  our company as well as the mining industry has responded positively to help with this cause 
the programs envisioned will focus initially on nutrition for young children and expectant mothers  education and health services 
our company has agreed to a five year program of contributions  starting in  with a contribution of million  calculated based on our peruvian earnings 
this amount has been deducted from the earnings of the following four years contributions could increase or decrease depending on earnings and prices 
perhaps  the most significant event s for us has been the record copper and zinc prices and the continued high silver and molybdenum prices 
the copper price resurgence  which began in late has continued through while the market price for copper has seen a decrease in late continuing into early  we believe the fundamentals for copper remain strong 
in january  we completed the modernization of the ilo a smelter  bringing the smelter into compliance with peruvian environmental rules  and completing our obligations under our pama agreement 
we discuss below several matters that our management believes are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition 
these matters include i our operating cash costs as a measure of our performance  ii metals prices  iii our acquisition of minera mexico  iv our business segments and v the effects of inflation and other local currency issues 
since our inception  we have principally maintained operations in peru 
however  in recent years  we have refocused our plans and began steps to internationalize our business and broaden our market exposure 
in  we acquired exploration properties in chile  which are being evaluated for potential exploitation 
the biggest step  in the new focus  however  is the acquisition of minera mexico  see minera mexico acquisition below 
operating cash costs an overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced 
operating cash cost is a non gaap measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies 
a reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound to the cost of sales including depreciation  amortization and depletion as presented in the statement of earnings is presented under the subheading  non gaap information reconciliation  below 
we have defined operating cash cost per pound as cost of sales including depreciation  amortization and depletion  plus selling  general and administrative charges  treatment and refining charges  less byproducts revenue and sales premiums  depreciation  amortization and depletion  workers participation and other miscellaneous charges  the peruvian royalty charge and the change in inventory levels  divided by total pounds of copper produced and purchased by us 
in our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced  we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of byproducts  principally molybdenum  zinc and silver and the premium over market price that we receive on copper sales 
we account for the byproduct revenue in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper 
we believe that our company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company  and is valued  in large part  by the investment community s view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost 
we also include copper sales premiums as a credit  as these amounts are in excess of published copper prices 
the increase over the last three years in the price of molybdenum  however  has had a significant effect on our traditional calculation of cash cost and its comparability between periods 
accordingly  we present cash costs with and without crediting the byproduct revenues against our costs 
we exclude from our calculation of operating cash cost depreciation  amortization and depletion  which are considered non cash expenses 
exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded 
workers participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre tax earnings and are also excluded 
additionally excluded from operating cash costs are items of a non recurring nature  the new peruvian royalty and in periods prior to the portion of our mine stripping costs that we capitalized 
our operating cash costs per pound  as defined  are presented in the table below for the three years ended december  we present cash costs with and without the inclusion of byproduct revenues 
dollars per pound operating cash cost per pound of copper produced and purchased operating cash cost per pound of copper produced and purchased without byproduct revenue a the increase decrease in the cash costs per pound of copper produced and purchased including byproduct revenue in and is attributable to higher byproducts prices in and higher cost of purchased material in the credit for molybdenum sales amounted to per pound  per pound and per pound  in  and  respectively 
the credit to the cost for zinc sales amounted to per pound  per pound and per pound in  and  respectively 
the increase in the byproduct credit in the year is largely driven by price improvements 
in the year the increased credit for zinc was largely offset by the decrease in the molybdenum credit 
in the year  both the molybdenum sales volume and sales prices were approximately lower 
the cash cost without byproduct revenue increased in and as a result of cost increases 
the increasingly higher copper prices in and increased our computation of cash cost  as we include in our calculation the cost of purchased metal 
the higher value and thus the higher cost of copper in these years increased our cash cost by in and by a further in significant strike activity at some of our mexican properties required us to purchase larger quantities of third party copper in also the cost of fuel products  electricity and other supplies increased in both and additionally  our operating cash costs increased in as a result of the eitf consensus  which we adopted on january  and is described below under critical accounting policies and estimates capitalized mine stripping costs 
if we had applied this consensus in and our per pound operating cash cost would have increased by and  respectively 
metals prices the profitability of our operations is dependent on  and our financial performance is significantly affected by  the international market prices for the products we produce  especially for copper  molybdenum  zinc and silver 
metals prices historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors  which affect each commodity to varying degrees  include international economic and political conditions  levels of supply and demand  the availability and cost of substitutes  inventory levels maintained by producers and others and  to a lesser degree  inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates 
in addition  the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short term changes due to speculative activities 
we are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices 
assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved  that tax rates are unchanged and giving no effects to potential hedging programs  metal price sensitivity factors would indicate the estimated change in net earnings resulting from metal price changes in as provided in the table below copper molybdenum zinc silver change in metal prices per pound except silver per ounce change in net earnings in millions minera mexico acquisition in april   we acquired minera mexico from a subsidiary of grupo mexico  our controlling stockholder 
at the time of the acquisition minera mexico was the largest mining company in mexico and the eleventh largest copper producer in the world on a stand alone basis 
we exchanged  newly issued shares of our common stock for the outstanding shares of minera mexico s direct majority stockholder  and minera mexico became our owned subsidiary 
as a part of this transaction  on march   we paid a special transaction dividend of million to all of our stockholders 
upon completion of the merger  grupo mexico increased its indirect beneficial ownership of our capital stock from approximately to approximately 
in october  in another transaction we acquired  shares of minera mexico from grupo mexico for million 
this increased our holdings in minera mexico to 
a we are now in the process of integrating two companies that had previously been affiliated but operated independently 
with this acquisition  based on the then current data  we increased our total copper reserves by over and increased our annual copper production by approximately 
business segments our company operates in a single industry  the copper industry 
with the acquisition of minera mexico in april  we determined that to effectively manage our business we needed to focus on three operating segments 
these segments are our peruvian operations  our mexican open pit operations and our mexican underground operations  known as our immsa unit 
our peruvian operations include the toquepala and cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants  industrial railroad and port facilities which service both mines 
our mexican open pit operations include la caridad and cananea mine complexes  the smelting and refining plants and support facilities which service both mines 
our immsa unit includes five underground mines that produce zinc  lead  copper  silver and gold  a coal and coke mine  and several industrial processing facilities for zinc  copper and silver 
segment information is included in our review of results of operations and also in note of our consolidated combined financial statements 
inflation and devaluation of the peruvian nuevo sol and the mexican peso our functional currency is the us dollar 
portions of our operating costs are denominated in peruvian nuevos soles and mexican pesos 
since our revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars  when inflation deflation in peru or mexico is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the nuevo sol or the peso  respectively  to the dollar  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to the extent that the inflation devaluation effects are passed onto us by our suppliers or reflected in our wage adjustments 
in addition  the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in nuevos soles or pesos can be affected by devaluation of the nuevo sol or the peso  resulting in a remeasurement loss in our financial statements 
recent inflation and devaluation rates are provided in the table below 
year ended december  peru peruvian inflation rate nuevo sol dollar appreciation devaluation rate mexico mexican inflation rate peso dollar appreciation devaluation rate expansion and modernization program we made capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively  and we expect to make capital expenditures  of approximately million in in general  the capital expenditures and projects described below are intended to contribute to further vertical integration of our operations by increasing the capacity for production of refined metal products 
a the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for the years ended december   and year ended december  dollars in millions projects ilo smelter modernization la caridad sx ew plant toquepala crushing  conveying system for leachable material san martin  santa b rbara  charcas and nueva rosita units 
pasta de conchos mine la caridad smelter  sulfuric acid plant and refinery toquepala concentrator expansion cananea sx ew plant new copper filter at toquepala tailings disposal quebrada honda dam new cuajone leaching pad pls dams at huanaquera total project expenditures replacement capital expenditures mexico peru total replacement expenditures total capital expenditures set forth below are descriptions of some of our current projects and expected capital expenditures 
ilo smelter modernization with the completion of this project in january  we have finished our commitments under the pama  which was executed with the peruvian government on january  with the smelter modernization project  we increased sulfur recapture over the requirement established by the pama 
the new smelter is expected to maintain production at current levels and will use advanced technology to reduce sulfur emissions  in order to achieve the main goal of the project 
the anode plant was completed and commenced its operations in january sea water intake and two desalination plants are working since august three converters were upgraded and a new one was installed and are operating 
isasmelt and converters off gas ductwork was completed 
the new oxygen plant is in operation since october and the construction of the new acid plant was completed 
spending on this project through december  was million 
excluding capitalized interest  we have budgeted million for completion of this project in toquepala leach dump project to improve cost containment and production efficiency  in we began a project at toquepala to install a crushing  conveying and spreading system at the leach dumps 
the approved budget for this project is million  with million expended through december  the project was complete at december  the new system has improved recovery at our leaching facilities and has eliminated costly truck haulage in the process 
the overland conveyors system is working with conveyors    and partially with conveyor in the production line 
the conveying reached its rated capacity of  ton hr 
in september the construction of the ramp will continue until final completion of the project  expected in march cananea sx ew plant we intend to increase our cananea unit s production of copper cathodes by building a new sx ew plant  sxew iii 
the plant will produce copper cathodes of astm grade or lme grade a 
the project includes the installation of storage for deliverables required for operation of the plant and the installation of an emergency power plant and a fire protection system 
the project is currently underway and when completed in  we expect to produce  tons per year of electrowon cathodes 
a other expenditures tailings disposal at quebrada honda the engineering study was completed and the capital cost was estimated 
procurement for the main equipment  with long lead time was started 
a pre feasibility study for the los chancas project  by independent consultants  is under way with completion expected in the second quarter of a feasibility study for tia maria project was awarded to bechtel and is expected in the third quarter of the dam project at huanaquera is for the construction of a pls collection dam for the toquepala leaching facility 
at year end this project has reached approximately progress 
the budget for this project including acid addition is million  million of which was expended as of december  potential projects we have a number of projects that we may develop in the future 
we evaluate new projects on the basis of our long term corporate objectives  expected return  environmental needs  required investment and estimated production  among other considerations 
we have defined three generations of capital projects as follows first generation projects that we are planning 
this generation includes four projects the cananea iii sx ew plant  an expansion of the cananea concentrator  a new molybdenum circuit at cananea and an sx ew facility at tia maria 
second generation possible projects requiring further study 
this generation includes projects which represent significant brownfield expansions and are intended to increase our production 
the company s board will be evaluating the investment in these projects in line with their expected returns  the metal market price performance and the operating and capital costs 
projects in this generation include an expansion of the cuajone concentrator and a conveyor system for cuajone leaching  a toquepala concentrator expansion  expansion of productive capacity at the ilo smelter and refinery and a new cananea concentrator 
third generation projects that are attractive but will require significant additional evaluation 
this generation includes two greenfield projects el arco and los chancas exploration properties 
we believe that these two properties could add  tons of annual copper production  in concentrate and sx ew copper 
in december we announced our plans for a megawatt power generation plant in mexico to supply our own facilities 
we anticipate that the project will be built and managed by an independent power company and our obligation will be the supply of coal and an agreement to use the power output 
we expect this plant will give us the ability to better control the cost of our energy requirements  which is a major element of our operating costs 
the project is expected to be finished in  it is expected to create nearly permanent jobs   jobs during the construction stage and will exceed mexican and international environmental standards 
the above information about potential projects are estimates only 
we cannot make any assurance that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks  are based upon our consolidated combined financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparation of these consolidated combined financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the a financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared 
changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate  which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management 
areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include ore reserves  revenue recognition  estimated mine stripping ratios  leachable material and related amortization  the estimated useful lives of fixed assets  asset retirement obligations  litigation and contingencies  valuation allowances for deferred assets  fair value of financial instruments and inventory obsolescence 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
ore reserves for purposes of our long term planning  we use metal price assumptions of per pound for copper and per pound for molybdenum 
these prices are intended to approximate average prices over the long term 
ore reserves based on these prices are the basis for our internal planning  including the preparation of the mine plans for our mines 
our management uses these price assumptions  as it believes these prices reflect the full price cycle of the metals market 
however  pursuant to sec guidance  the reserves information in this report is calculated using average metals prices over the most recent three years  except as otherwise stated 
we refer to these three year average metals prices as current average prices 
our current average prices for copper are calculated using prices quoted by comex  and our current average prices for molybdenum are calculated according to platt s metals week 
unless otherwise stated  reserves estimates in this report use per pound for copper and per pound for molybdenum  both current average prices as of december  the current average per pound prices for copper and molybdenum were and  respectively  as of december  and and  respectively  as of december  certain financial information is based on reserve estimates calculated on the basis of current average prices 
this includes amortization of mine development and intangible assets  and for years prior to the amount of mine stripping that was capitalized and units of production amortization of capitalized mine stripping 
for our peruvian mines  commencing in  and for our mexican operations commencing in we have used reserve estimates based on current average metals prices as of the most recent year then ended to determine these items 
in the case of prior periods we have used reserves estimates based on a price assumption of per pound of copper and per pound of molybdenum 
leachable material at one of our mexican mines  we capitalize the cost of materials with low copper content extracted during the mining process leachable material  which is collected in leach dumps 
the amortization of the capitalized cost is determined based on the depletion period of the leach dumps  which is estimated to be five years 
if we were to have expensed all capitalized leaching costs associated with this mining operation as incurred  net operating cost would have increased by million  million and million for the years  and capitalized mine stripping costs in carrying out our mining operations  we are required to remove waste material to access mineral deposits 
because the concentration of mineral deposits is not evenly distributed throughout the ore body  there are periods during the life of the mine in which we mine more waste as compared to ore produced  and periods during which we mine less waste as compared to ore produced 
these mining costs are commonly referred to as stripping costs 
a using our ore reserve calculations  our mine engineers have calculated a life of mine stripping ratio 
in years prior to  when current mine stripping was in excess of the life of mine stripping ratio a portion of our mine production cost was capitalized 
conversely  in periods when the actual ratio was less than the life of mine stripping ratio  we reduced the capitalized mine stripping 
in  the emerging issues task force of the fasb reached a consensus that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs that should be included in the costs of the inventory produced extracted during the period that the stripping costs are incurred 
this consensus was ratified by the fasb and became effective for us in on january   we adopted this consensus and recorded a charge to retained earnings of million 
if we were to have charged all stripping cost to inventory produced in the years and  our net operating cost would have decreased increased by million and million  respectively 
asset retirement obligation our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment 
accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
these estimates are based in part on our inflation and credit rate assumptions 
actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated 
additionally  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation 
we further discuss asset retirement obligation in note to our consolidated combined financial statements included herein 
revenue recognition for certain of our sales of copper and molybdenum products  customers are given the option to select a monthly average lme or comex price as is the case for sales of copper products or the molybdenum oxide proprietary market price estimate of platt s metals week as is the case for sales of molybdenum products  generally ranging between one and three months subsequent to shipment 
in such cases  revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment 
the provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward copper prices based on lme or comex prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract 
in the case of molybdenum sales  for which there are no published forward prices  the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract 
deferred taxes in preparing our consolidated combined financial statements  we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
for each jurisdiction  we estimate the actual amount of currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in rate is recognized in income in the period that the change is enacted 
a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction 
if we determine that we will not a realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets  we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided  all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense 
asset impairments we evaluate our long term assets when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
our evaluations are based on business plans that are prepared using a time horizon that is reflective of our expectations of metal prices over our business cycle 
we are currently using a long term average copper price of per pound of copper and an average molybdenum price of per pound  along with near term price forecast  for through  reflective of the current price environment  for our impairment tests 
we use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life to measure whether the assets are recoverable and measure any impairment by reference to fair value 
should estimates of future copper and molybdenum prices decrease significantly  impairments could result 
the following are the provisionally priced copper and molybdenum sales outstanding at december   and year ended december  provisionally priced sales copper millions of pounds priced at per pound molybdenum millions of pounds priced at per pound provisional sales adjustments included in accounts receivable and net sales were as follows at december   and year ended december  provisional sales adjustments dollars in millions copper molybdenum total during the month of january  the market price of copper decreased 
and the molybdenum market price had a slight increase 
the effect of these changes on sales settling in january was a reduction of million in sales 
additionally  forward prices for copper as of january  also decreased  the effect of this decrease on open sales settling after january would be a further reduction of million in sales

segment sales information the following table presents the volume of sales by segment of copper and our significant byproducts  for each of the years in the three year period ended december  copper sales million pounds year ended december  peruvian operations mexican open pit mexican immsa unit intersegment elimination total copper sales a byproduct sales million pounds  except silver million ounces year ended december  peruvian operations molybdenum contained in concentrate zinc refined and in concentrate silver mexican open pit operations molybdenum contained in concentrate zinc refined and in concentrate silver immsa unit zinc refined and in concentrate silver intersegment elimination zinc silver total byproduct sales molybdenum contained in concentrate zinc refined and in concentrate silver in  the peruvian operations purchased zinc products from immsa and the mexican open pit operations for resale to its customers  there were no zinc purchases in or results of operations for the year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales our sales in were  million  compared with  million in  an increase of  million or 
the increase was attributable to significant increases in metal prices in  particularly for copper  which rose approximately  zinc and silver  which rose and  respectively 
as a result of a change in our accounting presentation  net sales includes losses on copper derivatives of million and million in and  respectively  and million on zinc derivatives in sales volumes for copper declined by million pounds in a decrease of compared with this decrease in copper sales volume  as well as a decrease in the volume of zinc and molybdenum sold reduced  somewhat  the sales price increase 
the table below presents information regarding the volume of our copper sales products 
year ended december  copper sales million pounds refined blister anode concentrates sx ew rod total mine copper production was  million pounds in  a decrease of from this decrease of million pounds included a decrease of million pounds from the mexican open pit operations  million pounds in the mexican underground a mines and an increase of million pounds from the peruvian mines 
the decrease of million pounds in the mexican open pit mines was principally the result of the day strike at la caridad mine and days of strike at the cananea mine 
the decrease of million pounds in the mexican underground mines was due to lower ore grades 
the increase of million pounds in production from the peruvian mines was principally due to higher ore grade and recovery in the cuajone mine 
molybdenum production decreased from million pounds in to million pounds in this decrease in production includes million pounds from la caridad due to the strike activity and million pounds from our peruvian operations mainly due to lower ore grade and recovery at the cuajone mine 
mine zinc production amounted to million pounds in  a decrease of million pounds or from this decrease was the result of lower production at three of immsa s zinc mines 
lower ore grades at charcas and santa barbara and reduced throughput at san martin were the prime reasons for the lower production 
production increases at two of the other immsa mines  taxco and santa eulalia  somewhat reduced the production losses 
the decrease in throughput at san martin was caused by a day strike in the first half of the increases in throughput at taxco and santa eulalia were caused by increased operating days at taxco  days were lost due to strike in and the increase at santa eulalia was caused as production ramped up after a prolonged shutdown 
santa eulalia restarted operations at the end of after a three year shutdown 
a fire at the san luis potosi zinc refinery in the first quarter of  reduced refined zinc production in  we were  however  able to sell zinc concentrates on favorable terms until the refinery was fully operational  which occurred by the end of the third quarter of copper made up of net sales in compared with in sales of byproducts in totaled  million compared with  million in  a decrease of 
the decrease is principally attributable to the decrease in the volume and sales prices for molybdenum 
the decrease in molybdenum was to a great extent reduced by the improved prices for zinc and silver  which increased by and  respectively 
the table below provides the sales of our byproducts as a percentage of our total net sales 
year ended december  byproduct sales as a percentage of total net sales molybdenum zinc silver other byproducts total cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  amortization and depletion our cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  amortization and depletion in was  million  compared with  million in  an increase of million  or 
the principal element of the cost of sales increase is the higher value of copper purchased in which increased our cost of sales by million over cost of sales in also had an increase of million in peruvian mining royalties and an increase of million in workers participation 
in addition  cost of sales also increased in due to the requirement of eitf which prohibits the capitalization of mine stripping costs at our operating mines 
as such  this cost is now included in cost of sales 
the practice of capitalizing mine stripping cost in reduced cost of sales by approximately million 
a selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expense in was million  compared with million in  an increase of million  million of which was in our mexican operations 
the mexican increase is principally due to higher labor costs of million and higher professional fees of million 
depreciation  amortization and depletion our depreciation  amortization and depletion expense in was million  compared with million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease was due to the change in accounting for mine stripping cost 
depreciation  amortization and depletion in  included amortization of million of capitalized mine stripping 
a increase in depreciation related to replacement capital expenditures reduced the impact of the accounting change 
exploration exploration expense in was million  compared with million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease was principally as a result of million of lower drilling costs in our mexican operations  mainly at la caridad due to strikes  million of higher investment at coimolache and tantahuatay projects net of a decrease of million in drilling cost at the tia maria project in peru 
interest expense interest expense in was million compared with million in  an increase of million 
our currently paid interest expense increased in principally as a result of an increase in our debt outstanding 
however  included in there was million for the write off of previously capitalized debt issuance cost for financings prepaid in such years 
with respect to our financing programs reference is made to liquidity and capital resources for a further discussion of this matter 
capitalized interest capitalized interest in was million  compared with million in  an increase of million 
this increase is largely due to the ilo smelter modernization project  on which we capitalized million 
interest income interest income in was million  compared with million in  an increase of million 
our interest income increased principally as a result of higher interest rates on short term securities and significantly higher invested balances 
loss on debt prepayments loss on debt prepayments in was million  compared with million in  a decrease of million 
in and we paid a premium of million and million  respectively in the yankee bonds repurchase 
in addition in we paid a penalty of million for the prepayment of million of peruvian bonds 
loss gain on derivative instruments loss on derivatives instruments in was million  compared with a gain of million in gain or losses on copper and other metal derivatives are included in the net sales line and gain or losses on gas derivatives are included in the cost of sales line of the consolidated combined statement of earnings 
the loss of million in is a fair value adjustment made on investments made by the company in a gain on disposal of property gain on disposal of property in was million  compared with million in these amounts include gain from the sale of non core property of our mexican operation

results of operations for the year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales our sales in were  million  compared with  million in  an increase of million or the increase was attributable to significant increases in metal prices in  particularly for copper  which rose approximately  and molybdenum  which rose 
net sales in includes a loss on copper derivatives of million 
sales volumes for copper declined by million pounds in a decrease of compared with this decrease in copper sales volume  as well as a decrease in the volume of silver sold  was to a large part offset by increases in the volume of molybdenum and zinc sales 
the table below presents information regarding the volume of our copper sales products 
year ended december  copper sales million pounds refined blister concentrates sx ew rod total mine copper production was  million pounds in  a decrease of from this decrease of million pounds included a decrease of million pounds from the peruvian open pit operations and million pounds in the mexican underground mines  which were partially offset by an increase of million pounds from the mexican open pit mines 
the decrease of million pounds in the peruvian mines was the result of lower ore grades at the cuajone and toquepala mines and lower pls grade in the sx ew operation 
the decrease of million pounds in the mexican underground mines was due to lower ore grades 
the increase of million pounds in production from the mexican open pit a mines was principally due to higher throughput in la caridad mine and higher recovery and an increase in sx ew production due to higher quantities of pls treated and higher power efficiency 
molybdenum production increased from million pounds in to million pounds in this increase in production was mainly the result of an increase in the mexican production  due to higher recoveries 
mine zinc production amounted to million pounds in  an increase of million pounds or over the period 
the increase was due to the resumption of production at immsa s santa eulalia unit 
santa eulalia s operations were suspended from through as the facilities were being modernized 
the work at the santa eulalia mine was delayed due to liquidity issues of minera mexico in some years prior to increased production from santa eulalia amounted to million pounds 
grade decreases at our other zinc mines reduced somewhat the increase from santa eulalia 
in january an electrical fire at a power sub station at the san luis potosi zinc refinery shut down operations 
after evaluating the damage  we expect to restore of the production in the second quarter of and the remaining at the end of the third quarter 
in the interim we are selling zinc concentrates 
due to a shortage of zinc concentrate  the company is able to receive favorable terms on these sales and expect that the overall return will be favorable 
in addition  insurance coverage is expected to cover the cost of repairs  equipment replacement and any loss on production 
copper made up of net sales in compared with in sales of byproducts in totaled  million compared with million in  an increase of

the principal elements of the cost of sales increase are a million increase in the cost of purchased electric power and fuel  an increase of million for mining royalties  and a million increase in worker s participation  including an adjustment of million  related to a change in the method of calculating the amount of the statutory worker s participation for the mexican workers  see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of this matter 
in addition  the higher value of copper in increased our cost of sales by million over  as we supplemented our copper production with copper acquired from third parties 
during  in response to an industry wide shortage of mine truck tires we put in place a tire rationalization program to optimize our tire usage 
the program  which includes  road maintenance improvements  closer tire maintenance monitoring  including temperature and pressure checks  and stricter truck handling procedures  was in place for and resulted in an reduction in tire consumption when compared to while we expect a the supply deficit to be resolved by mid  we continue to monitor the supply situation for this vital commodity and expect to satisfy our needs through prudent consumption practices and the development of alternative supply sources  if necessary 
we expect that cost of sales will increase in and the near future years as a result of our adoption  on january   of the eitf s  consensus related to mine stripping costs

the increases in and were for the most part the result of higher net earnings in both years  which were the result of improved sales prices for our copper  zinc and silver in each of the years 
molybdenum sales have contributed significantly to our cash flow  however  the sales a price of molybdenum in has decreased somewhat from the sales price

significant items deducted from  or added to  our earnings to arrive to operating cash flow included  depreciation  amortization and depletion of million and million of unrealized loss on derivative instruments which positively increased operating cash flow and capitalized leachable material of million which lowered our cash flow 
additionally  an increase in working capital reduced operating cash flow by million 
the working capital increase was the result of an increase of million of receivables as a result of higher copper prices  this increase was reduced by a buildup of million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities  a key component of which was the increase of million in the unpaid provision for workers participation  which is expected to be paid in the first quarter of other increases in working capital amounted million

in addition  million a gain from the sale of non core mexican properties is deducted from earning to arrive at operating cash flow  the contribution of these funds is included in investing cash flows 
changes in working capital assets and liabilities increased net operating cash flow by million 
some of these working capital accounts included some rather large changes in  the growth of accounts receivable reduced operating cash flow by million  which was the result of the improvement in metal prices from the beginning of to the end 
lme and comex copper prices increased by cents and cents during  respectively  in addition the price for molybdenum increased by per pound during improving operating cash flow was the build up of payables and accruals during  largely as a result of increased worker participation and income tax provisions driven by higher earnings  payment of which carries over into the next year 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used for investing activities was million in compared to million in we made capital expenditures of million in  including million for the ilo smelter modernization project  million for the toquepala leach dump project and million principally for equipment replacements and upgrades  of which million was for our mexican operations

this has been in response to an appeal by the new president of peru to the mining industry 
our company as well as the mining industry has responded positively to help with this cause 
the programs envisioned will focus initially on nutrition for young children and expectant mothers  education and health services 
our company has a program of contributions  starting in  with a contribution of about million  calculated based on peruvian earnings 
this non tax deductible amount has been taken from our earnings 
the following four years contributions could increase or decrease depending on earnings and copper prices 
in june  the peruvian congress enacted legislation imposing a royalty charge to be paid by mining companies in favor of the regional governments and communities where mining resources are located 
under this law  we are subject to a to charge  based on sales  applicable to the value of the concentrates produced at our toquepala and cuajone mines 
we made a provision of million  million and million in  and respectively  for this charge  which went into effect as of june  during and we made payments of million and million  respectively  related to this charge 
in addition  the constitutional tribunal stated that this charge applied to all concessions held in the mining industry 
we believe that this interpretation is incorrect and intend to protest an imposition of the royalty charge on our sx ew production  which is operating under a tax stability agreement guaranty and promotional measures for investment contract 
provisions made by the company for the royalty charge do not include approximately million of additional potential liability relating to its sx ew production from june  through december  a it is anticipated that the royalty charge will have an adverse effect on our operating income and cash flow 
while our combined financial results show a positive cash position over the past three years  our minera mexico subsidiary  which we acquired on april   has faced challenges to its liquidity as a result of low metals prices in previous years 
these challenges resulted in its noncompliance with certain debt covenants in and in april minera mexico restructured certain of its indebtedness  entering into a common agreement among minera mexico  minera mexico s principal subsidiaries as guarantors and the holders of such indebtedness 
minera mexico paid amounts owing under this agreement with proceeds from a new credit facility established in october see financing below 
in may  the mexican supreme court rendered a decision that changed the method of computing the amount of statutory workers profit sharing required to be paid by some mexican companies  including our minera mexico subsidiary 
the supreme court s ruling in effect prohibited the application of net operating loss carryforwards in computing the income used as the base for determining the workers profit sharing amounts 
we recognized in our results of operations a charge of million for workers profit participation related to in addition  the ruling may affect our future results of operations and liquidity to the extent we pay higher workers profit sharing amounts

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk a portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates and accordingly is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would also result in gains or losses in the market value of our fixed rate debt portfolio due to differences in market interest rates and the rates at the inception of the debt agreements 
based upon our indebtedness at december   a change in interest rates of one percent or basis points would impact net income and cash flows by million annually 
we are also exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates as certain costs incurred are in currencies other than our functional currency 
to manage the volatility related to the risk  we may enter into forward exchange contracts  currency swaps or other currency hedging arrangements 
we have only had limited involvement with derivative instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 
we are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metal prices 
assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved  that tax rates are unchanged  and giving no effects to potential hedging programs metal price sensitivity factors would indicate estimated change in net earnings resulting from metal price changes in as provided in the table below 
copper molybdenum zinc silver change in metal prices per pound except silver per ounce change in net earnings in millions the company occasionally uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to market a risk from changes in commodity prices  interest rate and exchange rate risk exposures and to enhance return on assets 
the company generally does not enter into derivative contracts unless it anticipates a future activity that is likely to occur that will result in exposing the company to market risk 
copper and zinc swaps transactions under these metal price protection programs are not accounted for as hedges under sfas no 
and are adjusted to fair market value based on the metal prices as of the last day of the respective reporting period with the gain or loss recorded in net sales on the consolidated combined statement of earnings 
in  the company changed its accounting classification policy to recognize gains or losses on metal price derivatives in net sales 
the company believes that this income statement classification reflects better the intention of this price protection program 
before  the change in the fair market value of our derivative instruments was accounted for in a separate non operating income statement line item 
prior year gains and losses have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
during and the company entered into short copper swap contracts to protect a portion of its copper production 
in the company entered into swap contracts for  metric tons of its copper production for future sales at a weighted average price of cents per pound and during the company entered swap contracts for  metric tons of copper at a weighted average price of cents per pound 
related to the settlement of these copper swap contracts the company recorded losses of million and million in and  respectively 
these losses were recorded in net sales on the consolidated combined statement of earnings 
also  these losses were recorded in net earnings in operating activities of the consolidated combined statement of cash flows

in this respect  the company recorded a gain of million which was credited to the production cost of at december   the company held long fixed price swap contracts for  mmbtus per day at a fixed price of per mmbtu for the first three months of to protect the company s production cost from the uncertainty and high volatility of energy prices during the winter season 
exchange rate derivatives  us dollar mexican peso contracts because more than of our sales collections in mexico are in us dollars and many of our costs are in mexican pesos  during the company entered into zero cost derivatives contracts with the purpose of protecting  within a range  against an appreciation of the mexican peso to the us dollar 
in these contracts if the exchange rate settles at or below the barrier  the company does not sell dollars  if the exchange rate settles above the barrier price established in the contract  the company sells dollars at the strike price established in the contract 
in  the exercise of these zero cost derivative contracts resulted in a gain of million  which was recorded as a gain on derivative instruments on the consolidated combined statement of earnings

due to the short term nature of the investments  book value is deemed to approximate fair value 
certain of these investments are indexed to scc common stock while others are indexed to certain bond pools 
both types of indexation clauses could cause the principal of the investment to be reduced if the established ranges are breached 
these indexation clauses have been deemed to be bifurcated embedded derivatives and have been subject to valuation using a binomial model 
at december   valuing the embedded derivatives at fair value resulted in a liability of million
