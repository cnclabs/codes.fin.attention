item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in financial statements and supplementary data 
general newcastle investment corp 
is a real estate investment and finance company 
we invest in real estate securities  loans and other real estate related assets 
in addition  we consider other opportunistic investments which capitalize on our manager s expertise and which we believe present attractive risk return profiles and are consistent with our investment guidelines 
we seek to deliver stable dividends and attractive risk adjusted returns to our stockholders through prudent asset selection  active management and the use of match funded financing structures  when appropriate  which reduces our interest rate and financing risks 
our objective is to maximize the difference between the yield on our investments and the cost of financing these investments while hedging our interest rate risk 
we emphasize asset quality  diversification  match funded financing and credit risk management 
we currently own a diversified portfolio of moderately credit sensitive real estate debt investments including securities and loans 
our portfolio of real estate securities includes commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs  senior unsecured debt issued by property reits  real estate related asset backed securities abs and agency residential mortgage backed securities rmbs 
mortgage backed securities are interests in or obligations secured by pools of mortgage loans 
we generally target investments rated a through bb  except for our agency rmbs which are generally considered aaa rated 
we also own  directly and indirectly  interests in loans and pools of loans  including real estate related loans  commercial mortgage loans  residential mortgage loans  manufactured housing loans and subprime residential loans 
we also own  directly and indirectly  interests in operating real estate 
we employ leverage in order to achieve our return objectives 
we do not have a predetermined target debt to equity ratio as we believe the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we are financing depends on the credit quality of those assets 
as of december   our debt to equity ratio was approximately to on a pro forma basis  our debt to equity ratio would have been to if the trust preferred securities we issued in march were considered equity for purposes of this computation 
also  on a pro forma basis  our debt to equity ratio would have been to after adjustment for the common stock issued in january we maintain access to a broad array of capital resources in an effort to insulate our business from potential fluctuations in the availability of capital 
we utilize a multiple forms of financing including collateralized bond obligations cbos  other securitizations  term loans  credit facility and trust preferred securities  as well as short term financing in the form of repurchase agreements and asset backed commercial paper 
we seek to match fund our investments with respect to interest rates and maturities in order to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and reduce the risk of refinancing our liabilities prior to the maturity of the investments 
we seek to finance a substantial portion of our real estate securities and loans through the issuance of debt securities in the form of cbos  which are obligations issued in multiple classes secured by an underlying portfolio of securities 
our cbo financings offer us the structural flexibility to buy and sell certain investments to manage risk and  subject to certain limitations  to optimize returns 
market considerations our ability to maintain our dividends and grow our business is dependent on our ability to invest our capital on a timely basis at yields which exceed our cost of capital 
the primary market factor that bears on this is credit spread 
generally speaking  tightening credit spreads increase the unrealized gains on our current investments and reduce our financing costs  but reduce the yields available on potential new investments  while widening credit spreads reduce the unrealized gains on our current investments or cause unrealized losses and increase our financing costs  but increase the yields available on potential new investments 
in credit spreads on real estate securities tightened to historical lows  before widening in in  these spreads tightened once again 
this tightening of credit spreads and increasing interest rates caused the net unrealized gains on our securities and derivatives  recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  and therefore our book value per share to increase on a net basis from december  to december  in addition  trends in market interest rates continue to also affect our operations  although to a lesser degree due to our match funded financing strategy 
interest rates had been historically low throughout  before rising in and continuing to increase in interest rates  as well as property values and other factors  influence the prepayment rates on our investments 
higher prepayment rates can hinder our ability to deploy capital in a timely manner  thereby reducing our return on equity  which occurred in we continue to pursue opportunistic investments within our investment guidelines that offer a more attractive risk adjusted return  including investments in subprime mortgage loans and manufactured housing loans which we expect to generate a net  loss adjusted yield in the high teens 
if credit spreads widen and interest rates continue to increase  we expect that our new investment activities will benefit and our earnings will increase  although our net book value per share and the ability to realize gains from existing investments may decrease 
certain aspects of these effects are more fully described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations interest rate  credit and spread risk as well as in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
formation and organization we were formed in as a subsidiary of newcastle investment holdings corp 
referred to herein as holdings 
prior to our initial public offering  holdings contributed to us certain assets and liabilities in exchange for approximately million shares of our common stock 
our operations commenced in july in may  holdings distributed to its stockholders all of the shares of our common stock that it held  and it no longer owns any of our common equity 
the following table presents information on shares of our common stock issued since our formation year shares issued range of issue prices net proceeds millions formation n a n a december  january excludes prices of shares issued pursuant to the exercise of options and of shares issued to newcastle s independent directors 
as of december   approximately million of our shares of common stock were held by our manager  through its affiliates  and principals of fortress 
in addition  our manager  through its affiliates  held options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at december  we are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 
as such  we will generally not be subject to us federal income tax on that portion of our income that is distributed to stockholders if we distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our stockholders by prescribed dates and comply with various other requirements 
we conduct our business by investing in three primary business segments i real estate securities and real estate related loans  ii residential mortgage loans and iii operating real estate 
our discontinued operations include the operations of properties which have been sold or classified as real estate held for sale pursuant to sfas no 
for more information on these properties  see note of our consolidated financial statements which appear in financial statements and supplementary data 
net proceeds from the sales of such properties have been redeployed to other investments which better meet our strategic objectives 
revenues attributable to each segment are disclosed below unaudited in thousands 
for the year ended real estate securities and real estate related loans residential mortgage loans operating real estate unallocated total december  december  december  taxation we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust  or reit  under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner 
our current and continuing qualification as a reit depends on our ability to meet various tax law requirements  including  among others  requirements relating to the sources of our income  the nature of our assets  the composition of our stockholders  and the timing and amount of distributions that we make 
as a reit  we will generally not be subject to us federal corporate income tax on our net income that is currently distributed to stockholders 
we may  however  nevertheless be subject to certain state  local and foreign income and other taxes  and to us federal income and excise taxes and penalties in certain situations  including taxes on our undistributed income 
in addition  our stockholders may be subject to state  local or foreign taxation in various jurisdictions  including those in which they or we transact business or reside 
the state  local and foreign tax treatment of us and our stockholders may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment 
if  in any taxable year  we fail to satisfy one or more of the various tax law requirements  we could fail to qualify as a reit 
in addition  if newcastle investment holdings failed to qualify as a reit and we are treated as a successor to newcastle investment holdings  this could cause us to likewise fail to qualify as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit for a particular tax year  our income in that year would be subject to us federal corporate income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax  and we may need to borrow funds or liquidate certain investments in order to pay the applicable tax  and we would not be compelled by the code to make distributions 
unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  we would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost 
although we currently intend to operate in a manner designed to qualify as a reit  it is possible that future economic  market  legal  tax or other developments may cause us to fail to qualify as a reit  or may cause our board of directors to revoke the reit election 
application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
management believes that the estimates and assumptions utilized in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prudent and reasonable 
actual results have been in line with management s estimates and judgements used in applying each of the accounting policies described below 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in note to our consolidated financial statements  which appear in financial statements and supplementary data 
the following is a summary of our accounting policies that are most effected by judgments  estimates and assumptions 
variable interest entities in december  financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
r consolidation of variable interest entities was issued as a modification of fin fin r  which became effective in the first quarter of  clarified the methodology for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity vie and the methodology for assessing who is the primary beneficiary of a vie 
vies are defined as entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
a vie is required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary  and only its primary beneficiary  which is defined as the party who will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses or receive a majority of the expected residual returns as a result of holding variable interests 
prior to the adoption of fin r  we consolidated our existing cbo transactions the cbo entities because we owned the entire equity interest in each of them  representing a substantial portion of their capitalization  and we controlled the management and resolution of their assets 
we have determined that certain of the cbo entities are vies and that we are the primary beneficiary of each of these vies and have therefore continued to consolidate them 
we have also determined that the application of fin r did not result in a change in our accounting for any other entities which were previously consolidated 
however  it did cause us to consolidate one entity which was previously not consolidated  ich cmo  as described below under liquidity and capital resources 
we will continue to analyze future cbo entities  as well as other investments  pursuant to the requirements of fin r 
these analyses require considerable judgment in determining the primary beneficiary of a vie since they involve estimated probability weighting of subjectively determined possible cash flow scenarios 
the result could be the consolidation of an entity acquired or formed in the future that would otherwise not have been consolidated or the non consolidation of such an entity that would otherwise have been consolidated 
valuation and impairment of securities we have classified our real estate securities as available for sale 
as such  they are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
fair value is based primarily upon broker quotations  as well as counterparty quotations  which provide valuation estimates based upon reasonable market order indications or a good faith estimate thereof 
these quotations are subject to significant variability based on market conditions  such as interest rates and credit spreads 
changes in market conditions  as well as changes in the assumptions or methodology used to determine fair value  could result in a significant increase or decrease in our book equity 
we must also assess whether unrealized losses on securities  if any  reflect a decline in value which is other than temporary and  accordingly  write the impaired security down to its value through earnings 
for example  a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary if it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a security which was not impaired at acquisition  or if we do not have the ability and intent to hold a security in an unrealized loss position until its anticipated recovery if any 
temporary declines in value generally result from changes in market factors  such as market interest rates and credit spreads  or from certain macroeconomic events  including market disruptions and supply changes  which do not directly impact our ability to collect amounts contractually due 
we continually evaluate the credit status of each of our securities and  if necessary  the collateral supporting our securities 
this evaluation includes a review of the credit of the issuer of the security if applicable  the credit rating of the security  the key terms of the security including credit support  debt service coverage and loan to value ratios  the performance of the pool of underlying loans and the estimated value of the collateral supporting such loans  including the effect of local  industry and broader economic trends and factors 
these factors include loan default expectations and loss severities  which are analyzed in connection with a particular security s credit support  as well as prepayment rates 
the result of this evaluation is considered in relation to the amount of the unrealized loss and the period elapsed since it was incurred 
significant judgment is required in this analysis 
revenue recognition on securities income on these securities is recognized using a level yield methodology based upon a number of cash flow assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies 
such assumptions include the rate and timing of principal and interest receipts which may be subject to prepayments and defaults 
these assumptions are updated on at least a quarterly basis to reflect changes related to a particular security  actual historical data  and market changes 
these uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events and economic and market conditions  which may alter the assumptions 
for securities acquired at a discount for credit losses  the net income recognized is based on a loss adjusted yield whereby a gross interest yield is recorded to interest income  offset by a provision for probable  incurred credit losses which is accrued on a periodic basis to provision for credit losses 
the provision is determined based on an evaluation of the credit status of securities  as described in connection with the analysis of impairment above 
a rollforward of the provision  if any  is included in note to our consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data 
valuation of derivatives similarly  our derivative instruments are carried at fair value pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
fair value is based on counterparty quotations 
to the extent they qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 net unrealized gains or losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  otherwise  they are reported currently in income 
to the extent they qualify as fair value hedges  net unrealized gains or losses on both the derivative and the related portion of the hedged item are reported currently in income 
fair values of such derivatives are subject to significant variability based on many of the same factors as the securities discussed above 
the results of such variability could be a significant increase or decrease in our book equity and or earnings 
impairment of loans we purchase  directly and indirectly  real estate related  commercial mortgage and residential mortgage loans  including manufactured housing loans  to be held for investment 
we must periodically evaluate each of these loans or loan pools for possible impairment 
impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan  or  for loans acquired at a discount for credit losses  when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect as anticipated 
upon determination of impairment  we would establish a specific valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to earnings 
we continually evaluate our loans receivable for impairment 
our residential mortgage loans  including manufactured housing loans  are aggregated into pools for evaluation based on like characteristics  such as loan type and acquisition date 
individual loans are evaluated based on an analysis of the borrower s performance  the credit rating of the borrower  debt service coverage and loan to value ratios  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  the key terms of the loan  and the effect of local  industry and broader economic trends and factors 
pools of loans are also evaluated based on similar criteria  including trends in defaults and loss severities for the type and seasoning of loans being evaluated 
this information is used to estimate specific impairment charges on individual loans as well as provisions for estimated unidentified incurred losses on pools of loans 
significant judgment is required both in determining impairment and in estimating the resulting loss allowance 
revenue recognition on loans income on these loans is recognized similarly to that on our securities and is subject to similar uncertainties and contingencies  which are also analyzed on at least a quarterly basis 
for loans acquired at a discount for credit losses  the net income recognized is based on a loss adjusted yield whereby a gross interest yield is recorded to interest income  offset by a provision for probable  incurred credit losses which is accrued on a periodic basis to provision for credit losses 
the provision is determined based on an evaluation of the loans as described under impairment of loans above 
a rollforward of the provision is included in note to our consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data 
impairment of operating real estate we own operating real estate held for investment 
we review our operating real estate for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
upon determination of impairment  we would record a write down of the asset  which would be charged to earnings 
significant judgment is required both in determining impairment and in estimating the resulting write down 
in addition  when operating real estate is classified as held for sale  it must be recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs of sale 
significant judgment is required in determining the fair value of such properties 
accounting treatment for certain investments financed with repurchase agreements we owned million of assets purchased from particular counterparties which are financed via million of repurchase agreements with the same counterparties at december  currently  we record such assets and the related financings gross on our balance sheet  and the corresponding interest income and interest expense gross on our income statement 
in addition  if the asset is a security  any change in fair value is reported through other comprehensive income since it is considered available for sale 
however  in a transaction where assets are acquired from and financed under a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty  the acquisition may not qualify as a sale from the seller s perspective  in such cases  the seller may be required to continue to consolidate the assets sold to us  based on their continuing involvement with such investments 
the result is that we may be precluded from presenting the assets gross on our balance sheet as we currently do  and may instead be required to treat our net investment in such assets as a derivative 
if it is determined that these transactions should be treated as investments in derivatives  the interest rate swaps entered into by us to hedge our interest rate exposure with respect to these transactions would no longer qualify for hedge accounting  but would  as the underlying asset transactions  also be marked to market through the income statement 
this potential change in accounting treatment does not affect the economics of the transactions but does affect how the transactions are reported in our financial statements 
our cash flows  our liquidity and our ability to pay a dividend would be unchanged  and we do not believe our taxable income would be affected 
our net income and net equity would not be materially affected 
in addition  this would not affect newcastle s status as a reit or cause it to fail to qualify for its investment company act exemption 
we understand that this issue has been submitted to accounting standard setters for resolution 
if we were to change our current accounting treatment for these transactions  our total assets and total liabilities would each be reduced by million and million at december  and  respectively 
results of operations we raised a significant amount of capital in offerings in each of these years  resulting in additional capital being deployed to our investments which  in turn  caused changes to our results of operations 
the following table summarizes the changes in our results of operations from year to year dollars in thousands year to year increase decrease year to year percent change explanation interest income rental and escalation income gain on sale of investments other income interest expense property operating expense loan and security servicing expense provision for credit losses n a provision for losses  loans held for sale n a n a general and administrative expense management fee to affiliate incentive compensation to affiliate depreciation and amortization equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries  net income from continuing operations changes in interest income and expense are primarily due to our acquisition and disposition during these periods of interest bearing assets and related financings  as follows year to year increase interest income interest expense real estate security and loan portfolios a agency rmbs other real estate related loans subprime mortgage loan portfolio credit facility and junior subordinated notes manufactured housing loan portfolio b other c residential mortgage loan portfolio d other real estate related loans d a represents our cbo financings and the acquisition of the related collateral in the respective years 
b primarily due to the acquisition of a manufactured housing loan pool in the third quarter of c primarily due to increasing interest rates on floating rate assets and liabilities owned during the period 
d these loans received paydowns during the period which served to offset the amounts listed above

b primarily due to increasing interest rates on floating rate assets and liabilities owned during the entire period 
c these loans received paydowns during the period which served to offset the amounts listed above 
changes in loan and security servicing expenses are also primarily due to these acquisitions and paydowns 
these changes are primarily the result of the effect of the termination of a lease including the acceleration of lease termination income  the inception of a new lease including the associated free rent period  foreign currency fluctuations and the acquisition of a million portfolio of properties through foreclosure in the first quarter of these changes are primarily a result of the volume of sales of real estate securities 
sales of real estate securities are based on a number of factors including credit  asset type and industry and can be expected to increase or decrease from time to time 
periodic fluctuations in the volume of sales of securities is dependent upon  among other things  management s assessment of credit risk  asset concentration  portfolio balance and other factors 
this change is primarily the result of investments financed with total rate of return swaps which we treat as non hedge derivatives and mark to market through the income statement  which is offset by the million gain recorded in the first half of on the derivative used to hedge the interim financing of our subprime mortgage loans  which did not qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes 
this gain was offset by the loss described in below 
the increase from to is primarily the result of the acquisition of manufactured housing and residential mortgage loan pools at a discount for credit quality and million of impairment recorded with respect to the ich loans in the increase from to is primarily due to the acquisition of manufactured housing loans at a discount for credit quality which is offset by less impairment recorded with respect to the ich loans 
this change represents the unrealized loss on our pool of subprime mortgage loans which was considered held for sale at march  this loss was related to market factors and was offset by the gain described in above 
the changes in general and administrative expense are primarily increases as a result of our increased size  offset by decreased professional fees in the increases in management fees are a result of our increased size resulting from our equity issuances during these periods 
the changes in incentive compensation are primarily a result of our increased earnings  offset by ffo losses recorded with respect to the sale of properties during and the increase in depreciation is primarily due to the implementation of new information systems and the acquisition of a million portfolio of properties through foreclosure in the first quarter of the change from to is related to an interest in an llc which held a portfolio of convenience and retail gas stores that was acquired with the intent to sell 
all sales were completed in the change from to is the result of a small improvement in operating performance 
note that the amounts shown are net of income taxes on related taxable subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund and maintain investments  and other general business needs 
additionally  to maintain our status as a reit under the code  we must distribute annually at least of our reit taxable income 
our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of net cash provided by operating activities  borrowings under loans  and the issuance of debt and equity securities 
additional sources of liquidity include investments that are readily saleable prior to their maturity 
our debt obligations are generally secured directly by our investment assets 
we expect that our cash on hand and our cash flow provided by operations  as well as our credit facility  will satisfy our liquidity needs with respect to our current investment portfolio over the next twelve months 
however  we currently expect to seek additional capital in order to grow our investment portfolio 
we have an effective shelf registration statement with the sec which allows us to issue various types of securities  such as common stock  preferred stock  depository shares  debt securities and warrants  from time to time  up to an aggregate of million  of which approximately million remained available as of february  we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  specifically the repayment of our debt obligations  through additional borrowings and the liquidation or refinancing of our assets at maturity 
we believe that the value of these assets is  and will continue to be  sufficient to repay our debt at maturity under either scenario 
our ability to meet our long term liquidity requirements relating to capital required for the growth of our investment portfolio is subject to obtaining additional equity and debt financing 
decisions by investors and lenders to enter into such transactions with us will depend upon a number of factors  such as our historical and projected financial performance  compliance with the terms of our current credit arrangements  industry and market trends  the availability of capital and our investors and lenders policies and rates applicable thereto  and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
we maintain access to a broad array of capital resources in an effort to insulate our business from potential fluctuations in the availability of capital 
our ability to execute our business strategy  particularly the growth of our investment portfolio  depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain additional capital 
our core business strategy is dependent upon our ability to finance our real estate securities and other real estate related assets with match funded debt at rates that provide a positive net spread 
if spreads for such liabilities widen or if demand for such liabilities ceases to exist  then our ability to execute future financings will be severely restricted 
furthermore  in an environment where spreads are tightening  if spreads tighten on the assets we purchase to a greater degree than they tighten on the liabilities we issue  our net spread will be reduced 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through our cash flow provided by operations and our credit facility  as well as investment specific borrowings 
in addition  at december   we had an unrestricted cash balance of million and an undrawn balance of million on our credit facility 
our cash flow provided by operations differs from our net income due to several primary factors i accretion of discount or premium on our real estate securities and loans including the accrual of interest and fees payable at maturity  discount on our debt obligations  deferred financing costs and interest rate cap premiums  and deferred hedge gains and losses  ii gains and losses from sales of assets financed with cbos  iii depreciation and straight lined rental income of our operating real estate  iv the provision for credit losses recorded in connection with our loan assets  and v unrealized gains or losses on our non hedge derivatives  particularly our total rate of return swaps  as described below 
proceeds from the sale of assets which serve as collateral for our cbo financings  including gains thereon  are required to be retained in the cbo structure until the related bonds are retired and are therefore not available to fund current cash needs 
as of december  we had million of restricted cash held in cbo financing structures pending its investment in real estate securities and loans 
our match funded investments are financed long term and their credit status is continuously monitored  therefore  these investments are expected to generate a generally stable current return  subject to limited interest rate fluctuations 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure below 
our remaining investments  generally financed with short term repurchase agreements and asset backed commercial paper  are also subject to refinancing risk upon the maturity of the related debt 
see debt obligations below 
with respect to our operating real estate  we expect to incur expenditures of approximately million relating to tenant improvements in connection with the inception of leases and capital expenditures during the year ending december  with respect to one of our real estate related loans  we were committed to fund up to an additional million at december   subject to certain conditions to be met by the borrower 
as described below  under interest rate  credit and spread risk  we are subject to margin calls in connection with our assets financed with repurchase agreements or total rate of return swaps 
margin calls resulting from decreases in value related to rising interest rates are substantially offset by our ability to make margin calls on our interest rate derivatives 
we do not expect these potential margin calls to materially affect our financial condition or results of operations

our debt obligations existing at december  gross of million of discounts have contractual maturities as follows unaudited in thousands thereafter total certain of the debt obligations included above are obligations of our consolidated subsidiaries which own the related collateral 
in some cases  including the cbo and other bonds payable  such collateral is not available to other creditors of ours 
our debt obligations contain various customary loan covenants 
such covenants do not  in management s opinion  materially restrict our investment strategy or ability to raise capital 
we are in compliance with all of our loan covenants as of december  two classes of separately issued cbo bonds  with an aggregate million face amount  were issued subject to remarketing procedures and related agreements whereby such bonds are remarketed and sold on a periodic basis 
million of these bonds are fully insured by a third party with respect to the timely payment of interest and principal thereon 
two classes of cbo bonds  with an aggregate million of face amount  were upgraded to a rating of a by fitch in in october  pursuant to fin no 
r  we consolidated an entity which holds a portfolio of commercial mortgage loans which has been securitized 
this investment  which we refer to as ich  was previously treated as a non consolidated residual interest in such securitization 
the primary effect of the consolidation is the requirement that we reflect the gross loan assets and gross bonds payable of this entity in our financial statements 
in january  we closed on a term financing of our manufactured housing loan portfolio which provided for an initial financing amount of approximately million 
the lender received an upfront structuring fee equal to on the initial financing amount and is entitled to expense reimbursement of up to on the initial financing amount 
in march  a consolidated subsidiary of ours acquired a portfolio of approximately  subprime mortgage loans the subprime portfolio for billion 
this acquisition was initially funded with an approximately billion repurchase agreement 
in april  newcastle mortgage securities trust the securitization trust closed on a securitization of the subprime portfolio 
we do not consolidate the securitization trust 
we sold the subprime portfolio to the securitization trust 
the securitization trust issued billion of debt the notes 
the notes have a stated maturity of march  we  as holder of the equity of the securitization trust  have the option to redeem the notes once the aggregate principal balance of the subprime portfolio is equal to or less than of such balance at the date of the transfer 
the proceeds from the securitization were used to repay the repurchase agreement described above 
the transaction between us and the securitization trust qualified as a sale for accounting purposes 
however  of the loans which are subject to future repurchase by us were not treated as being sold 
following the securitization  we held the following interests in the subprime portfolio  all valued at the date of securitization i the million equity of the securitization trust  ii the million of retained bonds million face amount  which have been financed with a million repurchase agreement  and iii subprime mortgage loans subject to future repurchase of million and related financing in the amount of of such loans 
in march  we completed the placement of million of trust preferred securities through our wholly owned subsidiary  newcastle trust i the preferred trust 
we own all of the common stock of the preferred trust 
the preferred trust used the proceeds to purchase million of our junior subordinated notes 
these notes represent all of the preferred trust s assets 
the terms of the junior subordinated notes are substantially the same as the terms of the trust preferred securities 
the trust preferred securities may be redeemed at par beginning in april we do not consolidate the preferred trust  as a result  we have reflected the obligation to the preferred trust under the caption junior subordinated notes payable 
in may  we entered into a new million revolving credit facility  secured by substantially all of our unencumbered assets and our equity interests in our subsidiaries 
we paid an upfront fee of of the total commitment 
we will not incur any unused fees 
we simultaneously terminated our prior credit facility and recorded an expense of million related to deferred financing costs 
in august  we completed our acquisition of a manufactured housing loan portfolio and closed on a five year term financing for an initial financing amount of approximately million 
the lender received an upfront structuring fee equal to on the initial financing amount and is entitled to expense reimbursement of up to on the initial financing amount 
in november  we closed our ninth cbo financing to term finance a million portfolio of real estate securities and loans 
approximately  or million  of the debt issued  all of which is investment grade  is rated aaa 
in december  we closed a billion asset backed commercial paper abcp facility through our wholly owned subsidiary  windsor funding trust 
this facility provides us with the ability to finance our agency residential mortgage backed securities rmbs and aaa rated mbs by issuing secured liquidity notes that are rated a  p and f  by standard poor s  moody s and fitch respectively  and have maturities of up to days 
the facility also permits the issuance of subordinated notes rated at least bbb baa by standard poor s  moody s or fitch 
as of december   windsor funding trust had approximately billion of secured liquidity notes and million of subordinated notes issued and outstanding 
the weighted average maturities of the secured liquidity notes and the subordinated notes were years and years  respectively 
we own all of the trust certificates of the windsor funding trust 
windsor funding trust used the proceeds of the issuance to enter into a repurchase agreement with newcastle to purchase interests in our agency rmbs 
the repurchase agreement represents windsor funding trust s only asset 
the interest rate on the repurchase agreement is effectively the weighted average interest rate on the secured liquidity notes and subordinated notes 
under the provisions of fin r  we determined that the noteholders were the primary beneficiaries of the windsor funding trust 
as a result  we did not consolidate the windsor funding trust and have reflected our obligation pursuant to the asset backed commercial paper facility under the caption repurchase agreements subject to abcp facility 
in january  we entered into an million non recourse warehouse agreement with a major investment bank to finance a portfolio of real estate related loans and securities prior to them being financed with a cbo 
the financing bears interest at libor 
other we have entered into total rate of return swaps with major investment banks to finance certain loans whereby we receive the sum of all interest  fees and any positive change in value amounts the total return cash flows from a reference asset with a specified notional amount  and pay interest on such notional plus any negative change in value amounts from such asset 
these agreements are recorded in derivative assets and treated as non hedge derivatives for accounting purposes and are therefore marked to market through income 
net interest received is recorded to interest income and the mark to market is recorded to other income 
if we owned the reference assets directly  they would not be marked to market 
under the agreements  we are required to post an initial margin deposit to an interest bearing account and additional margin may be payable in the event of a decline in value of the reference asset 
any margin on deposit  less any negative change in value amounts  will be returned to us upon termination of the contract 
as of december  we held an aggregate of million notional amount of total rate of return swaps on reference assets on which we had deposited million of margin 
these total rate of return swaps had an aggregate fair value of approximately million  a weighted average receive interest rate of libor  a weighted average pay interest rate of libor  and a weighted average swap maturity of years

year shares issued range of issue prices per share net proceeds millions options granted to manager formation n a n a n a december  january excludes prices of shares issued pursuant to the exercise of options and of shares issued to our independent directors 
through december   our manager had assigned  for no value  options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock to certain of our manager s employees  of which approximately million had been exercised 
in addition  our manager had exercised million of its options 
as of december   our outstanding options had a weighted average strike price of and were summarized as follows held by our manager issued to our manager and subsequently assigned to certain of our manager s employees held by directors and former directors total preferred stock in march  we issued million shares million face amount of series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock the series b preferred 
in october  we issued million shares million face amount of series c cumulative redeemable preferred stock the series c preferred 
the series b preferred and series c preferred have a liquidation preference  no maturity date and no mandatory redemption 
we have the option to redeem the series b preferred beginning in march and the series c preferred beginning in october if the series c preferred ceases to be listed on the nyse or the amex  or quoted on the nasdaq  and we are not subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act  we have the option to redeem the series c preferred at their face amount and  during such time any shares of series c preferred are outstanding  the dividend will increase to per annum 
other comprehensive income during the year ended december   our accumulated other comprehensive income changed due to the following factors in thousands accumulated other comprehensive income  december  net unrealized gain on securities reclassification of net realized gain on securities into earnings foreign currency translation net unrealized gain on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges reclassification of net realized gain on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges into earnings accumulated other comprehensive income  december  our book equity changes as our real estate securities portfolio and derivatives are marked to market each quarter  among other factors 
the primary causes of mark to market changes are changes in interest rates and credit spreads 
during the year  the combination of tightening credit spreads and increasing interest rates has resulted in a net increase in unrealized gains on our real estate securities and derivatives 
we believe that our ongoing investment activities benefit in general from an environment of widening credit spreads and increasing interest rates 
while such an environment would likely result in a decrease in the fair value of our existing securities portfolio and  therefore  reduce our book equity and ability to realize gains on such existing securities  it would not directly affect our earnings or our cash flow or our ability to pay dividends 
common dividends paid declared for the period ended paid amount per share march  april june  july september  october december  january march  april june  july september  october december  january march  april june  july september  october december  january cash flow net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  it increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  these changes primarily resulted from the acquisition and settlement of our investments as described above

investing activities consisted primarily of the investments made in real estate securities and loans  net of proceeds from the sale or settlement of investments 
financing activities provided  million   million and  million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the equity issuances  borrowings and debt issuances described above served as the primary sources of cash flow from financing activities 
offsetting uses included the payment of related deferred financing costs  the purchase of hedging instruments  the payment of dividends  and the repayment of debt as described above 
see the consolidated statements of cash flows in our consolidated financial statements included in financial statements and supplementary data for a reconciliation of our cash position for the periods described herein 
interest rate  credit and spread risk we are subject to interest rate  credit and spread risk with respect to our investments 
our primary interest rate exposures relate to our real estate securities  loans  floating rate debt obligations  interest rate swaps  and interest rate caps 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities and hedges 
changes in the level of interest rates also can affect  among other things  our ability to acquire real estate securities and loans at attractive prices  the value of our real estate securities  loans and derivatives  and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets 
our general financing strategy focuses on the use of match funded structures 
this means that we seek to match the maturities of our debt obligations with the maturities of our investments to minimize the risk that we have to refinance our liabilities prior to the maturities of our assets  and to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on our earnings 
in addition  we generally match fund interest rates on our investments with like kind debt ie  fixed rate assets are financed with fixed rate debt and floating rate assets are financed with floating rate debt when appropriate  directly or through the use of interest rate swaps  caps or other financial instruments  or through a combination of these strategies  which allows us to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on our earnings 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure below 
real estate securities interest rate changes may also impact our net book value as our real estate securities and related hedge derivatives are marked to market each quarter 
our loan investments and debt obligations are not marked to market 
generally  as interest rates increase  the value of our fixed rate securities decreases  and as interest rates decrease  the value of such securities will increase 
in general  we would expect that over time  decreases in the value of our real estate securities portfolio attributable to interest rate changes will be offset to some degree by increases in the value of our swaps  and vice versa 
however  the relationship between spreads on securities and spreads on swaps may vary from time to time  resulting in a net aggregate book value increase or decline 
our real estate securities portfolio is largely financed to maturity through long term cbo financings that are not redeemable as a result of book value changes 
accordingly  unless there is a material impairment in value that would result in a payment not being received on a security  changes in the book value of our securities portfolio will not directly affect our recurring earnings or our ability to pay dividends 
the commercial mortgage and asset backed securities we invest in are generally junior in right of payment of interest and principal to one or more senior classes  but benefit from the support of one or more subordinate classes of securities or other form of credit support within a securitization transaction 
the senior unsecured reit debt securities we invest in reflect comparable credit risk 
credit risk refers to each individual borrower s ability to make required interest and principal payments on the scheduled due dates 
we believe  based on our due diligence process  that these securities offer attractive risk adjusted returns with long term principal protection under a variety of default and loss scenarios 
while the expected yield on these securities is sensitive to the performance of the underlying assets  the more subordinated securities or other features of the securitization transaction  in the case of commercial mortgage and asset backed securities  and the issuer s underlying equity and subordinated debt  in the case of senior unsecured reit debt securities  are designed to bear the first risk of default and loss 
we further minimize credit risk by actively monitoring our real estate securities and loan portfolio and the underlying credit quality of our holdings and  where appropriate  repositioning our investments to upgrade the credit quality on our investments 
while we have not experienced any significant credit losses  in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  loan and collateral defaults may increase and result in credit losses that would adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
our real estate securities are also subject to spread risk 
our fixed rate securities are valued based on a market credit spread over the rate payable on fixed rate us treasuries of like maturity 
in other words  their value is dependent on the yield demanded on such securities by the market based on their credit relative to us treasuries 
excessive supply of such securities combined with reduced demand will generally cause the market to require a higher yield on such securities  resulting in the use of a higher or wider spread over the benchmark rate usually the applicable us treasury security yield to value such securities 
under such conditions  the value of our real estate securities portfolio would tend to decline 
conversely  if the spread used to value such securities were to decrease or tighten  the value of our real estate securities portfolio would tend to increase 
our floating rate securities are valued based on a market credit spread over libor and are effected similarly by changes in libor spreads 
such changes in the market value of our real estate securities portfolio may effect our net equity  net income or cash flow directly through their impact on the amount of unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities  and therefore on our ability to realize gains on such securities  or indirectly through their impact on our ability to borrow and access capital 
if the value of our securities subject to repurchase agreements were to decline  it could affect our ability to refinance such securities upon the maturity of the related repurchase agreements  adversely impacting our rate of return on such securities 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk credit spread exposure below 
furthermore  shifts in the us treasury yield curve  which represents the market s expectations of future interest rates  would also effect the yield required on our real estate securities and therefore their value 
this would have similar effects on our real estate securities portfolio and our financial position and operations to a change in spreads 
loans similar to our real estate securities portfolio  we are subject to credit and spread risk with respect to our real estate related commercial mortgage and residential mortgage loan portfolios 
however  unlike our real estate securities portfolio  our loans generally do not benefit from the support of junior classes of securities  but rather bear the first risk of default and loss 
we believe that this credit risk is mitigated through our due diligence process and continual reviews of the borrower s payment history  delinquency status  and the relationship of the loan balance to the underlying property value 
our loan portfolios are also subject to spread risk 
our floating rate loans are valued based on a market credit spread to libor 
the value of these loans is dependent upon the yield demanded by the market based on their credit relative to libor 
the value of our floating rate loans would tend to decline should the market require a higher yield on such loans  resulting in the use of a higher spread over the benchmark rate usually the applicable libor yield 
our fixed rate loans are valued based on a market credit spread over us treasuries and are effected similarly by changes in us treasury spreads 
if the value of our loans subject to repurchase agreements or commercial paper were to decline  it could affect our ability to refinance such loans upon the maturity of the related repurchase agreements or commercial paper 
any credit or spread losses incurred with respect to our loan portfolios would affect us in the same way as similar losses on our real estate securities portfolio as described above  except that our loan portfolios are not marked to market 
accordingly  unless there is a material impairment in value that would result in a payment not being received on a loan  changes in the value of our loan portfolio will not directly affect our recurring earnings or our ability to pay dividends

margin certain of our investments are financed through repurchase agreements or total rate of return swaps which are subject to margin calls based on the value of such investments 
margin calls resulting from decreases in value related to rising interest rates are substantially offset by our ability to make margin calls on our interest rate derivatives 
we maintain adequate cash reserves or availability on our credit facility to meet any margin calls resulting from decreases in value related to a reasonably possible in the opinion of management widening of credit spreads 
funding a margin call on our credit facility would have a dilutive effect on our earnings  however we would not expect this to be material 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had one material off balance sheet arrangement 
in april  we securitized our portfolio of subprime mortgage loans 
of this transaction was treated as an off balance sheet financing as described in liquidity and capital resources

these contracts do not have fixed and determinable payments 
inflation we believe that our risk of increases in market interest rates on our floating rate debt as a result of inflation is largely offset by our use of match funding and hedging instruments as described above 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate exposure below 
funds from operations we believe funds from operations ffo is one appropriate measure of the operating performance of real estate companies 
we also believe that ffo is an appropriate supplemental disclosure of operating performance for a reit due to its widespread acceptance and use within the reit and analyst communities 
furthermore  ffo is used to compute our incentive compensation to our manager 
ffo  for our purposes  represents net income available for common stockholders computed in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items  plus depreciation of our operating real estate  and after adjustments for unconsolidated subsidiaries  if any 
we consider gains and losses on resolution of our investments to be a normal part of our recurring operations and  therefore  do not exclude such gains and losses when arriving at ffo 
adjustments for unconsolidated subsidiaries  if any  are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
our calculation of ffo may be different from the calculation used by other companies and  therefore  comparability may be limited 
funds from operations ffo is calculated as follows unaudited in thousands for the year ended december  income available for common stockholders operating real estate depreciation accumulated depreciation on operating real estate sold funds from operations ffo funds from operations was derived from our segments as follows unaudited in thousands book equity december  average invested common equity for the year ended december  ffo for the year ended december  return on invested common equity for the year ended december  real estate securities and real estate related loans residential mortgage loans operating real estate unallocated n a n a n a total preferred stock accumulated depreciation accumulated other comprehensive income net book equity unallocated ffo represents million of interest expense  million of preferred dividends and million of corporate general and administrative expense  management fees and incentive compensation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  credit spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risks that we are exposed to are interest rate risk and credit spread risk 
these risks are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
all of our market risk sensitive assets  liabilities and related derivative positions are for non trading purposes only 
for a further understanding of how market risk may effect our financial position or operating results  please refer to the application of critical accounting policies section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
interest rate exposure our primary interest rate exposures relate to our real estate securities  loans  floating rate debt obligations  interest rate swaps  and interest rate caps 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities and hedges 
changes in the level of interest rates also can affect  among other things  our ability to acquire real estate securities and loans at attractive prices  the value of our real estate securities  loans and derivatives  and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets 
while our strategy is to utilize interest rate swaps  caps and match funded financings in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations  there can be no assurance that our profitability will not be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  loan and collateral defaults may increase and result in credit losses that would adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
as of december   a basis point increase in short term interest rates would increase our earnings by approximately million per annum 
a period of rising interest rates negatively impacts our return on certain investments  particularly our floating rate residential mortgage loans 
although these loans are financed with floating rate debt  the interest rate on the debt resets prior to  and in some cases more frequently than  the interest rate on the assets  causing a decrease in return on equity during a period of rising interest rates 
when interest rates stabilize  we expect these investments would return to their historical returns on equity 
interest rate changes may also impact our net book value as our real estate securities and related hedge derivatives are marked to market each quarter 
our loan investments and debt obligations are not marked to market 
generally  as interest rates increase  the value of our fixed rate securities decreases  and as interest rates decrease  the value of such securities will increase 
in general  we would expect that over time  decreases in the value of our real estate securities portfolio attributable to interest rate changes will be offset to some degree by increases in the value of our swaps  and vice versa 
however  the relationship between spreads on securities and spreads on swaps may vary from time to time  resulting in a net aggregate book value increase or decline 
our real estate securities portfolio is largely financed to maturity through long term cbo financings that are not redeemable as a result of book value changes 
accordingly  unless there is a material impairment in value that would result in a payment not being received on a security  changes in the book value of our portfolio will not directly affect our recurring earnings or our ability to pay dividends 
as of december   a basis point change in short term interest rates would impact our net book value by approximately million 
our general financing strategy focuses on the use of match funded structures 
this means that  when appropriate  we seek to match the maturities of our debt obligations with the maturities of our investments to minimize the risk that we have to refinance our liabilities prior to the maturities of our assets  and to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on our earnings 
in addition  we generally match fund interest rates on our investments with like kind debt ie  fixed rate assets are financed with fixed rate debt and floating rate assets are financed with floating rate debt  directly or through the use of interest rate swaps  caps  or other financial instruments  or through a combination of these strategies  which allows us to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on our earnings 
our financing strategy is dependent on our ability to place the match funded debt we use to finance our investments at rates that provide a positive net spread 
if spreads for such liabilities widen or if demand for such liabilities ceases to exist  then our ability to execute future financings will be severely restricted 
interest rate swaps are agreements in which a series of interest rate flows are exchanged with a third party counterparty over a prescribed period 
the notional amount on which swaps are based is not exchanged 
in general  our swaps are pay fixed swaps involving the exchange of floating rate interest payments from the counterparty for fixed interest payments from us 
this can effectively convert a floating rate debt obligation into a fixed rate debt obligation 
similarly  an interest rate cap or floor agreement is a contract in which we purchase a cap or floor contract on a notional face amount 
we will make an upfront payment to the counterparty for which the counterparty agrees to make future payments to us should the reference rate typically one or three month libor rise above cap agreements or fall below floor agreements the strike rate specified in the contract 
should the reference rate rise above the contractual strike rate in a cap  we will earn cap income  should the reference rate fall below the contractual strike rate in a floor  we will earn floor income 
payments on an annualized basis will equal the contractual notional face amount multiplied by the difference between the actual reference rate and the contracted strike rate 
while a reit may utilize these types of derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk on its liabilities or for other purposes  such derivative instruments could generate income that is not qualified income for purposes of maintaining reit status 
as a consequence  we may only engage in such instruments to hedge such risks within the constraints of maintaining our standing as a reit 
we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes nor as a hedge against changes in credit risk 
our hedging transactions using derivative instruments also involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
the counterparties to our derivative arrangements are major financial institutions with high credit ratings with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
as a result  we do not anticipate that any of these counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies 
credit spread exposure our real estate securities are also subject to spread risk 
our fixed rate securities are valued based on a market credit spread over the rate payable on fixed rate us treasuries of like maturity 
in other words  their value is dependent on the yield demanded on such securities by the market based on their credit relative to us treasuries 
excessive supply of such securities combined with reduced demand will generally cause the market to require a higher yield on such securities  resulting in the use of a higher or wider spread over the benchmark rate usually the applicable us treasury security yield to value such securities 
under such conditions  the value of our real estate securities portfolio would tend to decline 
conversely  if the spread used to value such securities were to decrease or tighten  the value of our real estate securities portfolio would tend to increase 
our floating rate securities are valued based on a market credit spread over libor and are affected similarly by changes in libor spreads 
such changes in the market value of our real estate securities portfolio may effect our net equity  net income or cash flow directly through their impact on unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities  and therefore our ability to realize gains on such securities  or indirectly through their impact on our ability to borrow and access capital 
furthermore  shifts in the us treasury yield curve  which represents the market s expectations of future interest rates  would also effect the yield required on our real estate securities and therefore their value 
this would have similar effects on our real estate securities portfolio and our financial position and operations to a change in spreads 
our loan portfolios are also subject to spread risk 
our floating rate loans are valued based on a market credit spread to libor 
the value of these loans is dependent upon the yield demanded by the market based on their credit relative to libor 
the value of our floating rate loans would tend to decline should the market require a higher yield on such loans  resulting in the use of a higher spread over the benchmark rate usually the applicable libor yield 
our fixed rate loans are valued based on a market credit spread over us treasuries and are effected similarly by changes in us treasury spreads 
if the value of our loans subject to repurchase agreements or commercial paper were to decline  it could affect our ability to refinance such loans upon the maturity of the related repurchase agreements or commercial paper 
any decreases in the value of our loan portfolios due to spread changes would affect us in the same way as similar changes to our real estate securities portfolio as described above  except that our loan portfolios are not marked to market 
as of december   a basis point movement in credit spreads would impact our net book value by approximately million  but would not directly affect our earnings or cash flow 
margin certain of our investments are financed through repurchase agreements or total rate of return swaps which are subject to margin calls based on the value of such investments 
margin calls resulting from decreases in value related to rising interest rates are substantially offset by our ability to make margin calls on our interest rate derivatives 
we maintain adequate cash reserves or availability on our credit facility to meet any margin calls resulting from decreases in value related to a reasonably possible in the opinion of management widening of credit spreads 
funding a margin call on our credit facility would have a dilutive effect on our earnings  however we would not expect this to be material 
fair value fair values for a majority of our investments are readily obtainable through broker quotations 
for certain of our financial instruments  fair values are not readily available since there are no active trading markets as characterized by current exchanges between willing parties 
accordingly  fair values can only be derived or estimated for these instruments using various valuation techniques  such as computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
however  the determination of estimated future cash flows is inherently subjective and imprecise 
we note that minor changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these derived or estimated fair values  and that the fair values reflected below are indicative of the interest rate and credit spread environments as of december  and do not take into consideration the effects of subsequent interest rate or credit spread fluctuations
