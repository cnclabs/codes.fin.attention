executive summary general tredegar is a manufacturer of plastic films and aluminum extrusions 
descriptions of our businesses are provided on pages income from continuing operations was million cents per diluted share in compared with million cents per diluted share in gains on the sale of assets  investment write downs and other items and losses related to plant shutdowns  assets impairments and restructurings are described in results of operations beginning on page the business segment review begins on page film products in film products  net sales were million in  up versus million in operating profit from ongoing operations was million in  up compared to million in operating profit from ongoing operations excluding the estimated effects of resin pass through lag and year end lifo adjustments was million in  up versus million in volume decreased to million pounds in from million pounds in we estimate that the growth in net sales excluding the effects of the pass through of resin price changes and foreign exchange rate changes was approximately in sales and operating profit growth in were driven primarily by increased sales of high value surface protection films  elastic materials and new apertured topsheets  partially offset by lower sales of certain commodity barrier films that were dropped in conjunction with the shutdown of the plant in lagrange  georgia 
the plant was shut down in the first half of and had sales of commodity barrier films of approximately million in film products has index based pass through raw material cost agreements for the majority of its business 
however  under certain agreements  changes in resin prices are not passed through for an average period of days 
average quarterly prices of low density polyethylene resin ldpe in the us have been volatile over the last several years see the chart on page 
resin prices in europe  asia and south america have exhibited similar trends 
capital expenditures declined to million in compared with million in capital expenditures in are expected to be approximately million 
approximately half of the capital expenditures in related to expanding the production capacity for surface protection films 
these films are primarily used to protect flat panel display components during fabrication  shipping and handling 
sales of surface protection films used primarily in this application totaled approximately million in  million in and million in other capital expenditures in included capacity additions for elastic materials and a new information system  which was rolled out in us locations 
depreciation expense was million in compared with million  and is projected to be million in aluminum extrusions in aluminum extrusions  net sales were million in  up versus million in operating profit from ongoing operations was million in  up compared to million in volume increased to million pounds in  up compared to million pounds in growth in shipments in was driven by demand for extrusions used in commercial construction and hurricane protection products  partially offset by a decline in extrusions used in residential construction 
the increase in operating profit during was primarily due to higher volume and selling prices and lower energy costs energy costs were down million  partially offset by appreciation of the canadian dollar million and higher charges for possible uncollectible accounts million 

index capital expenditures in were million versus million in and are expected to be approximately million in depreciation expense was million in compared with million in  and is projected to be million in other developments consolidated net pension expense was million in  an increase of million cents per share after taxes from the net pension income of million recognized in see note beginning on page for more information 
most of this unfavorable change relates to a pension plan that is reflected in corporate expenses  net in the segment operating profit table on page we contributed million to our pension plans in and expect required contributions of million in on october   we announced changes to our us defined benefit pension and savings plans covering salaried and certain other employees 
the changes had no impact on our net income or earnings per share in the changes relating to the pension plan reduced our projected benefit obligation by approximately million as of december  in  the changes to the pension plan are expected to reduce our service cost  interest cost and amortization of prior service cost components of pension expense by approximately   and million  respectively  and the savings plan changes are expected to increase charges for company matching contributions by approximately  based on these changes and other factors  we expect pension income of million in  a favorable change of million or cents per share after taxes compared with effective december   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no   and r 
in accordance with this new standard we recognized the funded status of our pension and other postretirement plans in our balance sheet as of december   which included plan assets at fair value in excess of benefit obligations of million 
the adjustments in our balance sheet of our pension and other postretirement plans to recognize their funded status resulted in a decrease in prepaid pension cost of million  an increase in related liabilities of million  a decrease in non current deferred income tax liabilities of million and a decrease in shareholders equity of million 
prepaid pension cost and related liabilities are included in other assets and deferred charges and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
during the first quarter of  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires all stock based compensation to be expensed and accounted for using a fair value based method 
the adoption of sfas r and the granting of stock options in resulted in pretax charges for stock option based compensation of  cents per share after taxes in strong cash flows from operations after investing activities and dividends of approximately million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of approximately million resulted in a decline in net debt total debt net of cash of approximately million in consolidated net capitalization and other credit measures are provided in the financial condition section beginning on page critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies 
these policies require management to exercise judgments that are often difficult  subjective and complex due to the necessity of estimating the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

index impairment and useful lives of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill we regularly assess our long lived identifiable assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
any necessary impairment charges are recorded when we do not believe the carrying value of the long lived asset will be recoverable 
we also reassess the useful lives of our long lived assets based on changes in our business and technologies 
we assess goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  on an annual basis december of each year 
we have made determinations as to what our reporting units are and what amounts of goodwill and intangible assets should be allocated to those reporting units 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  discount rates and other factors to determine if impairment tests are met or the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
based upon assessments performed  we recorded asset impairment losses for continuing operations related to long lived identifiable assets of million in  million in and million in pension benefits we have noncontributory and contributory defined benefit pension plans that have significant net pension income developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net pension income recorded in future periods 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future payments 
the discount rate is the single rate that  when applied to expected benefit payments  provides a present value equal to the present value of expected benefit payments determined by using the aa rated bond yield curve 
in general  our liability increases as the discount rate decreases and vice versa 
our weighted average discount rate was at the end of  at the end of and at the end of  with changes between periods due to changes in market interest rates 
the compensation increase assumption affects the estimate of future payments  and was at the end of  and a lower expected return on plan assets increases the amount of expense and vice versa 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will also serve to increase the amount of pension expense 
during   and  the value of our plan assets increased due to improved general market conditions after declining in  and our expected long term return on plan assets has been since based on market and economic conditions and asset mix our expected return was in and in and prior years 
see page for more information on expected long term return on plan assets and asset mix 
see the executive summary beginning on page for further discussion regarding the financial impact of our pension plans 
income taxes many deductions for tax return purposes cannot be taken until the expenses are actually paid  rather than when the expenses are recorded for book purposes 
in these circumstances  we accrue for the tax benefit expected to be received in future years if  in our judgment  it is more likely than not that we will receive such benefits 
in addition  the amount and timing of certain current deductions which reduce taxes currently payable or generate income tax refunds require interpretation of tax laws 
in these circumstances  we estimate and accrue income tax contingencies for differences in interpretation that may exist with tax authorities 
on a quarterly basis  we review our judgments regarding income tax contingency accruals and the likelihood the benefits of a deferred tax asset will be realized 
during the periodic reviews  we must consider a variety of factors  including the nature and amount of the tax income and expense items  the current tax statutes  the current status of audits performed by tax authorities and the projected future earnings 
we believe the realization of our net deferred tax assets is reasonably assured and that our income tax contingency accruals are adequate as measured under existing accounting standards 
as circumstances change  our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets  income tax contingency accruals and net earnings are adjusted accordingly in that period 

index recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities 
the fsp is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after december  the fsp eliminates the accrual method of accounting for major maintenance activities  but continues to permit the use of the direct expensing  built in overhaul and deferral methods 
the fsp also continues to require accruals or deferrals for interim periods of annual costs that clearly benefit two or more interim periods 
we are evaluating the fsp and have not determined whether or not it will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  clarifying the accounting for uncertain tax positions 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  with earlier application encouraged 
we are evaluating the interpretation and have not determined if it will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations versus revenues

further  any indemnification payments may be limited or barred by a monetary cap  a time limitation  or a deductible or basket 
for these reasons  we are unable to estimate the maximum potential amount of the potential future liability under the indemnity provisions of these agreements

cash flows the discussion in this section supplements the information presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows on page cash provided by operating activities was million in compared with million in the increase is due primarily to improved operating results  higher deferred income taxes and lower incremental working capital investment see assets and liabilities section on page for discussion of working capital trends

net cash provided by financing activities was million in and included the refinancing of our debt in december see the assets and liabilities section beginning on page for more information 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million compared with million in the increase is due primarily to the income tax refund related to the sale of the venture capital portfolio see the business segment review beginning on page partially offset by higher primary working capital accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable needed to support higher sales

see the assets and liabilities section beginning on page regarding credit agreements and interest rate exposures 
changes in resin prices  and the timing of those changes  could have a significant impact on profit margins in film products 
profit margins in aluminum extrusions are sensitive to fluctuations in aluminum ingot and scrap prices as well as natural gas prices natural gas is the principal energy source used to operate our casting furnaces 
there is no assurance of our ability to pass through higher raw material and energy costs to our customers 

index see the executive summary beginning on page and the business segment review beginning on page for discussion regarding the impact of the lag in the pass through of resin price changes 
the volatility of average quarterly prices of low density polyethylene resin in the us a primary raw material for film products are shown in the chart below 
resin prices in europe  asia and south america have exhibited similar trends 
the price of resin is driven by several factors including supply and demand and the price of oil  ethylene and natural gas 
to address fluctuating resin prices  film products has index based pass through raw material cost agreements for the majority of its business 
however  under certain agreements  changes in resin prices are not passed through for an average period of days 
in the normal course of business  we enter into fixed price forward sales contracts with certain customers for the sale of fixed quantities of aluminum extrusions at scheduled intervals 
in order to hedge our exposure to aluminum price volatility see the chart below under these fixed price arrangements  which generally have a duration of not more than months  we enter into a combination of forward purchase commitments and futures contracts to acquire or hedge aluminum  based on the scheduled deliveries 
see note on page for more information 

index in aluminum extrusions  we hedge from time to time a portion of our exposure to natural gas price volatility by entering into fixed price forward purchase contracts with our natural gas suppliers 
we estimate that  in an unhedged situation  every per mmbtu per month change in the market price of natural gas has a  impact on the monthly operating profit in aluminum extrusions

we attempt to match the pricing and cost of our products in the same currency except in canada where about of our sales of aluminum extrusions are us dollar based and generally view the volatility of foreign currencies see trends for the euro  canadian dollar and chinese yuan in the chart below and emerging markets  and the corresponding impact on earnings and cash flow  as part of the overall risk of operating in a global environment 
exports from the us are generally denominated in us dollars 
our foreign currency exposure on income from foreign operations relates to the canadian dollar  the euro  the chinese yuan  the hungarian forint and the brazilian real 

index the relatively high percentage of us dollar priced sales in canada is partly due to the shifting of a large portion of the customers previously served by the aluminum extrusions plant in el campo  texas  in the resulting mismatch between the currency denomination of sales and costs causes lower us dollar translated profits when the canadian dollar appreciates since our costs are higher in us dollar equivalent terms while sales are mostly unaffected the opposite effect occurs when the canadian dollar depreciates in value relative to the us dollar 
we estimate that the appreciation of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar had an adverse impact on operating profit of about million in compared with  and million in compared with in film products  where we have been able to better match the currency of our sales and costs  we estimate that the change in value of foreign currencies primarily the euro and hungarian forint and to a lesser extent the chinese yuan and brazilian real relative to the us dollar had a positive impact on operating profit of about  in compared with  and  in compared with we continue to review the loading of our aluminum extrusions plants in north america to optimize production mix and minimize cost in light of the increase in the us dollar equivalent cost structure of our plants in canada
