item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this document contains forward looking statements and information that are based on the beliefs of management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to level communications  inc and its subsidiaries level or the company 
when used in this document  the words anticipate  believe  plan  estimate and expect and similar expressions  as they relate to the company or its management  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements reflect the current views of the company with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those described in this document 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
level communications  inc  through its operating subsidiaries  is primarily engaged in the communications business  with additional operations in coal mining 
communication services the company is a facilities based provider of a broad range of integrated communications services 
revenue for communications services is recognized on a monthly basis as these services are provided 
for contracts involving private line  wavelengths and dark fiber services  level may receive up front payments for services to be delivered for a period of up to years 
in these situations  level will defer the revenue and amortize it on a straight line basis to earnings over the term of the contract 
at december   for contracts where up front payments were received for services to be delivered in the future  the company s weighted average remaining contract period was approximately years 
the company separates its communications services into three separate categories core communications services  other communications services  and sbc contract services 
each category of revenue is in a different phase of the service life cycle  requiring different levels of investment and focus and providing different contributions to the company s adjusted oibda 
adjusted oibda is defined by the company as operating income loss from the consolidated statements of operations  less depreciation and amortization expense  less non cash compensation expense included within selling  general and administration expense on the consolidated statements of operations  and less the non cash portion of restructuring and impairment charges 
management of level believes that growth in revenue from its core communications services is critical to the long term success of its communications business 
at the same time  the company believes it must continue to manage effectively the positive cash flows from its sbc contract services and its other communications services including the company s mature managed modem business and its related reciprocal compensation 
core communications services includes transport and infrastructure  ip and data services  voice and vyvx video and advertising distribution services 
other communications services includes managed modem and related reciprocal compensation and legacy managed ip service business 
in  other communications services included dsl aggregation services which are no longer provided 
sbc contract services includes all the revenues related to the sbc contract services agreement contract  which was obtained in the december  acquisition of wiltel 
the company s transport and infrastructure services include colocation services  wavelength  private line  dark fiber and transoceanic services 
growth in transport and infrastructure revenue is largely dependent on increased demand for bandwidth services and available capital of companies requiring communications capacity for their own use or in providing capacity as a service provider to their customers 
these expenditures may be in the form of up front payments or monthly payments for private line  wavelength or dark fiber services 
an increase in demand may be partially offset by declines in unit pricing 
ip and data services primarily include the company s high speed internet access service and ethernet and ip virtual private network vpn services 
level s high speed internet access service is a high quality and high speed internet access service offered in a variety of capacities 
the company s vpn services permit businesses of any size to replace multiple networks with a single  cost effective solution that greatly simplifies the converged transmission of voice  video  and data 
this convergence to a single platform can be obtained without sacrificing the quality of service or security levels of traditional atm and frame relay offerings 
vpn services also permit customers to prioritize network application traffic so that high priority applications  such as voice and video  are not compromised in performance by the flow of low priority applications such as email 
the conversion from narrow band dial up services to higher speed broadband services is expected to increase demand for the company s core communications services 
revenue growth in this area is dependent on the continued increase in usage by both enterprises and consumers and the pricing environment 
an increase in the reliability and security of information transmitted over the internet and declines in the cost to transmit data have resulted in increased utilization of e commerce or web based services by businesses 
the company  however  continues to experience lower revenue growth due to price compression for its ip and data services 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in billable ip and data traffic for compared to this increase in billable ip data traffic is partially due to acquisitions made in current high levels of available capacity and the numerous companies competing in this market have resulted in a very competitive pricing environment 
in  the company continued to experience pricing pressure for ip and data services with the average price per megabyte declining approximately 
the company experienced price compression of approximately in for ip and data services 
in addition to pricing pressures  the decline in the company s average price per megabyte was attributable to higher traffic from larger customers and customers continuing to move to higher speed services with a lower price per megabyte 
the larger customers have a lower price per megabyte due to higher volume commitments 
the company continues to experience pricing pressure for those transport and infrastructure customers that require simple  low quality  point to point services  as competitors aggressively pursued this business 
however  level believes that competitors are less willing to discount these services if it requires investment in incremental capacity to meet the customer s requirements 
for those customers that provide high quality content or require a combination of transport  ip and voice solutions on a regional or national platform  level is seeing that price compression is starting to moderate and  in many cases  prices are starting to increase 
level intends to remain disciplined in its approach to pricing for its transport and ip services 
the company has developed voice services that target large and existing markets 
the company believes that the efficiencies of level s ip and optical based network  including its softswitch technology  will provide customers a lower cost alternative than the existing circuit switched networks 
the company is moving to develop both its capability to market and sell in the voice market and develop the internal systems and processes necessary to support the new services being launched 
the revenue potential for voice services is large  however  the revenues and margins are expected to continue to decline over time as a result of the new low cost ip and optical based technologies 
in addition  the market for voice services is being targeted by many competitors  several of which are larger and have more financial resources than the company 
vyvx provides audio and video programming for its customers over the company s fiber optic network and via satellite 
it uses the company s fiber optic network to carry live traditional broadcast and cable television events from the site of the event to the network control centers of the broadcasters of the event 
for live events where the location is not known in advance  such as breaking news stories in remote locations  vyvx provides an integrated satellite and fiber optic network based service to transmit the content to its customers 
most of vyvx s customers for these services contract for the service on an event by event basis  however  vyvx has some customers who have purchased a dedicated point to point service which enables these customers to transmit programming at any time 
vyvx also distributes advertising spots to radio and television stations throughout the us  both electronically and in physical form 
customers for these services can utilize a network based method for aggregating  managing  storing and distributing content for content owners and rights holders 
the company expects to continue to develop its content distribution services through the acquisition of the savvis content delivery network cdn services business savvis cdn business which it purchased in the first quarter of for million in cash 
the company believes that the addition of the savvis cdn business with its strong  broad portfolio of patents will help the company secure its commercial efforts in the heavily patented cdn market 
the company s other communications services are mature services that are not areas of emphasis for the company 
other communications services currently include managed modem  related reciprocal compensation and legacy managed ip services 
the company and its customers continue to see consumers migrate from narrow band dial up services to higher speed broadband services as the narrow band market matures 
additionally  america online  a primary consumer of the company s dial up services  announced a strategic change in its approach to its dial up internet access business that has accelerated the loss of its dial up subscribers 
during the fourth quarter of  the america online strategy began having the effect of accelerating the decline in managed modem revenues and is expected to contribute to further declines in managed modem revenue in and beyond 
the company recognized approximately million of managed modem revenue in  an approximate decline from the million of managed modem revenue recognized in the declines in managed modem revenue in have been offset to some extent by an increase in market share as a result of certain competitors exiting segments of this business in the second half of level believes that the low cost structure of its network will enable it to compete aggressively for new business in the ip based market 
level receives compensation from other carriers when it terminates traffic originating on those carriers networks 
this reciprocal compensation is based on interconnection agreements with the respective carriers or rates mandated by the fcc 
the company earns the majority of its reciprocal compensation revenue from providing managed modem services 
legacy managed ip services primarily include low speed services which utilize atm technology  as well as vpn and managed security services 
the company s legacy internet access business consists primarily of a business that was acquired in the genuity transaction in the company has elected not to pursue additional customers and to limit the capital invested in this component of its business 
the sbc contract services agreement was an agreement between sbc services inc and wiltel and was obtained in the wiltel acquisition in december recently  sbc services inc became a subsidiary of at t inc  together sbc 
wiltel and sbc amended their agreement in june to run through the company recognized approximately million of revenue under the sbc contract services agreement during the agreement provides a gross margin purchase commitment of million from december through the end of  and million from january through the end of sbc had satisfied million of the december to end of gross margin purchase commitment through december  the remaining minimum gross margin commitment under the agreement as of december  was approximately million for the period through the end of  and million from january through the end of originating and terminating access charges paid to local phone companies are passed through to sbc in accordance with a formula that approximates cost 
additionally  the sbc contract services agreement provides for the payment of million from sbc if certain performance criteria are met by level the company met the required performance criteria and recorded revenue of million in under the agreement 
level is eligible to earn another million in if it meets the performance criteria 
of the annual amounts  is based on monthly performance criteria and the remaining is based on performance criteria for the full year 
the company expects to earn the performance payment in given the expected reduction in the sbc contract services revenue and the overall increase in revenue from acquisition activity  concentration of revenue among a limited number of customers is expected to be reduced in periods subsequent to however  if level would lose one or more major customers  or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for level services  the company s communications business would be materially and adversely affected 
level s management continues to review all of the company s existing lines of business and service offerings to determine how those lines of business and service offerings assist with the company s focus on delivery of communications services and meeting its financial objectives 
this exersise takes place both with respect to integration activities and in the normal course of business 
to the extent that certain lines of business or service offerings are not considered to be compatible with the delivery of communications services or with obtaining financial objectives  level may exit those lines of business or stop offering those services 
management focuses on adjusted oibda  cash flows from operating activities and capital expenditures to assess the operating performance of the communications business 
management believes that adjusted oibda  when viewed over time  reflects the operating trends and performance of its communications business 
adjusted oibda  or a similar measure  also is an indicator of performance used by level s competitors and is used by management in evaluating relative performance 
management of level believes the introduction of new services or technologies  as well as the further development of existing technologies  may reduce the cost or increase the supply of certain services similar to those provided by level the ability of the company to anticipate  adapt and invest in these technology changes in a timely manner may affect the future success of the company 
the company completed the initial planned deployment of the next generation of optical transport technology in its north american and european networks in the fourth quarter of and early in the first quarter of  respectively 
the company has decided to deploy the technology for additional routes in north america and europe and completed the deployments on these routes in the company completed an upgrade of its ip backbone technology in the fourth quarter of level believes that this deployment of new equipment to the existing network equipment will allow the company to optimize the amount of traffic it carries over the network and lower the cost of providing services 
to expand its service offerings in europe  the company expects to invest approximately million for a dark fiber based expansion in nine european markets 
portions of this expansion were completed in and the company expects to complete the remainder of the expansion in the dark fiber is expected to replace or supplement existing wavelength capacity 
the communications industry continues to consolidate 
level has participated in this process with the acquisitions of wiltel in  progress telecom  icg communications  telcove and looking glass in  and broadwing corporation broadwing and the savvis cdn business in january level will continue to evaluate consolidation opportunities and could make additional acquisitions in the future 
the successful integration of these businesses into level is important to the success of level the company must quickly identify synergies  integrate the networks and support organizations  while maintaining the service quality levels expected by customers in order to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions 
successful integration of these acquired businesses will depend on the company s ability to manage these operations  realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by strengthened service offerings and expanded geographic market coverage and  to some degree  to eliminate redundant and excess costs to fully realize the expected synergies 
if the company is not able to efficiently and effectively integrate the acquired businesses or operations  the company may experience material negative consequences to its business  financial condition or results of operations 
level has embarked on a strategy to expand its current metro presence 
the strategy will allow the company to terminate traffic over its owned metro facilities rather than paying third parties to terminate the traffic 
level s ability to provide high speed bandwidth directly to customer facilities is expected to be a competitive advantage as local exchange companies often do not provide this service 
the company intends to offer the traditional set of services in these markets and concentrate its sales efforts on the bandwidth intensive businesses 
the expansion into new metro markets should also provide additional opportunities to sell services on the company s national and international networks 
this new metro strategy includes the acquisitions of progress telecom  icg communications  telcove and looking glass 
as part of its metro strategy and as a result of the acquisition of telcove in the third quarter of and broadwing in the first quarter of  the company is also targeting enterprise customers directly through its newly created business markets group described in more detail below 
with the acquisition of the savvis cdn services business  level embarked on a strategy to expand its content delivery network services 
the company is focusing its attention on growing revenue through core communications services  completing the integration of acquired businesses  developing its metro network strategy and enterprise business  continuing to show improvements in adjusted oibda as a percentage of revenue  and managing cash flows provided by its other communications services and sbc contract services 
the anticipated change in the composition of the company s revenue will require the company to manage operating expenses carefully and concentrate its capital expenditures on those technologies and assets that will enable the company to develop its core communications services further and replace the decline in revenue and earnings from other communications services and sbc contract services 
in the third quarter of  level announced the formation of four customer facing groups to better serve the changing needs of customers in growing markets and drive growth across the organization the wholesale markets group services the communications needs of the largest global service providers  including carriers  cable companies  wireless companies  and voice service providers 
these customers typically integrate level services into their own products and services to offer to their end user customers 
the content markets group focuses on serving media and content companies with large and growing bandwidth needs 
customers in this market include video distribution companies  providers of gaming  mega portals  software service providers  social networking providers  as well as more traditional media distribution companies such as broadcasters  television networks and sports leagues 
the business markets group targets enterprise customers and regional carriers who value a local  professional sales force 
specific customer markets include small  medium  and large businesses  local and regional carriers  state and local government entities  and higher education institutions and consortia 
the european markets group serves the largest european consumers of bandwidth  including the largest european and international carriers  large system integrators  voice service providers  cable operators  internet service providers  content providers  and government and education sectors 
the company believes that the alignment around customer markets should allow it to drive growth while enabling it to better focus on the needs of the customers 
each group will be supported by the dedicated sales  marketing  service management  customer facing operations  and necessary support resources required to execute and increase revenue in these key markets 
in addition to the operational metrics mentioned above  the company is also focusing on improving its liquidity and financial condition and extending the maturity dates of certain debt and lowering the effective interest rate on its outstanding debt over the long term 
in january  the company completed the exchange of several tranches of its debt maturing in for a new tranche of debt maturing in the company was able to extend the maturity date of approximately million of debt due in to in march  level financing issued million of floating rate senior notes due in and million of senior notes due in in april  level financing issued an additional million of the senior notes due in the proceeds from these offerings were used to fund the cash portion of the wiltel and progress telecom acquisitions as well as fund the cost of construction  installation  acquisition  lease  development or improvement of other assets to be used in level s communications business 
in an underwritten public offering in june  level issued million of convertible senior notes due the company also completed the underwritten public offering of million shares of its common stock for which it received million in net proceeds 
level used a portion of these proceeds to redeem selected series of its debt securities maturing in in july  level redeemed all of its senior notes due and senior discount notes due for total consideration of million  excluding accrued interest 
the remaining proceeds were used to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
in june  level financing amended and restated its existing million senior secured credit facility to reduce the interest rate payable under the agreement by basis points  modify the prepayment provisions and make other specified changes 
the company paid approximately million to existing lenders and million to third parties in costs to complete the transaction 
level financing issued million and million of senior notes due in october and december  respectively 
the company received net proceeds of  million after transaction costs from the two issuances 
on december   level financing used a portion of the proceeds to complete a tender offer to repurchase million of senior notes for total consideration of million  excluding accrued interest 
the remaining proceeds were used to fund the cost of construction  installation  acquisition  lease  development or improvement of other assets to be used in level s communications business 
in january  in two separate transactions  the company completed the exchange of million of its convertible senior notes due for a total of million shares of level s common stock 
on february   level announced that it is seeking to refinance level financing s million senior secured term loan 
in addition to increasing the loan amount to up to billion  the company is also seeking  among other things  to reduce the interest rate payable under the agreement and extend the maturity from to the refinancing of the senior secured term loan is expected to close in mid march on february   level financing issued million of its senior notes due and million of its floating rate senior notes due and received net proceeds of million

coal mining level  through its two owned joint venture surface mines in montana and wyoming  sells coal primarily through long term contracts with public utilities 
the long term contracts for the delivery of coal establish the price  volume  and quality requirements of the coal to be delivered 
revenue under these and other contracts is recognized when coal is shipped to the customer 
information services on november   the company sold its wholly owned subsidiary  i structure  llc  which provided computer outsourcing services primarily to small and medium sized businesses 
the company also completed the disposition of its remaining subsidiary in the information services business  software spectrum  inc on september  the results of operations and financial position for i structure and software spectrum are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report 
critical accounting policies the company has identified the policies below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the effect of any associated risks related to these policies on the company s business operations is discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where these policies affect the company s reported and expected financial results 
revenue revenue for communications services  including voice  private line  wavelengths  colocation  internet access  managed modem  data services  video and dark fiber revenue is recognized monthly as the services are provided 
communications services are provided either on a usage basis  which can vary period to period  or at a contractually committed amount 
reciprocal compensation revenue is recognized only when an interconnection agreement is in place with another carrier  or at rates mandated by the fcc 
periodically  the company will receive payment for reciprocal compensation services in excess of fcc rates and before an agreement is in place 
these amounts are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet until a final agreement has been reached and the necessary regulatory approvals have been received at which time the reciprocal compensation revenue is recognized 
these amounts were insignificant to the company in and revenue attributable to leases of dark fiber pursuant to indefeasible rights of use agreements irus that qualify for sales type lease accounting  and were entered into prior to june   was recognized at the time of delivery and acceptance of the fiber by the customer 
certain sale and long term iru agreements of dark fiber and capacity entered into after june   are required to be accounted for in the same manner as sales of real estate with property improvements or integral equipment 
this accounting treatment results in the deferral of revenue for the cash that has been received and the recognition of revenue ratably over the term of the agreement currently up to years 
termination revenue is recognized when a customer disconnects service prior to the end of the contract period  for which level had previously received consideration and for which revenue recognition was deferred 
termination revenue is also recognized when customers make termination penalty payments to level to settle contractually committed purchase amounts that the customer no longer expects to meet or when a customer and level renegotiate a contract under which level is no longer obligated to provide product or services for consideration previously received and for which revenue recognition has been deferred 
termination revenue is reported in the same manner as the original product or service provided 
accounting practice and guidance with respect to the accounting treatment of revenue continues to evolve 
any changes in the accounting treatment could affect the manner in which the company accounts for revenue within its communications and coal businesses 
non cash compensation the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r effective january  sfas no 
r requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of equity or liability instruments issued 
the company adopted the expense recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 in therefore  the effect of applying the change from the original provisions of sfas no 
on the company s financial position or results of operations for the year ended december  was insignificant 
although the recognition of the value of the instruments results in compensation or professional expenses in an entity s financial statements  the expense differs from other compensation and professional expenses in that these charges  though generally permitted to be settled in cash  are typically settled through the issuance of common stock  which would have a dilutive effect upon earnings per share  if and when such options are exercised 
the determination of the estimated fair value used to record the compensation or professional expenses associated with the equity or liability instruments issued requires management to make a number of assumptions and estimates that can change or fluctuate over time 
long lived assets property  plant and equipment is stated at cost  reduced by provisions to recognize economic impairment in value when management determines that events have occurred that require an analysis of potential impairment 
costs associated directly with network expansions and the development of business support systems  primarily employee related costs are capitalized 
the company capitalized million  million and million of cost  primarily direct labor and related employee benefits  in  and  respectively 
intercity network segments  gateway facilities  local networks and operating equipment that have been placed in service are being depreciated over their estimated useful lives  primarily ranging from years 
the total cost of a business support system is amortized over a useful life of three years 
the useful lives of the company s assets are estimates and actual in service periods for specific assets could differ significantly from these estimates 
due to changes in technology and the competitive environment  these estimates require a significant amount of judgment 
management monitors and evaluates these estimates on an annual basis or as circumstances change that may indicate a change in estimate is required 
during the company extended the total useful lives of its existing fiber assets from seven to years  its existing transmission equipment from five to seven years and its existing ip equipment from three to four years 
the company at least annually  or as events or circumstances change that could affect the recoverability of the carrying value of its long lived assets  conducts a comprehensive review of the carrying value of its assets to determine if the carrying amount of the assets are recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this review requires the identification of the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of grouping assets subject to review 
the estimate of undiscounted cash flows includes long term forecasts of revenue growth  gross margins and capital expenditures 
all of these items require significant judgment and assumptions 
an impairment loss may exist when the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying amount 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  the amount of the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset s carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value  based on management s assumptions and projections 
the company assessed its communications long lived assets for impairment at december   and determined that an impairment charge was not required 
the communications network includes network equipment  fiber  multiple conduits  customer premise equipment and colocation facilities 
historically  level has evaluated colocation facilities  certain additional conduits and its communications network assets as separate asset groupings 
beginning in  the company stopped evaluating colocation assets separately and began including them in the communications network asset group due to changes in the nature of the cash flows from the delivery of colocation services 
the majority of the company s colocation customers now purchase other services in conjunction with their colocation services thereby reducing the independence of colocation services cash flows from other services 
in addition  the percentage of colocation space used to support the communications network asset has increased over time 
the impairment analysis is based on a long term cash flow forecast to assess the recovery of the communications assets over their estimated useful lives 
level also assesses the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 

the carrying value of goodwill is compared to its fair value 
if the fair value does not exceed the carrying value of the goodwill  an analysis is performed to determine if an impairment charge should be recorded 
the company also evaluates intangible assets with indefinite lives individually on an annual basis  or as events or circumstances change that could affect the recoverability of the carrying value of the asset  in accordance with sfas no 
the company did not record charges for the impairment of long lived assets or goodwill in  or management s estimate of the future cash flows attributable to its long lived assets and the fair value of its businesses involve significant uncertainty 
those estimates are based on management s assumptions of future results  growth trends and industry conditions 
the impairment analysis of long lived assets also requires management to make certain subjective assumptions and estimates regarding the expected future use of certain additional conduits evaluated for impairment separately from the network asset group 
management will continue to assess the company s assets for impairment as events occur or as industry conditions warrant 
given the significant uncertainty  judgment and assumptions involved in developing the estimates of future cash flows and the number of years of remaining useful life of certain of the company s assets  it is possible that the company may determine that an impairment charge is required in the future due to changes in these assumptions and estimates 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the most critical estimates and assumptions are made in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts  revenue reserves  recovery of long lived assets  useful lives of long lived assets  accruals for estimated tax and legal liabilities  cost of revenue disputes for communications services  unfavorable contracts recognized in purchase accounting and asset retirement obligations 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions

eitf  accounting for registration payment arrangements fsp eitf 
fsp eitf addresses an issuer s accounting for registration payment arrangements 
fsp eitf specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement  whether issued as a separate agreement or included as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement  should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

a registration payment arrangement is defined as an arrangement that specifies that the issuer will endeavor to file a registration statement for the resale of specified financial instruments and or for the resale of equity shares that are issuable upon exercise or conversion of specified financial instruments and for that registration statement to be declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
the arrangement requires the issuer to transfer consideration to the counterparty if the registration statement for the resale of the financial instrument or instruments subject to the arrangement is not declared effective or if effectiveness of the registration statement is not maintained 
fsp eitf specifies that if the transfer of consideration under a registration payment arrangement is probable and can be reasonably estimated at inception  the contingent liability under the registration payment arrangement shall be included in the allocation of proceeds from the related financing transaction using the measurement guidance in sfas no

revenue attributable to these service groupings is provided in the following table dollars in millions core communications services transport and infrastructure wholesale ip and data voice vyvx other communication services managed modem reciprocal compensation managed ip dsl aggregation sbc contract services total communications revenue the company s core communications services revenue increased in compared to the growth in the company s existing services as well as the acquisitions of wiltel  progress telecom  icg communications  telcove and looking glass contributed to the increase 
during  the company recorded revenue from the date of acquisition attributable to progress telecom of million  icg communications of million  telcove of million and looking glass of million 
during  the company integrated a significant portion of wiltel into the business 
as a result  separate revenue information for former wiltel customers is no longer available other than for sbc contract services 
transport and infrastructure revenue increased in primarily due to the acquisitions of wiltel  progress telecom  icg communications  telcove and looking glass 
in addition  increased demand for complex nationwide solutions and colocation capacity in large markets contributed to the revenue growth in termination revenue related to transport and infrastructure services decreased approximately million from million in to million in the termination revenue in was primarily attributable to the termination of dark fiber lease agreements with two customers 
wholesale ip and data revenue increased in primarily due to customers obtained in the acquisitions of wiltel  progress telecom  icg communications  telcove and looking glass 
wholesale ip and data revenue also increased due to traffic growth in north america from new and existing customers that exceeded the approximately rate of price compression in traffic growth was mitigated by one customer s migration of traffic to its own network which was acquired via a merger with another carrier 
improved market acceptance of the company s vpn service and the continued growth of previously awarded contracts also contributed to the increase in wholesale ip and data revenue 
wholesale ip and data revenue includes million of termination revenue in level s voice revenue increased in the increase is primarily attributable to the operations acquired in the wiltel  telcove and icg communications acquisitions  particularly domestic and international voice termination services  and growth in level s existing wholesale and voip related services including voice termination  local inbound  enhanced local and toll free services 
on a combined basis  voice services experienced a increase in minutes of use in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in vyvx revenue increased to million in as a result of including a full year of vyvx revenue in the company s results

the company is not able to estimate the specific value of these types of transactions until they occur  but does not currently expect to recognize significant termination revenue for the foreseeable future 
the company expects core communications services revenue to increase in as a result of the progress telecom  icg communications  telcove and looking glass acquisitions completed in  the broadwing and savvis cdn business acquisitions completed in january and expected increases in demand for the company s core communications services 
managed modem revenue declined in as a result of the continued migration from narrow band dial up services to higher speed broadband services by end user customers 
this change has resulted in a decline in the demand for managed modem ports 
america online  the company s largest managed modem customer  continued to reduce the number of ports it purchases from level in in addition to the port cancellation provisions  the contracts with america online contain market pricing provisions that have the effect of lowering revenue as level is obligated to provide america online a reduced per port rate if level offers another customer better pricing for a lower volume of comparable services 
managed modem revenue also declined in as a result of certain contracts being renewed or renegotiated at prices lower than were in effect in the declines in managed modem revenue have been partially offset by increases in market share as a result of certain competitors exiting segments of the managed modem business in the second half of the company expects managed modem revenue to continue to decline in the future primarily due to an increase in the number of subscribers migrating to broadband services and the potential pricing concessions as contracts are renewed 
the company did not recognize dsl aggregation revenue in due to the fact that the company s primary dsl aggregation customer completed the migration of its dsl subscribers to its own network in the third quarter of in addition  the company s other dsl contracts expired in and were not renewed

by the end of  up to of its total reciprocal compensation revenue is expected to be earned from voice services which is included in core communications services revenue 
to the extent that the company is unable to sign new interconnection agreements or signs new agreements containing lower rates  or there is a significant decline in the company s managed modem dial up business  or fcc or state regulations change such that carriers are not required to compensate other carriers for terminating isp bound traffic  reciprocal compensation revenue may decline significantly over time 
the company s legacy managed ip business consists primarily of a business that was acquired in the genuity transaction in the company has not invested in this service and is not actively looking for new customers 
the decline in revenue is attributable to the disconnection of service by existing customers 
the company expects this trend to continue in sbc contract services revenue increased significantly in as a result of including a full year of sbc contract services revenue in the company s results 
the sbc contract services agreement was obtained in december as part of the wiltel acquisition 
under the terms of the agreement  sbc has gross margin purchase commitments through as of december   the remaining minimum gross margin commitment under the agreement to be utilized during was approximately million  and million from january through the end of additionally  the sbc contract services provides for the payment of million if certain performance criteria are met by level level is eligible to earn million in and of the annual amount  is based on monthly performance and the remaining is based on performance criteria for the full year

the increase in cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue  is primarily attributable to the recognition of termination revenue in  with no corresponding cost of revenue  and the significant voice and sbc contract services revenue obtained in the wiltel acquisition 
the margins for the voice and sbc contract services revenue are lower than the margins earned on other components included in core and other communications services revenue
