gross margin gross margin was in  compared with in and in margins increased in due to increased sales volume 
partially offset by reduced product pricing 
margins decreased from to due to higher steel costs  higher freight costs 
and higher warranty provisions from product mix  partially offset by higher selling prices 
the price of steel  a major component of our products  has fluctuated since the negative impact on gross margins from changes in steel prices in was minimal compared to the corresponding period of we are uncertain of the likely impact of steel prices on margins for selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  including bad debt expense  increased by  or  in to  compared to an increase of  or  in as a percentage of net sales  these expenses were  and in  and  respectively

based on this reevaluation  we reduced the valuation allowance by  effective july  during the period from the establishment of the valuation allowance in  to the july  reduction of the valuation allowance  our income tax provision was limited to state taxes and federal alternative minimum taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of approximately of income before taxes for the third and fourth quarters of and we anticipate an income tax provision at a similar effective tax rate in future periods 
actual cash outlays for taxes will  however  continue to be reduced by the available operating loss carryforwards  consistent with prior periods 
as of december   us federal operating loss carryforwards of approximately  were available to us to offset future taxable income and  as of such date  we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of  federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of  and federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of  the net deferred tax asset balance of  at december  represents the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized  and the remaining valuation allowance at december  is  we will continue to assess the need for the remaining valuation allowance in future periods

in accordance with the terms of the preferred stock  all accrued dividends on the preferred stock  in the amount of  were paid at the time of conversion in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of  compared to  at december  the increase in working capital is primarily due to the reduction of the deferred tax valuation allowance resulting in a current deferred tax asset of  a  increase in accounts receivable  reflecting higher sales volume in the fourth quarter of versus the fourth quarter of  and a  increase in prepaid expenses

in june  the underwriters in this offering exercised a portion of their over allotment option and purchased an additional  shares of common stock  of which  shares were sold by a selling stockholder 
we received net cash proceeds in this offering  after commissions and offering expenses  of approximately  net proceeds were used to repay our total indebtedness then outstanding under our credit facilities 
we did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling stockholders 
in august  we entered into an industrial building lease build to suit triple net the lease pursuant to which an approximate  square feet manufacturing  office and warehouse facility in owatonna  minnesota the owatonna premises is being constructed to our specifications 
simultaneously with entering into the lease  we exercised our option under the lease to acquire the owatonna premises for a purchase price of  subject to adjustment 
the closing of the purchase and sale of the owatonna premises is subject to standard conditions and will occur upon substantial completion of the improvements  scheduled for june  subject to extension 
the lease of our existing owatonna facility will terminate in conjunction with the relocation to this new facility 
in october  we entered into a loan agreement the citizens loan agreement with citizens bank of massachusetts citizens  pursuant to which citizens has agreed to advance to us up to a  mortgage loan to finance the acquisition of the owatonna premises 
this loan  which is subject to standard conditions  will be advanced simultaneously with our acquisition of the owatonna premises  currently scheduled for june the citizen s mortgage loan will be secured by a lien on the owatonna premises 
in august  we sold our owatonna  minnesota manufacturing  warehouse and office facility and entered into a lease of the owatonna facility 
the lease contains renewal options as well as options to terminate the lease if we elect to relocate 
due to an option to repurchase the facility originally contained in the lease  the transaction was treated for financial accounting purposes as a financing transaction whereby payments made of  through december were recorded as interest expense 
on december   the lease was amended to eliminate our option to repurchase the building in exchange for certain services to be provided by the landlord 
accordingly  the transaction has been accounted for as a sale leaseback subsequent to december   resulting in a deferred gain of  at december   of which  was included in accrued expenses and  was included in other long term liabilities and is being amortized over months 
at december    of the deferred gain was included in accrued expenses

we have also posted a letter of credit of  in connection with our appeal of the judgment in colassi v 
cybex international  inc no payments will be required by us with respect to the colassi judgment until the end of the appeal process 
we rely upon cash flows from our operations and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
a decline in sales or margins or a failure to remain in compliance with the terms of our credit facilities could result in having insufficient funds for such purposes 
we believe that our cash flows and the availability under our credit facilities are sufficient to fund our general working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
as of december   we had approximately  in net operating loss carryforwards  substantially all of which will be available to offset taxable income

these leases are accounted for as sales type leases and are generally for terms of three to five years  at which time title transfers to the lessee 
while most of these financings are without recourse  in certain cases we may offer a guaranty or other recourse provisions 
at december   the maximum contingent liability under all recourse provisions was approximately  a reserve for estimated losses under recourse provisions of  has been recorded based upon historical and industry experience  and is included in accrued liabilities at december  new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a threshold of more likely than not for recognition of tax benefits of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides related guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  and disclosure 
the provisions of fin are effective for the company on january   with any cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening accumulated deficit 
we are in the process of assessing the impact of adopting fin on our results of operations and financial position 
based on the analysis completed to date  management does not expect fin to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and disclosures 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  realizability of inventory  reserves for warranty obligations  reserves for legal matters and product liability  recoverability of goodwill and valuation of deferred tax assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which could materially impact the company s results of operations and financial position 
these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit information 
management continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains a reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
if the financial condition of a specific customer or the company s general customer base were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
realizability of inventory 
the company values inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and historical usage  after considering the impact of new products 
if actual market conditions and product demand are less favorable than projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
warranty reserve 
all products are warranted for up to three years for labor and up to ten years for structural frames 
warranty periods for parts range from one to ten years depending on the part and the type of equipment 
a warranty liability is recorded at the time of product sale based on estimates that are developed from historical information and certain assumptions about future events 
future warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  usage and service costs incurred in addressing warranty claims 
these factors are impacted by the level of new product introductions and the mix of equipment sold to the commercial and consumer markets 
if actual warranty costs differ from management s estimates  adjustments to the warranty liability would be required 
legal matters 
the company has recorded a reserve related to certain legal matters for which it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be determined 
with respect to other matters  management has concluded that a loss is only possible or remote and  therefore  no loss is recorded 
as additional information becomes available  the company will continue to assess whether losses from legal matters are probable  possible or remote  as well as the adequacy of accruals for probable loss contingencies 
product liability reserve 
due to the nature of its products  the company is involved in certain pending product liability claims and lawsuits 
the company maintains product liability insurance coverage subject to deductibles 
reserves for self insured retention  including claims incurred but not yet reported  are included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  based on management s review of outstanding claims and claims history and consultation with its third party claims administrators 
if actual results vary from management s estimates  adjustments to the reserve would be required 
recoverability of goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  management is required to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine whether the fair value of the business supports the carrying value of goodwill and net operating assets 
this analysis includes assumptions and estimates about future sales  costs  working capital  capital expenditures and cost of capital 
if these assumptions and estimates change in the future  the company may be required to record an impairment charge related to goodwill 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
in  we established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
effective july   we reevaluated the need for this valuation allowance in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  due to the existence of various factors 
based on this reevaluation  we reduced the valuation allowance by  effective july  the net deferred tax asset balance of  at december  represents the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized and the remaining valuation allowance at december  is  we will continue to assess the need for the remaining valuation allowance in future periods 
approximately  of income before income taxes is needed to fully realize the company s recorded net deferred tax asset and  of future taxable income is needed to fully realize the company s deferred tax assets 
if the estimates and related assumptions relating to the likely utilization of the deferred tax asset change in the future  the valuation allowance may change accordingly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company s debt portfolio as of december  is comprised of variable rate debt denominated in us dollars 
changes in interest rates have an impact on the variable portion of the company s debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the company s consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the company had variable rate debt with a carrying value of  a basis point change in interest rates would have impacted interest expense by  for the year ended december  the company has an interest rate swap which effectively converts the rate on a  mortgage  to be incurred in connection with the purchase of a building in  from a floating rate to a fixed rate throughout the duration of the loan 
the change in the fair value of the interest swap is included as a component of interest expense 
the fair value of the interest rate swap is  at december   and is included in other liabilities
