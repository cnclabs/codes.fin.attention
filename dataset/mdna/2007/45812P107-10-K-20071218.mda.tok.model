item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company background on january   we announced our intention to acquire icsi 
icsi was a public company in taiwan and traded on the gre tai securities market otc 
icsi is a fabless semiconductor company whose principal products are dram and controller chips 
prior to this transaction  we owned approximately of icsi 
in the nine months ended september   we purchased additional shares of icsi in the open market for approximately million increasing our ownership percentage to approximately at september  in fiscal  we purchased additional shares of icsi for approximately million increasing our ownership percentage to approximately at september  in fiscal  we purchased additional shares of icsi for approximately million and our ownership percentage was approximately at september  our financial results for fiscal  fiscal and for fiscal beginning may  reflect accounting for icsi on a consolidated basis 
on may   we assumed effective control of icsi and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we began consolidating the financial results of icsi with our results as of such date 
our financial results for fiscal through the period ended april  reflect accounting for icsi on the equity basis and include our percentage share of the results of icsi s operations 
in february  we sold approximately of our shares in signia technologies inc signia  a developer of wireless semiconductors  thereby reducing our ownership percentage to approximately 
effective march   we resumed accounting for signia on the cost basis 
during the period from december  through february   our financial results reflect accounting for signia on a consolidated basis 
our financial results through the period ended november  reflect accounting for signia on the cost basis 
at september   we owned approximately of signia 
in december  we sold our remaining investment in key stream corp 
ksc  a semiconductor company 
our financial results for fiscal  until our sale  for fiscal and for fiscal beginning may  reflect accounting for ksc on the equity basis 
overview we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs and markets high performance integrated circuits for the following key markets i digital consumer electronics  ii networking  iii mobile communications and iv automotive electronics 
our primary products are high speed and low power sram and low and medium density dram 
we also design and market eeproms  smartcards  and selected non memory products focused on our key markets 
we were founded in october and initially focused on high performance  low cost sram for pc cache memory applications 
in  we introduced our first low and medium density dram products 
prior to fiscal  our sram product family generated a majority of our revenue 
however  sales of our low and medium density dram products have represented a majority of our net sales in each year since fiscal in order to limit and control our operating expenses  in recent years we reduced our headcount in the us and transferred various functions to taiwan and china 
our acquisition of icsi was a key part of this strategy 
we believe this strategy has enabled us to limit our operating expenses while simultaneously locating these functions closer to our manufacturing partners and our customers 
as a result of these efforts  we currently have significantly more employees in asia than we do in the us we intend to continue these strategies going forward 
as a fabless semiconductor company  our business model is less capital intensive because we rely on third parties to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
because of our dependence on third party wafer 
table of contents foundries  our ability to increase our unit sales volumes depends on our ability to increase our wafer capacity allocation from current foundries  add additional foundries and improve yields of good die per wafer 
the average selling prices of our sram and dram products are very sensitive to supply and demand conditions in our target markets and have generally declined over time 
we experienced declines in the average selling prices for many of our products in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we expect average selling prices for our products to decline in the future  principally due to increased market competition and an increased supply of competitive products in the market 
any future decreases in our average selling prices could have an adverse impact on our revenue growth rate  gross margins and operating margins 
our ability to maintain or increase revenues will be highly dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in average selling prices of existing products 
declining average selling prices will adversely affect our gross margins unless we are able to offset such declines with commensurate reductions in per unit costs or changes in product mix in favor of higher margin products 
revenue from product sales to our direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
a portion of our sales is made to distributors under agreements that provide the possibility of certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges 
given the uncertainties associated with credits that will be issued to these distributors  we defer recognition of such sales until our products are sold by the distributors to their end customers 
revenue from sales to distributors who do not have sales price rebates or product return privileges is recognized at the time our products are sold by us to the distributors 
we market and sell our products in asia  the us and europe and other locations through our direct sales force  distributors and sales representatives 
the percentage of our sales shipped outside the us was approximately  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
we measure sales location by the shipping destination  even if the customer is headquartered in the us we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to represent a significant percentage of our net sales 
the percentages of our net sales by region are set forth in the following table fiscal years ended september  asia europe us other total our sales are generally made by purchase orders 
because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice  backlog is not a good indicator of our future sales 
cancellations of customer orders or changes in product specifications could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 
since a significant portion of our revenue is from the digital consumer electronics market  our business may be subject to seasonality  with increased revenues in the third and fourth calendar quarters of each year  when customers place orders to meet year end holiday demand 
however  broad fluctuations in our overall business in the past several years makes it difficult for us to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including economic conditions in asia  particularly taiwan and china  changes in trade policy and regulatory requirements  duties  tariffs and other trade 
table of contents barriers and restrictions  the burdens of complying with foreign laws and  possibly  political instability 
all of our foundries and assembly and test subcontractors are located in asia 
although our international sales are largely denominated in us dollars  we do have sales transactions in new taiwan dollars  in hong kong dollars and in chinese renminbi 
in addition  we have foreign operations where expenses are generally denominated in the local currency 
such transactions expose us to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
we monitor our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  but have not adopted any hedging strategies to date 
there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business and operating results in the future 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales consist principally of total product sales less estimated sales returns 
net sales increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net sales of million can be attributed primarily to higher sales of our application specific standard products assp which includes our eeprom  smart card and logic products as well as our sram products 
an increase in unit shipments of our sram products in fiscal compared to fiscal more than offset a decline in average selling prices for such products resulting in an overall increase in sram revenue 
sales of assp products also increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  but such products accounted for only about of our total sales in fiscal in addition  an increase in unit shipments of our dram products  specifically our mb and mb dram products  in fiscal compared to fiscal more than offset a decrease in average selling prices resulting in an overall increase in dram revenue 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our existing products will generally decline over time  although the rate of decline may fluctuate for certain products 
there can be no assurance that any future price declines will be offset by higher volumes or by higher prices on newer products 
in fiscal and fiscal  no single customer accounted for over of our net sales 
gross profit 
cost of sales includes die cost from the wafers acquired from foundries  subcontracted package  assembly and test costs  costs associated with in house product testing  quality assurance and import duties 
gross profit increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal our gross profit for fiscal included inventory write downs of million compared to million of inventory write downs in fiscal the inventory write downs were for excess and obsolescence issues and lower of cost or market accounting on certain of our products 
our gross profit for fiscal and fiscal  benefited from the sale of million and million  respectively  of previously written down products 
the increase in gross profit in fiscal compared to fiscal can be attributed to increased unit shipments of our sram and assp products which more than offset declines in average selling prices for such products 
in addition  declines in the cost of our sram products more than offset declines in the average selling prices of our sram products in fiscal this contributed to an increase in our sram gross margin 
our dram gross margin increased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of a shift in product mix to higher density higher margin products 
we believe that the average selling prices of our products will decline over time and  unless we are able to reduce our cost per unit to the extent necessary to offset such declines  the decline in average selling prices will result in a material decline in our gross margin 
in addition  product costs could increase if our suppliers raise prices  which could result in a material decline in our gross margin 
in the past  foundries have raised wafer prices when demand for end products increases 
although we have product cost reduction programs in place that involve efforts to reduce internal costs and supplier costs  there can be no assurance that product costs will be reduced or that such reductions will be sufficient to offset the expected declines in average selling prices 
we do not believe that such cost reduction efforts are likely to have a material adverse impact on the quality of our products or the level of service provided by us 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in research and development expenses 
table of contents can be attributed to a decrease in maskwork expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal and a decrease in expenses for our bluetooth and flash controller development projects which we exited in the march quarter 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in development costs for new dram and sram products as well as an increase in costs of associated with the development for products for automotive and industrial applications 
our research and development expenses could increase in absolute dollars in future periods due to increased costs associated with the development of new products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was mainly attributable to approximately million in legal expenses and accounting fees in fiscal attributable to our stock option backdating investigation and shareholder derivative lawsuits compared to approximately million of such expenses in fiscal in addition  there was an increase in selling commissions associated with higher revenues in fiscal compared fiscal acquired in process technology charge 
in fiscal  we incurred a million acquired in process technology charge ipr d in connection with our purchase of additional shares of icsi 
the million allocated to ipr d was expensed in fiscal as it was deemed to have no future alternative use 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the million of interest and other income expense  net in fiscal is comprised primarily of interest income of million  a million gain in connection with the settlement of a commercial dispute  million in rental income from the lease of excess space in our taiwan facility and million expense estimated for the settlement of derivative lawsuits 
the million of interest and other income expense  net in fiscal is comprised primarily of interest income of million  million in foreign currency exchange gains  million in rental income from the lease of excess space in our taiwan facility  and million from the sale of assets from our bluetooth business offset by an impairment charge of approximately million related to our investment in signia 
gain on sale of investments 
the gain on the sale of investments was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  we sold shares of ralink a cost method equity investment for approximately million and recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in addition  in fiscal  we sold approximately million shares of smic for approximately million which resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
we also sold our remaining shares of ksc for approximately million which resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in fiscal  we sold our shares in e cmos for approximately million which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
in addition  we sold approximately of our shares in signia for approximately million which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
in addition  in september  we sold a cost method equity investment for approximately million resulting in a gain of approximately provision benefit for income taxes 
for fiscal  we recorded an income tax provision of  consisting of federal and state minimum taxes and foreign withholding taxes net of the reversal of previously provided taxes 
for fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of  consisting of the reversal of previously provided taxes that are no longer necessary offset by foreign withholding tax  taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions and state minimum taxes 
we have a recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to our operating loss history and our expectation of future taxable income 
we review the realization of these deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
any release of the valuation allowance would have a favorable impact on the provision for income taxes within our statement of operations 
minority interest in net income loss of consolidated subsidiaries 
the minority interest in net income loss of consolidated subsidiaries was income of million in fiscal compared to a loss of million in

net sales increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net sales of million can principally be attributed to our acquisition of a controlling interest in and the resulting consolidation of icsi s results of operations beginning in may an increase in unit shipments of our sram products in fiscal compared to fiscal more than offset a decline in average selling prices for such products resulting in an overall increase in sram revenue 
in addition  an increase in unit shipments of our dram products  specifically our mb  mb and mb dram products  in fiscal compared to fiscal more than offset a decrease in average selling prices for such products resulting in an overall increase in dram revenue

the increase in gross profit in fiscal can be attributed to increased unit shipments of dram and sram products due to our acquisition of icsi which more than offset declines in average selling prices for such products 
also  we recognized million of gross profit on inventory sold during fiscal that had been previously written off 
the increase in the gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal can be primarily attributed to declines in the cost of our dram products which more than offset declines in the average selling prices of our dram products 
this contributed to an increase in our dram gross margin 
however  declines in the average selling prices of our sram products more than offset declines in the cost of our sram products in fiscal compared to fiscal resulting in a decline in our sram gross margin

we have million available through a number of short term lines of credit with various financial institutions in taiwan 
these lines of credit expire at various times through august as of september   we had outstanding borrowings of approximately million under these short term lines of credit 
our unused short term lines of credit amounted to approximately million at september  
table of contents in november  we entered into a lease for approximately  square feet of office space in san jose and relocated our headquarters there in february the lease on this building expires in june outside of the us  we have operations in leased sites in china and hong kong 
in addition to these sites  we lease sales offices in the us  europe and asia 
these leases expire at various dates through in taiwan  we own and occupy the icsi building 
the land upon which the icsi building is situated is leased under an operating lease that expires in march our outstanding commitments under these leases were approximately million at september  we generally warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of months 
liability for a stated warranty period is usually limited to the replacement of defective items or return of amounts paid 
warranty expense has historically been immaterial to our financial statements 
our contractual cash obligations at september  are outlined in the table below payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases purchase obligations with wafer foundries non cancelable purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations on november   we announced that our board of directors had approved the repurchase of up to million of shares of our common stock 
we intend to use million of this amount to repurchase up to million of our common stock through a self tender offer at a price of per share 
the offer commenced on december  and is expected to close in early january we believe our existing funds will satisfy our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements through at least the next months 
we may from time to time take actions to further increase our cash position through equity or debt financings  sales of shares of investments  bank borrowings  or the disposition of certain assets 
from time to time  we may also commit to acquisitions or equity investments  including strategic investments in wafer fabrication foundries or assembly and test subcontractors 
to the extent we enter into such transactions  any such transaction could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing to fund such activities 
there can be no assurance that any such additional financing could be obtained on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements as of september   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make difficult and subjective estimates  judgments and assumptions 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience combined with knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future  considering the information available at the time 
actual results could differ from those 
table of contents estimates and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we reevaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
our critical accounting policies which are impacted by our estimates are i the valuation of our inventory  which impacts cost of goods sold and gross profit  ii the valuation of our allowance for sales returns and allowances  which impacts net sales  iii the valuation of our allowance for doubtful accounts  which impacts general and administrative expense  iv accounting for acquisitions and goodwill  which impacts other expense when we record impairments  v the valuation of our non marketable equity securities  which impacts other expense when we record impairments and vi accounting for stock based compensation which impacts costs of goods sold  research and development expense and selling  general and administrative expense 
each of these policies is described in more detail below 
we also have other key accounting policies that may not require us to make estimates and judgments that are as subjective or difficult 
for instance  our policies with regard to revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues on sales to distributors with sales price rebates and product return privileges 
these policies are described in the notes to our financial statements contained elsewhere in this report on form k 
valuation of inventory 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
determining market value requires us to project unit prices and volumes for future periods in which we expect to sell inventory on hand as of the balance sheet date 
as a result of these estimates  we may record a charge to cost of goods sold  which decreases our gross profit  in advance of when the inventory is actually sold to reflect market values  net of sales commission costs  that are below our manufacturing costs 
conversely  if we sell inventory that has previously been written down to the lower of cost or market at more favorable prices than we had forecasted at the time of the write down  our gross profit may be higher 
in addition to lower of cost or market write downs  we also analyze inventory to determine whether any of it is excess  obsolete or defective 
we write down to zero dollars which is a charge to cost of goods sold the carrying value of inventory on hand that has aged over one year to cover estimated excess and obsolete exposures  unless adjustments are made based on our judgments for newer products  end of life products  planned inventory increases or strategic customer supply 
in making such judgments to write down inventory  we take into account the product life cycles which can range from six to months  the stage in the life cycle of the product  and the impact of competitors announcements and product introductions on our products 
once established  these adjustments are considered permanent 
valuation of allowance for sales returns and allowances 
net sales consist principally of total product sales less estimated sales returns 
to estimate sales returns and allowances  we analyze potential customer specific product application issues  potential quality and reliability issues and historical returns 
we evaluate quarterly the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns and allowances 
this allowance is reflected as a reduction to accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
increases to the allowance are recorded as a reduction to net sales 
because the allowance for sales returns and allowances is based on our judgments and estimates  particularly as to product application  quality and reliability issues  our allowances may not be adequate to cover actual sales returns and other allowances 
if our allowances are not adequate  our net sales could be adversely affected 
valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments for goods and services purchased from us 
we make our estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
once an account is deemed unlikely to be fully collected  we write down the carrying value of the receivable to the estimated recoverable value  which results in a charge to general and administrative expense  which decreases our profitability 
accounting for acquisitions and goodwill 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase accounting method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
under this method  the total consideration paid  excluding  if any  the contingent consideration that has not been earned  is allocated over the fair value of the net assets acquired  including in process research 
table of contents and development  with any excess allocated to goodwill 
goodwill is defined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value allocated to the net assets 
our judgments as to fair value of the assets will  therefore  affect the amount of goodwill that we record 
management is responsible for the valuation of tangible and intangible assets 
for tangible assets acquired in any acquisition  such as plant and equipment  the useful lives are estimated by considering comparable lives of similar assets  past history  the intended use of the assets and their condition 
in estimating the useful life of the acquired intangible assets with definite lives  we consider the industry environment and unique factors relating to each product relative to our business strategy and the likelihood of technological obsolescence 
acquired intangible assets primarily include core and current technology  customer relationships and customer contracts 
we are currently amortizing our acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods generally ranging from six months to six years 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances where indicators of impairment may exist 
for instance  in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of tangible and intangible assets  including goodwill 
in fiscal  we recorded charges for impairment of goodwill in the amount of million 
valuation of non marketable securities 
our ability to recover our strategic investments in equity securities that are non marketable and to earn a return on these investments is largely dependent on financial market conditions and the occurrence of liquidity events  such as initial public offerings  mergers or acquisitions  and private equity transactions 
the timing of when any of these events may occur is uncertain and very difficult to predict 
in addition  under our accounting policy  we are required to periodically review all of our investments for impairment 
in the case of non marketable equity securities  this requires significant judgment on our part  including an assessment of the investees financial condition  the existence of subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant equity preferences  as well as the investees historical results of operations and projected results and cash flows 
if the actual outcomes for the investees are significantly different from their forecasts  the carrying value of our non marketable equity securities may be above fair value  and we may incur additional charges in future periods  which will decrease our profitability 
in fiscal  we recorded an impairment loss of approximately million related to one of our non marketable equity securities 
in fiscal  we recorded approximately million impairment losses related to two of our non marketable equity securities 
at september   our strategic investments in non marketable securities totaled million 
accounting for stock based compensation 
effective october   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated results for prior periods 
under sfas r  stock option costs is calculated on the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model 
the compensation cost is then recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the option  which is generally the option vesting term of four years 
we use the black scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant 
the black scholes valuation model requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected term  volatility  dividend yield and risk free interest rates that determine the stock option fair value 
in addition  sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant 
in subsequent periods  if actual forfeitures differ from the estimate  the forfeiture rate may be revised 
we estimate our expected forfeitures rate based on our historical activity and judgment regarding trends 
based upon the securities and exchange commission sec issuance of staff accounting bulletin no 
sab regarding the sec s interpretation of sfas r  we use the simplified calculation of expected life 
if we determined that another method used to estimate expected life was more reasonable than our current method  or if another method for calculating these inputs assumptions was prescribed by authoritative guidance  the fair value calculated could change materially 

table of contents impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the provisions are effective us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial market risk includes foreign currency transactions  exposure to changes in interest rates on our fixed rate debt  our investments in marketable equity securities and our investments in private companies 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our consolidated revenue 
our international sales are largely denominated in us dollars and therefore are not subject to material foreign currency exchange risk 
however  we have operations in china  europe  taiwan  hong kong  india  japan  korea and singapore where our expenses are denominated in each country s local currency and are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
in fiscal and in fiscal  we recorded exchange gains of approximately million and million  respectively 
however  in fiscal  we recorded exchange losses of approximately million 
while in recent periods  we have not experienced any significant negative impact on our operations as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  we could be negatively impacted by exchange rate fluctuations in the future 
we do not currently engage in any hedging activities 
we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at september  excluding million of smic stock included in short term investments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without increasing risk 
we invest primarily in high quality  short term debt instruments such as municipal auction rate certificates and instruments issued by high quality financial institutions and companies  including money market instruments 
a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease in our interest income 
as our portfolio consists mainly of short term investments whose interest rates reset  a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates would not have a material affect on the value of our investments 
we own ordinary shares in smic which has been a publicly traded company since march smic s ordinary shares are traded on the hong kong stock exchange and smic american depository receipts adr are traded on the new york stock exchange 
each smic adr represents fifty ordinary shares 
we use the weighted average cost method to determine the cost basis of shares of smic 
in fiscal  we sold shares of smic and recorded gross proceeds of approximately million and a pre tax gain of approximately million 
since smic s ipo  we account for our shares in smic under the provisions of fasb and mark the shares to the market value with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the cost basis of our shares in smic is approximately million and the market value at september  was approximately million 
the cost basis of our shares in smic is approximately million and the market value at december  was approximately million 
the market value of smic shares is subject to fluctuations and our carrying value will be subject to adjustments to reflect changes in smic s market value in future periods 
in the event the market value of our smic shares declines below our cost basis  and the decline is other than temporary  we may be required to recognize a loss on our investment through operating results 
we have investments in equity securities of privately held companies of approximately million at september  these investments are generally in companies in the semiconductor industry 
these investments are included in other assets and are accounted for using the equity or cost method 
for investments in which no public market exists  our policy is to review the operating performance  recent financing transactions and cash flow forecasts for such companies in assessing whether our investments in these companies are impaired below our cost basis 
impairment losses on equity investments are recorded when events and circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired and the decline in value is other than temporary 
in this regard  we recorded approximately a million impairment loss on one of our equity positions in fiscal
