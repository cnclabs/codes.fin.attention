overview we are a leader in the design and manufacture of customer specific mixed signal semiconductor products 
we focus on the automotive  medical  industrial  communications and military and aerospace markets where there is a significant need for electronic products to interact with the real world through analog signals  such as light  heat  pressure  power and radio waves 
these analog signals are captured  processed  controlled and converted into digital signals by mixed signal semiconductors provided by us 
our integrated mixed signal products combine analog and digital circuitry on a single integrated circuit  or ic  to perform functions that range from monitoring of human heart rates to determining air pressure in a tire 
we provide complete solutions to our customers through both custom and application specific standard products and manufacturing services 
among our core technical capabilities are our ability to integrate computing  accurate sensing and high voltage control capabilities in semiconductors that can operate in rugged high voltage or high temperature environments  our low power digital signal processors and our market leading structured digital conversion platforms for field programmable gate arrays  or fpgas  to application specific integrated circuits conversions 
we work closely with most of our customers and we have been supplying many of our customers for over ten years 
our current customers include industry leaders such as alcatel  general electric  hella  hewlett packard  medtronic and siemens 
we believe we are the sole source provider for the majority of our integrated mixed signal products and due to the nature of our products and the markets we serve  we estimate our average product life to be eight to ten years 
we have been leveraging our end market expertise and intellectual property to increase the share of our revenue that is derived from application specific standard products in order to broaden our offering to customers and to improve returns on our research and development investment 
when evaluating our business  we generally look at financial measures  such as revenue  gross margins and operating margins 
we also use internal tracking measures  such as projected three year revenue from design wins and the capacity utilization of our fabrication facilities 
design win activity has been strong in though design wins in the second half of slowed from the pace set in the first half 
as a result  three year forecasted revenue for design wins in decreased approximately from our opportunity pipeline remains strong however  in we expect design wins to return to the pace of the first half of capacity utilization was in the fourth quarter of  compared to in the third quarter 
capacity utilization is a measure of the degree to which our manufacturing assets are being used and  correspondingly  our ability to absorb our fixed manufacturing costs into inventory 
our gross margins decreased in and could be negatively affected in the future if capacity utilization continues to decline 
other key metrics we use to analyze our business include days sales outstanding dso and days of inventory 
dso remained roughly flat quarter on quarter at days in the fourth quarter of days of inventory increased to in the fourth quarter of  up seven days sequentially  due to increased inventory on lower revenue 

table of contents in june  we acquired the mixed signal business of alcatel microelectronics nv from stmicroelectronics nv 
we refer to this as the msb acquisition 
the msb acquisition increased our analog and mixed signal engineering team  enhanced our relationships with major european customers  provided us with additional high voltage and wireless technologies that enable us to offer new types of custom integrated circuits to our end markets and provided us with two fabs in oudenaarde  belgium

critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures 
we have identified revenue recognition  inventories  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes and stock options as areas involving critical accounting policies and the most significant judgments and estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition several criteria must be met before we can recognize revenue from our products and revenue relating to engineering design and product development 
we must apply our judgment in determining when revenue recognition criteria are met 
we recognize revenue from products sold directly to end customers when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  delivery is fulfilled and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in certain situations  we ship products through freight forwarders 
in most cases  revenue is recognized when the product is delivered to the customer s carrier  regardless of the terms and conditions of sale 
the only exception is where title does not pass until the product is received by the customer 
in that case  revenue is recognized upon receipt by the customer 
estimates of product returns and allowances  based on actual historical experience and our knowledge of potential quality issues  are recorded at the time revenue is recognized or when quality issues are known and are deducted from revenue 
revenue from contracts to perform engineering design and product development is generally recognized as milestones are achieved  which approximates the percentage of completion method 
costs associated with such contracts are expensed as incurred  except as discussed below with regard to loss accruals recorded 
revenues under contracts acquired as part of the flextronics acquisition are recorded using the completed contract method 
this method is consistently applied to each contract and revenue is recognized accordingly when the item enters production or when the contract is complete 
under contracts for which revenue is recognized as milestones are achieved  a typical milestone billing structure is at the start of the project  at the creation of the reticle set and upon delivery of the prototypes 
since up to of revenue is billed and recognized at the start of the design development work and  therefore  could result in the acceleration of revenue recognition  we analyze those billings and the status of in process design development projects at the end of each quarter to determine that the milestone billings approximate percentage of completion on an aggregate basis 
we compare each project s stage with the total level of effort required to complete the project  which we believe is representative of the cost to complete method of determining percentage of completion 
based on this analysis  the relatively short term nature of our design development process and the billing and recognition of of the project revenue after design development work is complete which effectively defers of the revenue recognition to the end of the contract  we believe our milestone method approximates the percentage of completion method in all material respects 
our engineering design and product development contracts generally involve pre determined amounts of revenue 
we review each contract that is still in process at the end of each reporting period and estimate the cost of each activity yet to be performed under that contract 
this cost determination involves our judgment and the uncertainties inherent in the design and development of integrated circuits 
if we determine that our costs associated with a particular development contract exceed the revenue associated with such contract  we estimate the amount of the loss and establish a corresponding reserve 
inventories we generally initiate production of a majority of our semiconductors once we have received an order from a customer 
based on forecasted demand from specific customers or operational activities  we may build up inventories of finished goods in anticipation of subsequent purchase orders 
we purchase and maintain raw materials at sufficient levels to meet lead times based on forecasted demand 
if inventory quantity exceeds forecasted market demand  we may need to provide an allowance for excess or obsolete quantities 
forecasted demand is determined based on multiple factors including historical sales or inventory usage  expected future sales  other projections or the nature of the inventories 
we also review other inventories for indicators of impairment and provide an allowance as deemed necessary 

table of contents we state inventories at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market 
we determine the cost of inventory by adding an amount representative of manufacturing costs plus a burden rate for general manufacturing overhead to the inventory at major steps in the manufacturing process 
property  plant and equipment and intangible assets we regularly evaluate the carrying amounts of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or to the useful lives are required based on current circumstances or events 
the evaluation  which involves significant management judgment  is based on various analyses including cash flow and profitability projections 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of the related long lived assets  the carrying amount of the underlying assets will be reduced  with the reduction charged to expense so that the carrying amount is equal to fair value  primarily determined based on future discounted cash flows 
to the extent such evaluation indicates that the useful lives of property  plant and equipment are different than originally estimated  the amount of future depreciation expense is modified such that the remaining net book value is depreciated over the revised remaining useful life 
goodwill under the guidelines of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we assess goodwill at least annually for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned with the unit s net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  there is no deemed impairment of goodwill and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
we annually test our goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter 
since the adoption of sfas no 
in  our testing has not indicated any impairment 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized  and on the magnitude of any such impairment charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  we may obtain appraisals from independent valuation firms 
in addition to the use of independent valuation firms  we perform internal valuation analyses and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons of recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including the amount and timing of projected future cash flows  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to these comparables 
income taxes income taxes are recorded based on the liability method  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
table of contents measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount we determine is more likely than not to be realized based on our analyses of past operating results  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and projected taxable income  including tax strategies available to generate future taxable income 
our analyses of future taxable income are subject to a wide range of variables  many of which involve estimates  and therefore our deferred tax asset may not be ultimately realized 
utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation under the change of ownership provisions of the internal revenue code 
stock options as described in note to the audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised on january  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
this statement revises sfas  and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method and therefore  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the effect of sfas r 
share based compensation expense that was recorded in includes the compensation expense for the share based payments granted in the current year  as well as for the share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas as of december   the total compensation cost related to unvested share based awards granted to employees under our stock option plans but not yet recognized was approximately million  net of estimated forfeitures of million 
this expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years using the straight line method 
during the third quarter of  we implemented a change in our share based compensation strategy to utilize a combination of stock options and restricted stock units rsus that vest over time based on service  or vest based on a combination of performance and service rather than exclusively offering stock options 
on july   we granted  service based rsus to key exempt employees and  performance based rsus to a limited number of executive staff 
these rsus are included in the determination of total share based compensation expense 
the projected number of shares that will actually be issued pursuant to the performance based rsus is evaluated each reporting period and compensation expense is recognized only for those shares for which issuance is probable 
the number of shares that will be issued is calculated by estimating how actual business performance at the end of the measurement period will compare to predetermined performance targets 
as of december   we determined that it was not probable that any shares would be issued for under the performance based rsus 
consequently  no compensation expense was recognized during the fourth quarter of and the expense recognized during the third quarter of was reversed 
since the performance conditions were not met  these rsus will terminate on march  as of december   there were approximately million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to the service based rsus  net of estimated forfeitures of million 
compensation expense will be recognized over the vesting period of two or three years from the vesting commencement date using the straight line method 
we used the black scholes merton valuation model for our pro forma information required under sfas and continue to use this model to value any share based compensation under sfas r 
option valuation methods  including black scholes merton  require the input of assumptions including the risk free interest rate  dividend rate  expected term and volatility rate 
although the expected term and the volatility rate are highly subjective assumptions  a change of one year in the expected term for options granted during the most recent fiscal year affects share based compensation expense for that year by approximately and a change in the volatility rate affects the share based compensation expense for that year by approximately 
we adjust the compensation cost related to our share based plans for subsequent changes in estimated forfeitures 

table of contents as a result of adopting sfas r  our net income before income taxes was million lower and our net income is million lower for the year ended december  than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb we did not consider the impact on net income related to the rsus in making this calculation because compensation expense would have been required under apb as well 
basic and diluted earnings per share for the twelve month period ended december   are lower  respectively  than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb in accordance with sfas r  any cash flows resulting from the tax benefits for tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recorded for those options excess tax benefits will be classified as financing cash flows 
we recognized no excess tax benefits during prior to the adoption of sfas r  we followed the intrinsic value based method prescribed by apb  and related interpretations  in accounting for employee stock options 
we did not record any compensation expense for stock options we granted to our employees where the exercise price equaled the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and the exercise price  number of shares eligible for issuance under the options and vesting period were fixed 
we recorded deferred share based compensation when we granted stock options to employees at exercise prices less than the estimated fair market value of the underlying common stock on the grant date 
we complied with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 which required that we disclose our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per common share as if we had expensed the fair value of the options in determining net income or loss 
in calculating such fair value  we used certain assumptions  as disclosed in our consolidated financial statements 
in december  we accelerated the vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options that were previously awarded to employees and officers that had exercise prices per share of to  in anticipation of adopting sfas no 
r 
as a result  options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock became exercisable immediately 
we expected this acceleration to reduce the pre tax expense that we would have recognized with respect to share based compensation under adoption of sfas no 
r by approximately million in  million in  and million in the aggregate for and results of operations the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results  as derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue revenue in increased to million from million in the increases in revenue were due primarily to the flextronics acquisition  which accounted for approximately million of revenue in in  only million in revenue was recognized from the flextronics acquisition  as it closed on september  the starkey and nanoamp solutions acquisitions also increased revenue by million in excluding the effect of our acquisitions  organic revenue growth in was 
the organic increase for was driven primarily by higher revenues in our target markets  with the strongest growth being driven by the industrial market 
gartner february has forecasted consumption revenue growth for the application specific segment of the semiconductor industry to be approximately from to the application specific segment is split into two subsegments application specific integrated circuits and application specific standard products 
the application specific integrated circuit market is estimated to have grown approximately in the market for application specific standard products is estimated to have grown approximately over the same year over year period 
our revenues grew by  including the effect of acquisitions  from to  outperforming the forecasted growth of the application specific integrated circuit segment where the majority of our revenues were derived 
revenue from integrated mixed signal products for increased to million from million in the increase for was driven primarily by higher revenue in our target markets  with the strongest growth being driven by the industrial market and the contributions from our acquisitions 
during  integrated mixed signal saw a decrease in average selling prices but an increase in unit volumes sold compared to structured digital products revenue in increased to million from million in  driven primarily by higher revenue in the industrial and communications markets and the contribution from the flextronics acquisition 
during  this segment saw a decrease in average selling prices  but an increase in unit volumes sold compared to the following table represents our revenue by region for the years ended december north america europe asia gross profit cost of revenue consists primarily of purchased materials  labor and overhead including depreciation associated with the design and manufacture of products sold 
costs related to non recurring engineering fees are included in cost of revenue to the extent that they are reimbursed by our customers under a development arrangement as such reimbursements are recorded as revenue 
costs associated with unfunded non recurring engineering are classified as research and development because we typically retain ownership of the proprietary rights to intellectual property that has been developed in connection with non recurring engineering work 
gross profit was million  or of revenue  in compared to million  or of revenue  in the decrease in gross profit margin percentage was primarily due to continuing inefficiencies in our test operations resulting from the recently completed relocation to a new facility in the philippines  as well as an unfavorable product mix and price decreases 
during the second half of  some progress was made in our philippine test operations  particularly tester utilization and cycle times 
further progress is expected to continue into in addition  share based compensation expense increased cost of revenue by million during 
table of contents operating expenses we began expensing share based compensation with the adoption of sfas r in the first quarter of see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report on form k for additional information 
as shown in the table below  share based compensation expense affected several operating expense line items in millions 
income statement category year ended december  cost of revenue research and development sales and marketing general and administrative research and development expenses consist primarily of activities related to process engineering  cost of design tools  investments in development libraries  technology license agreements and product development 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenue  in compared to million  or of revenue  in this increase in research and development expense was due primarily to the incremental expense from our acquisitions and share based compensation expense 
marketing and selling expenses consist primarily of commissions to sales representatives  salaries  benefits  and commissions of sales and marketing personnel and advertising and communication costs 
marketing and selling expenses increased to million  or of revenue  in from million  or of revenue  in this increase was primarily due to higher selling expenses on increased revenue  incremental expense from our acquisitions and share based compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of our administrative staff  professional fees related to audit and tax services and advisory fees for various consulting projects 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenue  in compared to million  or of revenue  in this increase was primarily due to incremental expense from our acquisitions and share based compensation expense 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets increased to million in from million in this increase was due to higher amortization expense related to intangible assets associated with our acquisitions in and a full year of amortization of intangibles purchased as part of the flextronics acquisition 
there were no in process research and development charges in compared with million in related to the flextronics acquisition 

table of contents we recorded million in restructuring and impairment charges in compared to million in net restructuring charges of million in relate to our restructuring plan  the consolidation of our fab into our fab facility in belgium and the relocation of our philippines facility  combined with the transfer of our wafer sort operations in the united states and belgium to our new facility in the philippines 
in addition  million was recorded in for impairment of certain equipment 
the amounts recorded in included charges for employee severance and other items as a result of our restructuring program announced in the fourth quarter of this program included headcount reductions related to the consolidation of our sort operations in the united states and belgium to the philippines  as well as other reductions in force resulting from cost containment measures 
following is a summary of the restructuring accrual as of and for the years ended december  and in millions severance costs lease termination costs facility relocation costs legal fees and other costs total balance at january  expense paid reserve reversal balance at december  expense paid reserve reversal balance at december  operating income operating income decreased to million  or of revenue  in compared to million  or of revenue  in operating income in included million of share based compensation expense  which was not recorded in share based compensation expense is not allocated to our reportable segments 
following is a discussion of operating income by segment 
integrated mixed signal products operating income was million  or of segment revenue  in compared to million  or of segment revenue  in this decrease in operating margin was primarily attributable to higher manufacturing costs  driven primarily by higher test costs  an unfavorable product mix and price decreases 
higher acquisition related intangible asset amortization also negatively impacted operating margin 
structured digital products operating income was million  or of segment revenue  in  compared to million  or of segment revenue  in this decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower gross margins due to increased manufacturing costs  an unfavorable product mix and price decreases 
net interest expense net interest expense for increased to million  compared to million in this increase in net interest expense was primarily attributable to a full year of interest expense associated with the addition of million to our term loan in september in connection with the flextronics acquisition and higher interest rates 

table of contents other expense other expense in decreased to million from million in this decrease is primarily due to charges associated with the redemption of our senior subordinated notes in the first quarter of there was no comparable amount during other expense in included a charge of million associated with the tender offer and redemption of our senior subordinated notes and a charge of million for the write off of deferred financing and other costs associated with our prior senior credit facility and senior subordinated notes 
income taxes income tax expense was million in compared with an income tax benefit of million in the effective tax rate for was 
the effective tax rate for was not a meaningful number 
the low effective tax rate in compared to the us statutory rate of was due to the continued release of our valuation allowance  tax credits and increased income in low tax jurisdictions 
the primary reason for recording a tax benefit on positive net income before taxes in is that there was a loss and a corresponding tax benefit recorded in the us for the year related to our debt refinancing activities in the first quarter  while at the same time there was income and a corresponding tax expense recorded in foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates 
while the income in the foreign jurisdictions more than offset the us losses in  the foreign tax expense was not large enough to offset the us tax benefit 
also benefiting the effective tax rates in both and was a reduction in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
based on projections of taxable income for future periods  we reversed approximately million of valuation allowance in each year 
we have reduced our deferred tax assets through the use of a valuation allowance to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we will continue to evaluate the need to increase or decrease the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets based upon the anticipated pre tax operating results of future periods 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue revenue in decreased to million from million in excluding revenues of million in due to the flextronics acquisition  revenue decreased to million in in we experienced a significant decrease in our communications end market driven by the loss of foundry revenues to stmicroelectronics as a result of the expiration of a take or pay contract in june across our other end markets  but primarily in automotive and industrial  we experienced a greater than normal roll off of revenues from older products in as compared to this was partially offset by increases in medical and military aerospace revenues 
the increase in medical revenues was due in part to a full year of revenues from our dspfactory acquisition in november integrated mixed signal revenue of million in decreased compared with sales of million 
in  we saw strong growth in the medical end market for this segment  offset by decreases in the communications end market for the reasons noted above 
this segment saw a decrease in average selling prices  due in part to pricing changes  as well as to changes in the product mix  which was partially offset by an increase in unit volume sold  due to greater product offerings with the addition of revenue from the dspfactory and flextronics acquisitions 
structured digital products revenue was million in  a decrease of over revenue of million 
increased revenue from the military aerospace and industrial end markets were offset by decreases in the communications and computing end markets in this segment saw a decrease in average selling prices  due primarily to changes in the product mix  which was partially offset by an increase in unit volume sold  due to greater product offerings with the addition of revenue from the flextronics acquisition 
we formerly had a third segment  mixed signal foundry services  which we have combined into the integrated mixed signal products segment 

table of contents the following table represents our revenue by region for the years ended december north america europe asia gross profit gross profit decreased to million  or of revenue  in from million  or of revenue  in the decrease in gross profit percentage is a result of decreased utilization of our wafer fabrication facilities  inefficiencies related to the relocation of our test operations in the philippines and the transfer of our sort operations from pocatello and oudenaarde to the philippines  and a million charge related to discussions involving a previous quality issue with one customer 
operating expenses research and development expenses increased to million  or of revenue  in from million  or of revenue  in this increase is primarily attributable to higher expenses driven by increased design wins and the associated non customer funded expenses  as well as incremental expense from the flextronics acquisition 
marketing and selling expenses decreased to million  or of revenue  in from million  or of revenue  in this decrease is due to decreased costs associated with lower sales levels as well as the results of cost reduction efforts  including focusing on the use of internal sales people rather than sales rep firms  partially offset by additional costs related to the flextronics acquisition 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million  or of revenue  in from million  or of revenue  in this decrease was primarily due to lower management incentive plan costs in as our financial performance did not meet the minimum requirements to trigger payments under the plan 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets increased to million from million in this increase is due to a full year of amortization of intangible assets associated with the dspfactory acquisition as well as a partial year of amortization of the intangible assets associated with the flextronics acquisition 
in process research and development charges were million in related to the flextronics acquisition compared with million in related to the dspfactory acquisition 

table of contents we recorded a net million in restructuring charges in  compared to million in the amounts in are related to several restructuring plans  including the announced consolidation of our fab in belgium and the relocation of our philippines facility combined with the transfer of our wafer sort operations in the united states and belgium to our new facility in the philippines 
the amount in included charges for employee severance and other items as a result of our restructuring program announced in the fourth quarter of this program included headcount reductions related to the consolidation of our sort operations in the united states and belgium to the philippines  as well as other reductions in force resulting from cost containment measures 
following is a summary of the restructuring accrual as of and for the years ended december  and in millions severance costs lease termination costs legal fees and other costs total balance at january  expense paid balance at december  expense paid reserve reversal balance at december  operating income operating income decreased to million  or of revenue  in compared with million  or of revenue  in  driven by lower revenues  lower gross profit margin and higher operating expenses  particularly intangible amortization and research and development costs 
integrated mixed signal products operating income decreased to million  or of segment revenue in from million  or of segment revenue  in this decrease is attributable to lower revenue levels and lower capacity utilization  which drove higher per unit product costs and a reallocation of resources to support this segment s design win activity 
structured digital products operating income increased to million  or of segment revenue in from million  or of segment revenue  in this increase is attributable to improved product sales mix and a decrease in operating expense due to a reallocation of resources to support integrated mixed signal design win activity 
net interest expense net interest expense for decreased to million  compared with million in the lower interest expense was primarily attributable to the redemption of our senior subordinated notes see further discussion in liquidity and capital resources  partially offset by a higher balance on our term loan beginning in september due to additional financing obtained in conjunction with the flextronics acquisition 
other expense other expense in increased to million from million in this increase is primarily due to charges associated with the redemption of our senior subordinated notes in the first quarter of 
table of contents income taxes income tax benefit was million in compared with an income tax expense of million in the effective tax rate for was not a meaningful number 
the effective tax rate was in the primary reason for recording a tax benefit on positive net income before taxes in is that there was a loss and a corresponding tax benefit recorded in the us for the year related to our debt refinancing activities in the first quarter  while at the same time there was income and a corresponding tax expense recorded in foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates 
while the income in the foreign jurisdictions more than offset the us losses in  the foreign tax expense was not large enough to offset the us tax benefit 
contributing to the large us tax benefit was a reduction in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
based on projections of taxable income for future periods  we reversed approximately million of valuation allowance in and million in we have reduced our deferred tax assets through the use of a valuation allowance to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
liquidity and capital resources our principal cash requirements are to fund working capital needs  meet required debt payments  including debt service payments on our senior credit facilities  complete planned maintenance of equipment and equip our fabrication facilities 
we anticipate that cash flow from operations  together with available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet working capital needs  interest payment requirements on our debt obligations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
although we believe these resources may also meet our liquidity needs beyond that period  the adequacy of these resources will depend on our growth  semiconductor industry conditions and the capital expenditures necessary to support capacity and technology improvements 
our senior credit facilities consist of a million senior secured term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
we made a voluntary million prepayment toward the term loan on december   and the remaining balance of the term loan was million as of december  the term loan requires principal payments  together with accrued interest  on the last day of march  june  september and december of each year  with the balance due on april  the amortization schedule for the required quarterly principal payments changed due to this prepayment  and the revised required quarterly principal payment amount is now million 
the interest rate on the senior secured term loan on december   was  based on libor 
the revolving credit facility million of which may be in the form of letters of credit is available for working capital and general corporate purposes 
these credit facilities require us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio and contain certain other nonfinancial covenants  all as defined within the credit agreement

to have a material effect on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in the results of our operations and cash flows 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency and interest rate risks 
these risks primarily relate to the sale of products and services to foreign customers and changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
we have foreign currency exposure related to our operations in belgium as well as other foreign locations 
this foreign currency exposure  primarily related to euro denominated instruments  is due to potential fluctuations in our annual sales and operating costs denominated in foreign currencies as well as exposure arising from the translation or remeasurement of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars 
for example  a substantial portion of our annual sales and operating costs are denominated in euros and we have exposure related to sales and operating costs increasing or decreasing based on changes in euro currency exchange rates 
we attempt to mitigate the impact of this exchange rate risk by utilizing financial instruments  including derivative transactions pursuant to our policies 
during december  we entered into a foreign exchange collar contract  which ensures conversion of million in the first quarter of at a rate of no less than and no more than per we also have foreign currency exposure arising from the translation or remeasurement of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which we are exposed to fluctuations include the euro  the japanese yen and the philippine peso 
if the us dollar increases in value against these foreign currencies  the value in us dollars of the assets and liabilities originally recorded in these foreign currencies will decrease 
conversely  if the us dollar decreases in value against these foreign currencies  the value in us dollars of the assets and liabilities originally recorded in these foreign currencies will increase 
thus  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to these foreign currencies have a direct impact on the value in us dollars of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  even if the value of these items has not changed in their original currency 
as of december   approximately of our consolidated net assets were attributable to subsidiaries that prepare their financial statements in foreign currencies 
as such  a change in the us dollar exchange rates in effect as of december   would cause a change in consolidated net assets of approximately million  primarily due to euro denominated exposures 
we attempt to mitigate the impact of this exchange rate risk by utilizing financial 
table of contents instruments  including derivative transactions  pursuant to our policies 
as of december   the existing forward contract to sell million on january  at a rate of per was offset by a spot contract to buy million at a rate of per the net difference of the contracts  as well as the net difference of previous contracts in of million  was recorded in other comprehensive income on our balance sheet 
the company currently does not have any forward contracts in place 
when forwards are used  they act as a hedging instrument to hedge net investment exposure in foreign subsidiaries 
the forward contracts are typically in euros and normally have maturities that do not exceed days 
all derivative contracts we entered into are components of our hedging program and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation or trading purposes 
when utilized  the fair value of our forward contracts is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market rates and prices 
if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken by against the foreign currencies that are hedged by our forward exchange contracts  the hypothetical value of the contracts would change accordingly 
however  these forward exchange contracts are hedges and consequently any market value gains or losses arising from these foreign exchange contracts should be offset by foreign exchange losses or gains on the underlying net assets and liabilities 
calculations of the above effects assume that each rate changed in the same direction at the same time relative to the us dollar 
the calculations reflect only those differences resulting from mechanically replacing one exchange rate with another 
they do not factor in any potential effects that changes in currency exchange rates may have on statement of operations translation  sales volume and prices and on local currency costs of production 
factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging programs include volatility of the currency and interest rate markets  availability of hedging instruments and the our ability to accurately project sales  expenses and cash balances 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from our analysis depending on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements and our actual exposures and hedges 
our exposure to interest rate risk consists of floating rate debt based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus an adjustable margin under our credit agreement 
a change of in the interest rate would cause a change of approximately million in interest expense 
we are also subject to interest rate risks on our current cash and cash equivalent balances 
for example  if the interest rate on our interest bearing investments were to change basis points  interest income would have hypothetically increased or decreased by million during this hypothetical analysis does not take into consideration the effects of the economic conditions that would give rise to such an interest rate change or our potential response to such hypothetical conditions 
cash and cash equivalents include all marketable securities purchased with maturities of three or fewer months 
cash equivalents at december  and  consisted primarily of investments in money market funds
