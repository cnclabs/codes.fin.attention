overview celebrate express is a leading provider of celebration products serving families with young children via the internet and catalogs 
we offer a broad assortment of proprietary and third party children s party products and children s costumes complemented by a wide variety of accessories 
our centralized inventory management system maximizes product availability and allows us to customize our product assortment to meet specific customer needs 
we have designed our business infrastructure to share distribution  customer support  marketing and technology resources across all of our brands  while the predictable demand for our celebration products and the diversity of our brand portfolio have also served to minimize the seasonality of our business 
our goal is to help families celebrate the special moments in their lives 
we were incorporated as birthday express  inc  launched our direct marketing catalog and began offering products for sale in june in april  we launched our branded website  www 
birthdayexpress 
com 
late in  we began the process of bringing production in house  including the acquisition of production equipment and the expansion of our proprietary designs  and in december  we began producing products in our kirkland  washington facility 
in january  we opened a fulfillment center in greensboro  north carolina to expand our distribution capacity and reduce shipping expenses 
in april  we acquired certain assets of storybook inc  a direct marketer of young girls special occasion apparel  however  in june we began an orderly wind down of the operations of this brand  which was completed as of the end of fiscal in september  we started our costume express website and catalog providing halloween and dress up clothing for families with young children 
in february  we transitioned all of the traffic from our various websites to one centralized  customer facing website at celebrateexpress 
com 
we utilize various tabs on this website to highlight our multiple product categories and increase cross selling of our products to our customers and prospects 
we review our operations based on our financial results and various non financial measures 
we focus on several financial factors including net sales per order  gross margin  growth in net sales and the percentage of our sales generated by repeat customers 
we plan to market our brands to our customer database to increase sales from repeat customers 
we also plan to increase the number of proprietary products that we offer with the goal of maintaining high gross margins over time while differentiating us from our competitors 
among the key non financial measures upon which we focus in reviewing performance are the frequency of purchase by our customers and the number of new customers added to our database 
we believe that expansion of our product and brand offerings will increase the frequency of purchase by our customers and provide an additional opportunity to capture new customers 
to date  we have derived our revenue primarily from the sale of party related products from our birthday express website and catalog 
for the fiscal year ended may   we generated million in net sales  a decrease of from million in the fiscal year ended may  in fiscal  our birthday express brand accounted for approximately of our net sales 
our website represented our fastest growing sales channel comprising approximately of our net sales in fiscal  compared with of net sales in fiscal in the fiscal year just ended  our net sales per order was and more than of our sales came from repeat customers

net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in net sales is due primarily to the wind down of the storybook heirlooms brand

birthday express net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of  or approximately 
costume express net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of million or approximately due primarily to an increase in direct marketing expense

the change in net sales in fiscal over the same period in reflects an increase of approximately in the number of orders shipped  which grew to approximately  orders in fiscal from approximately  orders in fiscal net sales per order for fiscal was  compared with net sales per order of for fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease in net sales per order was due in part to a decrease in the net sales per order 
table of contents for our storybook heirlooms brand  which decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal as we wound down the operations of the brand and liquidated the remaining inventory 
we added approximately  new customers to our database during fiscal  compared with approximately  new customers added in fiscal  an increase of approximately 
revenue from our repeat customers represented approximately of revenue during fiscal compared with approximately during fiscal gross margin our gross margin consists of net sales less cost of sales 
our cost of sales consists primarily of product costs  costs associated with our in house production facility  including wages and depreciation  design and production costs for our apparel and costume brands  inbound and outbound shipping costs  and packaging materials for outbound shipments 
gross margin increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our gross margin percentage increased to of net sales in fiscal from in fiscal several factors contributed to this change 
merchandise margins in both the birthday express and costume express brands increased in fiscal from fiscal due to the efforts of our purchasing and merchandising groups 
the company also benefited from a shift in product mix away from the lower margin storybook heirlooms brand  which represented only of net sales during fiscal  compared with of net sales during the prior year 
shipping margins improved from the prior year as we shifted deliveries back toward ground shipments rather than expedited methods 
in the prior year the company had higher order backlogs  causing more shipments to be sent air freight at the company s expense to meet customer delivery expectations 
improvements in distribution center processes enabled the company to meet or exceed customer expectations using ground delivery methods during fiscal we also recorded  of advertising revenue during fiscal generated from web advertising sources with no corresponding cost of goods sold  while no advertising revenue was recorded during fiscal our gross margin includes the cost of shipping packages to our customers 
we have seen increases in these outbound shipping costs as a result of increases in fuel surcharges and rates charged by our third party carriers 
further increases in these costs will have an impact on our gross margin 
our gross margin may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the mix of products sold  as well as the potential introduction of new brands 
fulfillment our fulfillment expenses consist primarily of labor and other operating costs associated with our customer support center in kirkland  washington and our distribution center and customer support operations in greensboro  north carolina 
our fulfillment expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  these expenses remained relatively consistent at in fiscal and in fiscal in the first two quarters of fiscal  we continued to incur higher than anticipated costs related to the company s transition to a more automated picking process that was implemented in fiscal  including increases in labor  overtime and temporary labor costs incurred to ship customer orders 
in the last two quarters of fiscal  however  fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales were lower than in the comparable periods in fiscal as our operations were stabilized and error rates and on time shipments returned to historical levels 
in april the company announced the closure of its customer service and print manufacturing operations in kirkland  washington 
with that closure now complete  all of the company s customer service  distribution and print manufacturing operations are now located in greensboro  north carolina 
our distribution costs can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon the mix of products sold 
orders from our birthday express brand are generally more time intensive in the distribution center due to more items being sold  on average  on each order 
selling and marketing our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising costs  wages and related payroll benefits for our internal marketing and merchandising staff 
advertising costs include online marketing efforts  print advertising and other direct marketing strategies 
online advertising costs are generally expensed as incurred 
prepaid direct marketing expenses consist of third party costs including paper  printing and mailing costs and are capitalized and amortized over their expected period of future benefit  which is generally from to days 
selling and marketing costs increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to increases in online advertising and direct marketing circulation costs of million 
as a percentage of 
table of contents net sales  selling and marketing expenses were in fiscal  compared with in fiscal the increase in marketing costs as a percentage of net sales is due primarily to reductions in catalog response rates and net sales per order from the prior year 
we have experienced increases  and are potentially subject to further increases  in our online paid search costs  paper prices and postage rates 
the united states postal service announced an increase in postage rates which we anticipate will increase our outbound postage costs for catalog deliveries by approximately 
the company was first impacted by this increase in june general and administrative our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and related payroll benefits for our administrative and technology employees 
these expenses also include credit card fees  legal and accounting professional fees  insurance  network fees  systems depreciation  bad debt expense  and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the change in general and administrative expenses is due primarily to increases in wages and benefits for our administrative and technology employees of million  and stock compensation expense due to the adoption of fas r of  as a percentage of net sales  our general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal also included in general and administrative expenses in the current fiscal year is approximately  associated with the company s april announcement of its plans to consolidate its customer service and print manufacturing operations into its greensboro  north carolina facility 
these costs include severance costs  expenses related to the transportation of products and equipment to greensboro  and other related costs 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods primarily as a result of the recent hiring of additional executives  costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance and other accounting and legal costs  and the continued recording of stock based compensation expense under sfas r 
severance and related costs severance and related costs incurred during fiscal relate to employee terminations that took place on july  included in the million severance and related cost balance is approximately  in cash severance payments and related payroll taxes 
the remainder of the balance is composed of legal fees incurred by the company relating to the severance negotiations and the terminated employees legal complaint for wrongful termination 
the expense related to these terminations was taken in the second quarter of fiscal  at which time we agreed to settlement of all claims including claims of wrongful termination by these former employees 
there were no significant severance and related costs in fiscal other income expense  net the improvement in other income to million in fiscal  compared with other income of million in fiscal  is due primarily to increased interest rates earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
on march   our board of directors declared a one time dividend of per share  which totaled approximately million 
as this special dividend represented approximately one third of our cash and cash equivalents  this dividend will materially reduce our interest income in future periods 
income taxes in fiscal  we recognized income tax expense of  on income before taxes of  in fiscal  we recognized income tax expense of  on income before taxes of  our effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately  compared with an effective tax rate of in fiscal the high effective tax rate for fiscal is driven by the effect of non deductible expenses on our relatively low level of pretax income 
as of may   the company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of million that are scheduled to expire between and if unused 
pursuant to internal revenue code section  the company continually evaluates whether ownership changes have occurred resulting in annual limitations to the utilization of the deferred tax asset associated with its net operating losses 
during fiscal  the 
table of contents company experienced an ownership change resulting in a limitation event 
we have considered this limitation as well as future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we believe that all net deferred tax assets shown on our balance sheet as of may   are more likely than not to be realized in the future and no valuation allowance is necessary 
in the event that actual results differ from those estimates or we adjust those estimates in future periods  we may need to record a valuation allowance  which would reduce deferred tax assets and the results of operations in the period the change is made

gross margin gross margin increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our gross margin percentage declined to of net sales in fiscal from in fiscal the primary factors contributing to this change were increases in outbound shipping costs and lower gross margins in our storybook brand 
the increases in outbound shipping charges are due primarily to the company upgrading orders at its expense to ensure that packages timely arrived at the customers homes  as well as increased fuel surcharges and third party carrier rates 
fulfillment our fulfillment expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase is due primarily to higher than anticipated costs related to the company s transition to a more automated picking process

as a percentage of net sales  our general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal other income expense  net the improvement in other income to million in fiscal  compared with other income of  in fiscal  is due primarily to the full year impact of interest earned from the proceeds from our initial public offering and the repayment of our million term loan in fiscal income taxes in fiscal  we recognized income tax expense of  on income before taxes of  our effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately

liquidity and capital resources as of may  we had working capital of million 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  as well as cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to continue our operations and meet our capital needs for the foreseeable future 
net cash provided by operating activities was  and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal can be attributed primarily to depreciation and amortization of million and stock compensation of million 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million during  which was driven primarily by the introduction of our deferred billing program 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was used for purchases of fixed assets 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal and was used for capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal cash used in financing activities in fiscal was primarily due to the payment of a one time special dividend on april   which was slightly offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options

table of contents critical accounting policies certain of our accounting policies require the application of management judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosures made in the accompanying notes 
those estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors deemed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
the use of judgment in determining such estimates and assumptions is  by nature  subject to a degree of uncertainty 
accordingly  actual results could differ from the estimates made 
the following are the critical accounting policies that we believe require significant estimation and management judgment 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue and the related cost of sales on the date on which we estimate that the customer has received the product 
we require payment for the goods prior to shipment  which is recorded as deferred revenue until the estimated date the customer has received the shipment 
we utilize our third party freight carrier information to estimate when delivery has been made 
we estimate potential future product returns related to current period revenue by analyzing historical customer returns 
actual returns may differ materially from our estimated reserve 
as a result  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying statutory rates in effect in the years in which the differences between the financial reporting and tax filing bases of existing assets and liabilities are expected to reverse 
we have incurred significant losses in years prior to fiscal for which no income tax benefit had been recognized 
significant judgment related to future taxable income is required in estimating the likelihood of recoverability of tax benefits related to those net operating losses 
we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we believe that all net deferred tax assets shown on our balance sheet as of may   are more likely than not to be realized in the future and no valuation allowance is necessary 
in the event that actual results differ from those estimates or we adjust those estimates in future periods  we may need to record a valuation allowance  which would reduce deferred tax assets and the results of operations in the period the change is made 
stock based compensation effective june   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost recognized includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of june   which is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fas r  recognized over the vesting period of the underlying options using the single option approach  b compensation cost for all share based payments granted on or subsequent to june   which is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r  recognized over the requisite service period of the award on a straight line basis  and c compensation cost for shares issued under the espp  which is based on the fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r and is not considered material to our overall consolidated financial statements 
we calculate the fair value of our stock options granted to employees using the black scholes option pricing model using the single option approach 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
our computation of expected volatility is based on our historical volatility 
our computation of expected life is determined using the simplified method outlined by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  or sab under this method  our expected term is equal to the sum of the weighted average vesting term plus the original contractual term divided by two 
we base the risk free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term 
a dividend yield of was considered appropriate due to the lack of historical 
table of contents dividends paid 
although a dividend was paid to shareholders in april  this is considered a special one time dividend that is not indicative of future dividend activity 
when estimating forfeitures  we considered historical termination behavior  in addition to analyzing actual option forfeitures 
our forfeiture rate is based on the weighted average termination behavior of our employees and board members  which is approximately 
prior to the adoption of fas r  we recognized the impact of forfeitures when they occurred 
see note of our financial statements  stock based compensation  included in part ii  item of this annual report 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or damage for the excess cost of the inventory over estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if the actual market conditions or demand for our products are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued interpretation no

fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin will be effective as of june  we do not expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
the eitf reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure 
eitf is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after december  the company adopted this issue for the quarter ended may  the company collects amounts from customers  which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes  and records these amounts on a net basis 
the company has not modified this accounting policy  therefore  the adoption of eitf did not have any effect on the company s financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas establishes a common definition for fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we will apply this guidance beginning june  we do not expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  fas 
fas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
fas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we will apply this guidance beginning june  we do not expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly rated securities 
as of may  we held short term investments that had maturity dates of three months or less at the time of purchase  and consist primarily of money market accounts and commercial paper 
because of the short term nature of our investments  we believe that our exposure to market rate fluctuations on those investments is minimal 
on may   we had no long term or short term bank debt outstanding 
foreign currency risk our revenue  expense and capital expenditures are transacted in us dollars 
we do source a portion of our product inventories from foreign vendors  primarily manufacturers in china 
if the value of the us dollar declines relative to the chinese yuan  these foreign currency fluctuations could result in an increase in the cost of merchandise sourced from china through price increases 
as a result of such fluctuations  we may experience fluctuations in our operating results on an annual or quarterly basis
