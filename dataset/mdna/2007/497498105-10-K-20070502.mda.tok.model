our fiscal year is comprised of the or week period ending on the saturday closest to january accordingly  fiscal represented weeks ended on february  fiscal represented weeks ended on january  fiscal represented weeks ended on january  introduction we are a leading specialty retailer of home d cor in the united states  operating stores in states as of february  our stores present a broad selection of distinctive merchandise  including framed art  mirrors  wall d cor  candles  lamps  decorative accessories  accent furniture  textiles  garden accessories and artificial floral products 
our stores also offer an extensive assortment of holiday merchandise  as well as items carried throughout the year suitable for giving as gifts 
for the fiscal year ended february   we recorded total revenues of million  which included approximately million related to the initial recording of gift certificate and gift card breakage 
our stores offer a unique combination of style and value that has led to our emergence as a leader in home d cor and has enabled us to develop a strong customer franchise 
as a result  we have achieved substantial growth and have expanded our store base into different regions of the country 
during the past nine years  we have more than doubled our store base  principally through new store openings 
we intend to continue opening new stores both in existing and new markets 
we anticipate our growth will include primarily off mall locations in major metropolitan markets  middle markets and selected smaller communities 
over the long term  we believe there are currently more than additional locations in the united states that could support a kirkland s store 
in the near term  we plan to grow prudently with a focus on shifting the store base from the mall to the off mall locations 
for fiscal  we plan on opening approximately new stores and estimate closing approximately stores in fiscal 
table of contents overview of key financial measures net sales and gross profit are the most significant drivers to our operating performance 
net sales consists of all merchandise sales to customers net of returns and exclusive of sales taxes 
our net sales for fiscal  including the extra week in the retail calendar increased by to million from million in fiscal  reflecting sales from the new stores we opened in fiscal as well as sales increases from the stores we opened in fiscal comparable store sales declined for fiscal we use comparable store sales to measure our ability to achieve sales increases from stores that have been open for at least full fiscal months 
increases in comparable store sales are an important factor in maintaining or increasing the profitability of existing stores 
gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of sales 
cost of sales has four distinct components product cost including inbound freight  outbound freight cost  store occupancy cost and central distribution cost 
product cost comprises the majority of cost of sales  while central distribution cost is the least significant of these four elements 
product and freight cost are variable  while occupancy and distribution costs are largely fixed 
accordingly  gross margin gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales can be influenced by many factors including overall sales performance 
for fiscal  gross profit increased to million from million for fiscal this increase reflects the recognition of the million in gift certificate and gift card breakage revenue in fiscal after completing a review of our historical redemption patterns during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized million of revenue and operating income related to gift certificate and gift card breakage 
there was no revenue recognized on unredeemed gift certificates or gift card balances prior to fiscal because sufficient data was not available during those periods to support an alternative position 
gross margin for fiscal increased to of total revenue from of total revenue for fiscal  primarily due to the recognition of the million in gift certificate and gift card breakage revenue in fiscal and a better occupancy cost ratio due to the shift to off mall locations 
operating expenses  including the costs of operating our stores and corporate headquarters  are also an important component of our operating performance 
compensation and benefits comprise the majority of our operating expenses 
operating expenses contain fixed and variable costs  and managing the operating expense ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales is an important focus of management as we seek to maintain or increase our overall profitability 
operating expenses include cash costs as well as non cash costs such as depreciation and amortization 
due to the significant fixed cost component of operating expenses  as well as the tendency of many operating costs to rise over time  increases in comparable store sales are typically necessary in order to prevent meaningful increases in the operating expense ratio 
operating expenses can also include certain costs that are of a one time or non recurring nature 
while these costs must be considered to understand fully our operating performance  we typically identify such costs separately where significant on the consolidated statement of operations so that we can evaluate comparable expense data across different periods 
a complete evaluation of our financial performance incorporates not only operating results  but also an assessment of how effectively we are deploying our capital 
we believe that a high return on capital is an indicator of a financially productive business 
accordingly  we evaluate our earnings in relation to inventories and total assets in order to determine if we are achieving acceptable levels of return on our capital 
inventory yield gross profit divided by average inventories and return on assets net income divided by total assets are two of the measures we use 

table of contents we use a number of key performance measures to evaluate our financial performance  including the following fiscal year net sales growth comparable store sales growth average net sales per store in thousands average net sales per square foot gross profit as a percentage of net sales compensation and benefits as a percentage of net sales other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales inventory yield return on assets roa fiscal results reflect a week retail calendar  while fiscal and fiscal reflects a week retail calendar 
calculated using net sales of all stores open at both the beginning and the end of the period indicated 
calculated using the gross square footage of all stores open at both the beginning and the end of the period 
gross square footage includes the storage  receiving and office space that generally occupies approximately of total store space 
inventory yield is defined as gross profit including gift certificate and gift card breakage divided by average inventory for each of the preceding four quarters 
return on assets equals net income including gift certificate and gift card breakage divided by total assets 
strategic areas of emphasis the downturn in our financial performance for the last three fiscal years has primarily resulted from declining comparable store sales and cumulative decreases in our merchandise margin 
accordingly  a central area of emphasis for fiscal is improving the productivity of our merchandise assortment 
this effort encompasses process improvement in identifying and growing appealing merchandise  planning and product allocation  enhancement of merchandising personnel and department structure  and evaluation of competitive factors 
a major part of this effort is broadening the trends and style within our assortment and therefore its appeal to a larger customer base 
during  we are focused on providing a merchandise mix that reflects an updated  trend right style combined with a key item focus with an emphasis on value 
an equally important area of emphasis is enhancing the store experience by improving guest service 
given a competitive retail environment  our in store guest experience is a key differentiator 
training and store level incentives for achievement of guest service goals and metrics will be a focus for us in fiscal we will measure our success in these initiatives through monitoring key performance metrics including comparable stores sales  conversion rate transactions divided by traffic count  average dollar transactions  employee turnover rate  and mystery shop results 
the increase in our store base during fiscal reflected a continued commitment to prudent growth 
capital expenditures for fiscal were million  of which million was related to leasehold improvements  equipment and fixtures for new stores 
the construction of new stores will continue to be an important part of our strategy in fiscal we plan on opening approximately new stores and closing approximately stores during the upcoming year 
our stores historically have operated primarily in enclosed malls  but in fiscal we opened of our new stores in a variety of off mall venues including lifestyle centers  power centers and outlet centers 
in fiscal  all of our new stores were located in off mall venues 
in fiscal all but one of our new stores were located in these off mall venues 
at 
table of contents february   we operated of our stores in non mall venues  and we anticipate that substantially all of our new store openings in fiscal will be in off mall venues 
typically these off mall stores have been able to achieve higher sales volumes with lower total occupancy costs generating higher store contribution than our mall stores 
the following table summarizes our stores and square footage under lease in mall and off mall locations as of february  and january  as of as of february  january  mall off mall total mall off mall total number of stores square footage average square footage per store for the fiscal year ended for the fiscal year ended february  january  mall off mall total mall off mall total average net sales per store in thousands average net sales per square foot calculated using net sales of all stores open at both the beginning and the end of the period indicated 
the decrease in net sales per square foot from fiscal to was due primarily to the comparable store sales decrease coupled with a higher average square footage per store in fiscal another important area of emphasis will be improving the effectiveness of our supply chain 
we commenced operations in a new distribution center in the second quarter of fiscal this facility replaced the three buildings that previously supported our central distribution effort 
the commencement of operations in the new distribution center was accompanied by the implementation of a new warehouse management system as well as investments in material handling equipment designed to streamline the flow of goods within the distribution center 
in fiscal and beyond  our goal is to achieve better labor productivity  better transportation efficiency  leaner store level inventories and reduced store level storage costs 
our objective is to finance all of our operating and investing activities with cash provided by operations and borrowings under our revolving credit line 
our cash balances increased to million at february  from million at january  we expect that capital expenditures for fiscal will range from to million  primarily to fund the leasehold improvements of approximately new stores and maintain our investments in existing stores  our distribution center and information technology infrastructure 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of our operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts contained in the financial statements and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
certain judgments and estimates utilized in implementing these accounting policies are likewise discussed in each of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion aggregates the various critical accounting policies addressed throughout the financial statements  the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of 
table of contents these policies and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under varying conditions and assumptions 
cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization and inventory valuation cost of sales includes all costs of product purchased from vendors  including inbound freight to the extent that it is not included in the vendor pricing 
receiving costs  inspection costs  warehousing costs  internal transfer costs  outbound freight  and all overhead associated with our distribution facility and its network are included in the cost of sales 
our cost of sales also includes store occupancy costs 
our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  net of reserves and allowances  with cost determined using the average cost method with average cost approximating current cost 
we estimate the amount of shrinkage that has occurred through theft or damage and adjust that to actual at the time of our physical inventory counts which occur throughout the fiscal year 
we also evaluate the cost of our inventory by category and class of merchandise in relation to the estimated sales price 
this evaluation is performed to ensure that we do not carry inventory at a value in excess of the amount we expect to realize upon the sale of the merchandise 
we believe we have the appropriate merchandise valuation and pricing controls in place to minimize the risk that our inventory values would be materially misstated 
impairments in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of long lived assets  such as property and equipment  covered by this standard whenever events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as part of the evaluation  we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period cash flow losses that should be considered for impairment 
we compare the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows with the carrying amounts of the assets 
if impairment is indicated by the above evaluation  the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets is recognized as an impairment loss where fair value is estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows 
cash flows for retail assets are identified at the individual store level 
our judgments regarding a store s ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of store assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long lived assets  these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges 
based on the estimated fair values of certain long lived assets  we have recorded impairment charges of   and  during fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
depreciation approximately of our assets at february   represent investments in property and equipment 
determining appropriate depreciable lives requires judgments and estimates 
we utilize the straight line method of depreciation and a variety of depreciable lives 
land is not depreciated 
buildings are depreciated over years 
furniture  fixtures and equipment are generally depreciated over years 
computer software and equipment is depreciated over years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful lives of the asset or the original non cancelable lease term 
our lease terms typically range from to years 
to the extent we replace or dispose of fixtures or equipment prior to the end of its assigned depreciable life  we could realize a loss or gain on the disposition 
to the extent our assets are used beyond their assigned depreciable life  no depreciation expense is being realized 
we reassess the depreciable lives in an effort to reduce the risk of significant losses or gains arising from either the disposition of our assets or the utilization of assets with no depreciation charges 
insurance reserves workers compensation  general liability and employee medical insurance programs are partially self insured 
it is our policy to record a self insurance liability using estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported or paid  based on historical claims experience and trends 
actual results can vary from estimates for many reasons  including  among others  inflation rates  claim settlement patterns  litigation trends and legal interpretations 
we monitor our claims experience in light of these factors and revise our estimates 
table of contents of insurance reserves accordingly 
the level of our insurance reserves may increase or decrease as a result of these changing circumstances or trends 
income taxes we record income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future tax effects from existing temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
we must make estimates and judgments on future taxable income  considering feasible tax planning strategies and taking into account existing facts and circumstances  to determine the proper valuation allowance 
when we determine that deferred tax assets could be realized in greater or lesser amounts than recorded  the asset balance and income statement reflects the change in the period such determination is made 
due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the proper valuation allowance  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and judgments could result in adjustments to this valuation allowance 
we use an estimate of our annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
stock options and warrants as of january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r which requires us to value and record  as compensation expense  stock awards granted to employees under a fair value based method 
prior to january   we accounted for stock awards granted to employees under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
except for certain options which were granted at an exercise price below the market value of the company s underlying common stock on the grant date  no compensation expense was previously recognized for stock options granted to employees prior to adopting sfas r 
sfas r applies to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased or canceled after january  and to those which were unvested at january  we have adopted sfas r utilizing the modified prospective transition method which requires share based compensation expense recognized since january   to be based on the following a grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas for unvested options granted prior to the adoption date  b grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r for options granted subsequent to the adoption date  and c the discount on shares purchased by employees through our employee stock purchase plan post adoption  which represents the difference between the grant date fair value and the employee purchase price 
this compensation expense was recorded in the statements of operations with a corresponding credit to common stock for the week period ended february  we use the black scholes merton option pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of earnings 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal results of operations 
the table below sets forth selected results of our operations in dollars and expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal change net sales gift certificate and gift card breakage revenue total revenue cost of sales gross profit operating expenses compensation and benefits other operating expenses impairment charge depreciation and amortization operating income loss interest income expense  net other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss net sales 
net sales  increased by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the net sales increase in fiscal resulted primarily from the opening of new stores 
we opened new stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal  and we closed stores in fiscal and stores in fiscal our net sales also benefited from sales increases from expanded  remodeled or relocated stores  which are excluded from our comparable store base 
the impact of these collective changes in the store base was offset by a decline of in comparable store sales for fiscal during fiscal  comparable store sales decreased 
comparable store sales in our mall store locations were down for the year  while comparable store sales for our off mall store locations were down 
the comparable store sales decline resulted from several factors  including a difficult sales environment in the home d cor retail sector and weak customer traffic trends 
the overall traffic declines led to lower transaction volumes 
customer conversion remained consistent with prior year 
the lower transaction volumes were partially offset by a higher average dollar transaction  driven by increases in our average retail selling price 
key categories that outperformed the prior year included alternative wall d cor  furniture  mirrors  floral and candles 
these increases were offset by declines in lamps  art  textiles  garden and novelty 
the growth in the store base along with sales from expanded  remodeled or relocated stores  and the additional retail week in fiscal accounted for an increase in net sales of million over the prior year 
this increase was partially offset by the negative comparable store sales performance  which accounted for a million decrease in net sales from the prior year including the additional retail week in fiscal gift certificate and gift card breakage revenue 
revenues from our gift certificates and gift cards are recognized when tendered for payment and included in net sales 
while we will continue to honor all gift certificates and gift cards presented for payment  we determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain gift certificates and gift card balances due to  among other things  long periods of inactivity 
in fiscal the company began using the redemption recognition method to account for breakage for unused gift card and gift certificate amounts where breakage is recognized as gift certificates or gift cards are redeemed for the purchase of goods based upon a historical breakage rate 
in these circumstances  to the extent we 
table of contents determine there is no requirement for remitting certificate or card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws  gift certificate and gift card balances are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of revenue 
after completing a review of its historical redemption patterns during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized million of revenue and operating income related to gift certificate and gift card breakage 
there was no revenue recognized on unredeemed gift certificates or gift card balances prior to fiscal because sufficient data was not available during those periods to support an alternative position 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue increased to for fiscal  from for fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of total revenue was primarily driven by the recognition of gift certificate and gift card breakage revenue

store occupancy costs decreased slightly as a percentage of total revenue  as the shift of the store base off mall resulted in a decline in rents per square foot leading to sales leverage 
freight expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenue despite rising fuel costs as we realized savings throughout the year due to the implementation of changes in our store delivery methods 
central distribution costs were unchanged as a percentage of net sales for the year 
compensation and benefits 
compensation and benefits  including both store and corporate personnel  was million  or of total revenue  for fiscal as compared to million  or for fiscal the increase in the compensation and benefits ratio was primarily due to the negative comparable store sales performance 
at the store level  payroll costs increased as a percentage of total revenue versus the prior year due to the comparable store sales decline and our inability to reduce hours enough to offset the impact 
at the corporate level  we incurred a pre tax expense of approximately  related to the first quarter termination of our former chief executive officer 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we incurred a pre tax expense of approximately  related to the post retirement benefit agreement with our current chief executive officer 
we also incurred a pre tax expense of approximately  related to our implementation of sfas r  the new accounting pronouncement concerning stock based compensation 
the company also recognized approximately  in pre tax stock compensation expense related to a restricted stock grant during the week period ended february  excluding the impact of these factors  corporate compensation and benefits declined as a percentage of sales due to tight management of corporate salaries and reduced hiring activity 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses  including both store and corporate costs  were million  or of total revenue  for fiscal as compared to million  or of total revenue  for fiscal the increase in these operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of the negative comparable store sales performance and the lack of a positive leveraging effect on the fixed components of store and corporate operating expenses 
store level operating expenses increased slightly as a percentage of total revenue due to higher utility costs related to our larger off mall stores and increases in insurance expense 
these increases were partly offset by a decrease in spending on advertising and promotion 
corporate level operating expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of total revenues compared to prior year 
this decline reflected reductions in both professional fees as well as relocation expenses related to new hire activity

table of contents interest expense  net 
interest expense was flat as a percentage of sales due to similar average revolver borrowings compared to the prior year period 
other income  net 
other income was higher than the prior year primarily due to the receipt of insurance proceeds of approximately  related to property damage caused by hurricane katrina 
income provision benefit 
income tax benefit was of the loss before income taxes for fiscal as compared to a provision of of income before income taxes for the prior year period 
the tax rate for fiscal reflects the impact of permanent differences associated with stock compensation expense recorded under sfas r as certain of the stock options outstanding are not structured to result in deductions on our income tax return 
net income loss 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported a net loss of  or per diluted share for fiscal compared to  or per diluted share for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal results of operations

comparable store sales in our mall store locations were down for the year  while comparable store sales for our off mall store locations were down 
lower customer traffic was the primary reason for the decrease in comparable store sales 
we attributed the traffic declines to a combination of the challenging competitive environment in the home d cor sector as well as our inability to present a compelling merchandise assortment to our customer base 
declines in customer traffic were most evident in our mall stores  as malls generally have been attracting fewer of our core female customers 
key categories that outperformed the prior year included candles  furniture  alternative wall d cor  mirrors and textiles 
these increases were offset by declines in art  lamps  garden  gift novelty and seasonal 
the growth in the store base along with sales from expanded  remodeled or relocated stores accounted for an increase of million over

store level operating expenses increased slightly as a percentage of sales due to greater spending on advertising and promotion as well as increases in expenses associated with the increased penetration of our private label credit card loyalty program 
additionally  utilities costs increased during the year due to rising energy costs and our implementation of a wide area network during the second quarter of fiscal these increases were partially offset by decreases in storage and related equipment rental costs due to improved distribution efficiencies

net income 
as a result of the foregoing  net income was  or per diluted share for fiscal compared to million  or per diluted share for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements are for working capital and capital expenditures 
working capital consists mainly of merchandise inventories offset by accounts payable  which typically reach their peak by the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year 
capital expenditures primarily relate to new store openings  existing store expansions  remodels or relocations  and purchases of equipment or information technology assets for our stores  distribution facilities or corporate headquarters 
historically  we have funded our working capital and capital expenditure requirements with internally generated cash and borrowings under our credit facility 
cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities depends heavily on operating performance  changes in working capital and the timing and amount of payments for income taxes 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to a reduction in overall inventory levels at year end when compared with inventory level increases at the end of fiscal inventory levels decreased over the prior year as we carefully managed our open to buy dollars throughout fiscal in response to a difficult sales environment 
operating cash flow for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal due to reduced earnings performance 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these amounts consisted primarily of capital expenditures offset slightly by proceeds received from the sale of certain assets as well as the repayment of a shareholder loan

during fiscal  we opened new stores 
we expect that capital expenditures for fiscal will range from to million  primarily to fund the leasehold improvements of approximately new stores  the maintenance of our investments in stores  information technology  and the distribution center  and our establishment of a satellite office in nashville  tennessee 
we also expect that capital expenditures  including leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  and equipment for our fiscal new stores will average approximately  to  per store 
we anticipate that we will continue to receive landlord allowances  which help to reduce our cash invested in leasehold improvements 
these allowances are reflected as a component of cash flows from operating activities within our consolidated statement of cash flows 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities for fiscal were primarily comprised of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility 
the facility was drawn to a peak of million and paid down to zero by the end of the fiscal year

cash flows from financing activities also include cash received for exercises of employee stock options  as well as cash paid for issue costs on indebtedness 

table of contents revolving credit facility 
effective october   we entered into a five year senior secured revolving credit facility with a revolving loan limit of up to million 
the revolving credit facility bears interest at a floating rate equal to the day libor rate at february  plus to depending on the amount of excess availability under the borrowing base 
additionally  we pay a fee to the bank equal to a rate of per annum on the unused portion of the revolving line of credit 
borrowings under the facility are collateralized by substantially all of our assets and guaranteed by our subsidiaries 
the maximum availability under the credit facility is limited by a borrowing base formula  which consists of a percentage of eligible inventory less reserves 
the facility also contains provisions that could result in changes to the presented terms or the acceleration of maturity 
circumstances that could lead to such changes or acceleration include a material adverse change in the business or an event of default under the credit agreement 
the facility has one financial covenant that requires the company to maintain excess availability under the borrowing base  as defined in the credit agreement  of million at all times 
the facility matures in october as of february   we were in compliance with the covenants in the facility and there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
at february   our balance of cash and cash equivalents was million and the borrowing availability under our facility was million net of the million availability block as described above 
we believe that these sources of cash  together with cash provided by our operations  will be adequate to carry out our fiscal plans in full and fund our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations 
the following table identifies payment obligations for the periods indicated under our current contractual arrangements
