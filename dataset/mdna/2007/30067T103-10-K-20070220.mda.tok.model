item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto set forth in item overview the company designs  manufactures and markets a variety of photonics based solutions primarily consisting of laser systems and electro optical components for industrial and scientific applications 
the company s current range of products include laser marking and engraving systems  laser micro machining systems  co lasers  optical scanners  high power solid state cw and q switched lasers  ultrafast lasers  high energy solid state pulsed lasers  precision optical components and light and color measurement instruments 
the laser and electro optical industry is subject to intense competition and rapid technological developments 
our strength and success is dependent upon us developing and delivering successful  timely and cost effective solutions to our customers 
the company believes  for it to maintain its performance  it must continue to increase its operational efficiencies  improve and refine its existing products  expand its product offerings and develop new applications for its technology 
the company s strategy is to grow internally and through acquisitions of complementary businesses 
historically the company has successfully integrated acquired companies into its existing operations 
details on our operations are discussed in our md a 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be relevant under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended 
sab requires that the following four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  the company receives a customer purchase order as evidence of an arrangement and product shipment terms are fob shipping point 
the company s revenues are generated from product sales  product upgrades and replacement part sales  maintenance agreements  and services 
the company s product lines principally consist of laser based systems and electro optical components used in a wide range of applications by different types of end users and are often used as sub assemblies required for end products manufactured by the customer 
revenue relating to these products is recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer  which is generally the shipment date  assuming the other criteria of sab are met 
if title and risk of loss do not pass to the customer until the product reaches the customer s delivery site  then recognition of revenue is deferred until that time 
related shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales and services 
with respect to maintenance agreements  revenue is recognized and customers are generally billed on a monthly or quarterly basis over the term of the agreement 
when a customer pays an annual maintenance fee  it is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement 
for services rendered  customers are billed and revenues are recognized as the related services are performed 
when a sales arrangement involves multiple elements  such as the sale of products that require installation  training or other services  the company records deferred revenue for the fair value of the undelivered element and recognizes the revenue when the revenue recognition criteria for that element is met 
fair value is established for an element based on the price when the element is sold separately 
the company has entered into contracts to design  develop and produce laser systems to customer specifications 
these contracts specify milestones and related progress billings and typically include terms that specify progress payments are non refundable or the customer may terminate the contract for convenience  at which time the company will be paid a percentage of the contract price that reflects the percentage of work performed to that date 
such contracts are accounted for in accordance with aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  whereby revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method with the extent of progress towards completion measured by the achievement of contractual milestones 
the company manufactures one product called a photomask defect repair system drs that is a laser based system for use in semiconductor photomask repair 
the drs provides a means to repair defects on the complex photomasks used to produce integrated circuits 
these are very large  highly complex machines  customized for each customer and ranging in price from million to million per unit based upon the most recent range of historical sales prices 
the terms of sale with respect to drs s require that the company perform installation due to the technical expertise required for this product 
due to the nature of the post shipment installation obligations with respect to the drs s  the company defers revenue recognition on the sale of drs s until installation has been completed 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company is required to estimate the collectibility of its trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the collectibility of accounts receivable is evaluated based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due  to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
for all other customers  management estimates an allowance for bad debts based upon the total accounts receivable balance and the percentage expected to be realized through subsequent cash collections 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced by a material amount 
inventories on a quarterly basis  the company compares the amount of inventory on hand and under commitment with its latest forecasted requirements and historical usage or sales to determine whether write downs for excess or obsolete inventory are required 
although the write downs for excess or obsolete inventory reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  and are considered adequate by the company s management  there can be no assurance that these write downs will prove to be adequate over time to cover ultimate losses in connection with the company s inventory 
in addition  the company will reduce the carrying value of its finished goods inventory to net realizable value  if the selling price of the product is less than its cost 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
as of december  and  the company has approximately million and million of net deferred tax liabilities  respectively  related principally to inventory basis differences and tax deductible goodwill amortization 
should future pretax book income and taxable income be considerably lower than projected  an increase to the valuation allowance may be required
