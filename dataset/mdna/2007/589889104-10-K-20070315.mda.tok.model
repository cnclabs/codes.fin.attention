in addition  we made two product acquisitions the honor hemostasis valve from millimed  and the futura safety scalpel from hypoguard 
the most significant product release of was the resolve locking catheter 
the resolve locking catheter offers higher gross margins than our existing corporate gross margins  and we expect this product will help to improve our sales growth 
we continued to see our gross margins decline during over the prior year 
in an effort to lower product costs  we moved the manufacturing of one of our product lines to mexico during and have identified two other product lines that we will move to mexico during the first half of during  the company will continue to review product lines that can be transferred to mexico or other low cost alternative sites in an effort to reduce product costs and improve our overall gross margins 
for the year ended december   we reported net sales of million  up million or over the comparable period in net sales growth in was primarily driven by increased sales of our stand alone products and our procedure tray business 
our gross margins as a percentage of sales were down to for the year ended december   compared to for year ended december  this decline resulted primarily from expenses incurred during the second half of for new facilities and related costs ie utilities  maintenance  cleaning and taxes and equipment

substantially all of the increase in our revenues was attributable to increased unit sales  except for a slight increase in revenues attributable to an increase in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar which increased sales by

the decline in gross margins in resulted primarily from new facilities and equipment  increased cost of direct labor  higher overhead expenses ie utilities  maintenance  cleaning and taxes and new product launches 
the decline in gross margins for was also affected by negative margins in the new procedure tray business we acquired from medsource during the fourth quarter of the effect was a reduction of gross margins by for sales of procedure trays contributed to our total sales for the slight decrease in gross margin percentage in  compared to  was primarily the result of a slight increase in the standard costs per unit as the result of increased manufacturing costs

under sfas no 
r  which we adopted effective january   we are required to apply the expense recognition provisions of this pronouncement to equity based incentives such as stock options 
in anticipation of this pronouncement  during and we made grants to management and employees for a total of  and  shares of our common stock  respectively  which vested immediately upon grant  rather than over five years as has been our historical practice 
additionally  subsequent to december   we accelerated the vesting on  options with an exercise price of  which was in excess of the current market price 
the immediate vesting of options and the acceleration of options which have exercise prices that are above the current market value of the common stock are anticipated to reduce our compensation expense by approximately million and million  respectively  over the next four years under the provisions of fas no 
r 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

under sfas no 
 we no longer amortize goodwill from business acquisitions  but review annually the impairment of goodwill  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we completed our initial testing of goodwill as of january  and determined that there was no impairment 
we have elected to perform our annual testing of goodwill impairment as of july of the applicable fiscal year 
as of july   we updated our testing of goodwill for impairment and determined that there was no impairment 
however  during the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was unlikely we would pursue the product associated with the intellectual property acquired from sub q due to other priorities and opportunities 
therefore  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately  in selling  general and administrative expense for  which included approximately  related to goodwill 
the remaining unamortized amount of goodwill at december   was approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources capital commitments the following table summarizes our capital commitments and contractual obligations as of december   including operating lease payments  and office lease payments  as well as the future periods in which such payments are currently anticipated to become due contractual obligations payment due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases royalty obligations total contractual cash obligations additional information regarding our capital commitments and contractual obligations  including royalty payments  is contained in notes   and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  set forth in item our working capital for   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in working capital for over was primarily the result of an increase in cash flow from operations of million and a reduction in the amount of capital expenditures made  when compared to the decrease in working capital for over was primarily the result of cash being used to fund the construction of our new facilities in south jordan  utah  and galway  ireland  the purchase and remodel of our facility in chester  virginia  and the acquisitions of mctec  medsource and sub q 
as of december   we had a current ratio of to we generated cash from operations for   and in the amount of million  million  and million respectively 
on december   we entered into an unsecured loan agreement with bank of america  na the bank  whereby the bank agreed to provide us a line of credit in the amount of  prior to december   the company maintained a long term revolving credit facility the facility with a zion s first national bank 
the facility had a credit limit of  for years and the facility expired on june  on december   we entered into an unsecured loan agreement with zion s first national bank the bank  whereby the bank agreed to provide us a line of credit in the amount of  we had outstanding under our lines of credit as of december  historically  we have incurred significant expenses in connection with product development and introduction of new products 
substantial capital has also been required to finance the increase in our receivables and inventories associated with our increased sales 
during  we spent approximately million for various production equipment  approximately million on building and leasehold improvements  and approximately million on the purchase of a piece of land in the netherlands to build a distribution facility 
during  we paid approximately million for payments to complete the construction of our new molding  technology and logistics mtl building and cafeteria expansion in south jordan  utah 
in addition  during  we spent approximately million to purchase a  square foot facility and add a clean room to our facility in chester  virginia  and approximately million to purchase seven acres of land just west of our current south jordan  utah facilities 
also during  we made significant investments were made for new equipment including approximately million in molding equipment  approximately million for an automated warehouse shipping system  and approximately million for automated production equipment 
our principal source of funding for these and other expenses has been cash generated from operations  sales of equity  cash from loans on equipment  and bank lines of credit 
we currently believe that our present sources of liquidity and capital are adequate for current operations and for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the sec has requested that all registrants address their most critical accounting policies 
the sec has indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the representation of the registrant s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results will differ  and may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates could occur in the future from period to period 
our management has discussed the development  and selection of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the following paragraphs identify our most critical accounting policies inventory obsolescence reserve our management reviews on a regular basis inventory quantities on hand for unmarketable and or slow moving products that may expire prior to being sold 
this review of inventory quantities for unmarketable and or slow moving products is based on estimates of forecasted product demand prior to expiration lives 
if market conditions become less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we believe that the amount included in our obsolescence reserve has been a historically accurate estimate of the unmarketable and or slow moving products that may expire prior to being sold 
our obsolescence reserve was approximately million as of december  allowance for doubtful accounts a majority of our receivables are with hospitals which  over our history  have demonstrated favorable collection rates 
therefore  we have experienced relatively minimal bad debts from hospital customers 
in limited circumstances we have written off minimal bad debts as the result of the termination of foreign distributors 
the most significant write offs over our history have come from us packers who bundle our products in surgical trays 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is based upon historical experience and a review of individual customer balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our bad debt reserve was  at december   which is in line with historical collection experience 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires that the fair value compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized over the employee s requisite service period 
the fair value of our stock options is estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
our employee stock purchase plan espp has a discount based on the date of distribution and under the guidelines of sfas no 
r the espp does not require a compensation cost to be recorded 
we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  stock based compensation cost is recognized beginning january  for all options granted after the date of adoption as well as the unvested portion of previously granted options based on the estimated fair value 
prior to january  we accounted for employee stock option grants and espp purchases using the intrinsic method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and accordingly associated compensation expense  if any  was measured as the excess of the underlying stock price over the exercise price on the date of grant 
we also complied with the disclosure option of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  and sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure and made pro forma footnote disclosures 
pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements were estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
for the twelve month period ended december   the adoption of sfas no 
r resulted in incremental stock based compensation expense of   in cost of goods sold   in research and development and  in selling  general and administrative expense 
we recognize stock based compensation expense net of a forfeiture rate for those awards which are expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we estimated the forfeiture rate based on our historical experience and expectations about future forfeitures 
income taxes 
management calculates its income tax provision  both current and deferred  based upon various complex estimates and interpretations of income tax laws and regulations in the various countries in which we do business 
in our opinion  we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  we can make no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which we make such determination 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our principal market risk relates to changes in the value of the euro and great britain pound gbp relative to the value of the us dollar 
our consolidated financial statements are denominated in  and our principal currency is  the us dollar 
a portion of our revenues million  representing approximately of aggregate revenues  for the year ended december  was attributable to sales that were denominated in euros and gbps 
certain of our expenses are also denominated in euros and gbps  which partially offsets risks associated with fluctuations of exchanges rates between the euro and gbp on the one hand  and the us dollar on the other hand 
because of our euro and gbp denominated revenues and expenses  in a year in which our euro and gbp denominated revenues exceed our euro and gbp based expenses  the value of such euro and gbp denominated net income increases if the value of the euro and gbp increase relative to the value of the us dollar  and decreases if the value of the euro and gbp decrease relative to the value of the u 
s 
dollar 
during the years ended december   the exchange rate between the euro and gbp against the us dollar resulted in an increase of our gross revenues of approximately  and in gross profit 
at december   we had a net exposure representing the difference between euro and gbp denominated receivables and euro and gbp denominated payables of approximately  and  respectively 
in order to partially offset such risks  on november   we entered into day forward contract for euro and gbp 
we generally enter into similar economic transactions at various times during the year to partially offset exchange rate risks we bear throughout the year 
we do not purchase or hold derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
during the year ended december  and we experienced a net loss of approximately  and  respectively  on these transactions executed during and in an effort to limit our exposure to fluctuations in the euro and gbp against the us dollar exchange rate 
another market risk relates to variable rate debt 
as of december   we had no variable rate debt 
as long as we do not have variable rate debt  our interest expense would not be affected by changes in interest rates
