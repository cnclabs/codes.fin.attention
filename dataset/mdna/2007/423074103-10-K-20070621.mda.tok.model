item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview fiscal the hj heinz company has been a pioneer in the food industry for years and possesses one of the world s best and most recognizable brands heinz 
while the company has prospered for a long time  we are constantly finding new ways to capitalize on emerging consumer trends and better methods of doing business 
over the past several years  we have been making great progress in simplifying and focusing the company on three core businesses 
this strategic transformation began with the spin off of our non core us businesses in december  and was completed in fiscal with the sales of our european seafood and new zealand poultry businesses 
on june   the company presented its superior value and growth plan for fiscal years and under this plan  the company set forth three key operational imperatives grow the core portfolio  reduce costs to drive margins and generate cash to deliver superior value 
under each of these imperatives  the company set financial and operational targets  aimed at increasing shareholder value 
the company achieved its targets for fiscal and is well positioned for continued growth in fiscal specifically net sales grew over to billion 
operating income grew  excluding special items in the prior year  including an incremental million or in consumer marketing investment see table in fiscal transformation costs which reconciles fiscal reported amounts to amounts excluding special items 
operating free cash flow cash flow from operations of  million less capital expenditures of million plus proceeds from disposals of pp e of million grew to million 
eps grew to  an increase of excluding prior year special items 
the following is a detailed update on the company s progress against the three imperatives under our superior value and growth plan at the end of fiscal as well as a summary of our expectations under these imperatives for fiscal grow the core portfolio this imperative is focused on a strategy to grow our largest brands in our three core categories 
this strategy established targets for increased marketing spending of million and double digit increases in research and development costs r d 
in addition  this strategy also focused on growth in various emerging markets  where growth potential was viewed as high 
during fiscal  we made excellent progress against this imperative as evidenced by the following our top brands  which generate nearly of total sales  grew we launched more than new products supported by a increase in marketing 
r d increased nearly as we increased capabilities in the areas of innovation and consumer insight 
innovation in our emerging markets drove strong growth  with a sales increase of in our ricip markets russia  india  china  indonesia and poland and latin america 
these markets accounted for approximately of sales and of the company s total sales growth in fiscal looking forward to fiscal  the company s innovation pipeline contains over consumer validated new products across our markets 
the company is planning incremental improvements in the health and wellness profile of its products in fiscal as well as convenience products like 
table of contents portable hand held snacks under the smart ones brand and microwavable soups in the uk  australia and new zealand 
the company plans to support new products introduced in fiscal with an additional to million of incremental marketing spending  completing a two year increase of around million 
the company will continue to invest for growth in our emerging ricip and latin american markets  which we expect to continue delivering double digit growth in fiscal by the end of fiscal  we expect these markets to reach billion in sales 
reduce costs to drive margins the company s investment in growth behind the core portfolio has been fueled by the second pillar of our two year plan  reducing costs to drive margins 
key targets set under this imperative included productivity improvements on deals and allowances d a  cost of goods sold cogs and selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
the following summarizes our progress in fiscal relative to this imperative d a as a percentage of gross sales was reduced by basis points  slightly ahead of our original target 
cogs was reduced by basis points as a percentage of sales  excluding prior year special items  and total gross profit exceeded target expectations 
the company divested or closed plants around the globe  one more than our original goal for the year 
as a result of productivity gains and  despite increasing consumer marketing by basis points as a percentage of sales  operating income margin increased by basis points  excluding prior year special items 
in fiscal  the company will continue to invest in improved business systems in order to boost the efficiency of its promotional programs  particularly in europe 
we expect further decreases in trade spending with a goal of reducing it by basis points as a percentage of gross sales over the two year plan 
trade promotion reductions and other productivity measures coupled with strategic pricing are expected to drive gross margin expansion 
a global supply chain task force has been established with the goal of further driving cost reductions  primarily in cogs 
we expect additional sg a savings in fiscal aided by headcount reductions  pension savings and more efficient indirect procurement 
the company s total anticipated productivity is now million over two years  which exceeds its previous estimates 
generate cash to deliver superior value heinz s growth  cost savings and working capital productivity drove operating free cash flow of million  or almost of revenue 
this was ahead of the goal for the year and better than the prior year 
much of this increased cash flow has been returned directly to shareholders  as evidenced by the following increase in the company s dividend in fiscal by  to a payout ratio of close to 
decrease in average shares outstanding by  resulting from net share repurchases in fiscal of million 
total shareholder return in fiscal of almost 
after tax return on invested capital roic improved basis points to 
in fiscal  we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow 
based on this confidence  the board of directors increased the dividend for fiscal by  for an annual indicative rate of per share 
we expect to return approximately of our earnings to our shareholders in the 
table of contents form of dividends 
we also expect to return an additional million to shareholders through net share repurchases in fiscal results of continuing operations the company s revenues are generated via the sale of products in the following categories fiscal year ended may  may  april  weeks weeks weeks dollars in thousands ketchup and sauces meals and snacks infant foods other total fiscal years ended may  and may  sales for fiscal increased million  or  to billion
