item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate two types of businesses funeral homes  which account for approximately of our revenues  and cemeteries  which account for approximately of our revenues 
funeral homes are principally a service business that provide funeral services burial and cremation and sell related merchandise  such as caskets and urns 
cemeteries are primarily a sales business that sells interment rights grave sites and mausoleums and related merchandise such as markers and memorials 
as of december   we operated funeral homes in states and cemeteries in states within the united states 
substantially all administrative activities are conducted in our home office in houston  texas 
factors affecting our funeral operating results include demographic trends in terms of population growth and average age  which impact death rates and number of deaths  establishing and maintaining leading market share positions supported by strong local heritage and relationships  effectively responding to increasing cremation trends by packaging complementary services and merchandise  controlling salary and merchandise costs  and exercising pricing leverage related to our at need business to increase average revenues per contract 
in simple terms  volume and price are the two variables that affect funeral revenues 
the average revenue per contract is influenced by the mix of traditional and cremation services because our average cremation service revenue is approximately of the average revenue earned from a traditional burial service 
funeral homes have a relatively fixed cost structure 
thus small changes in revenues  up or down  normally cause significant changes to our profitability 
we have implemented several significant long term initiatives in our operations designed to improve operating and financial results by growing market share and increasing profitability 
we introduced a more decentralized  entrepreneurial and local operating model that included operating and financial standards developed from our best operations  along with an incentive compensation plan to reward business managers for successfully meeting or exceeding the standards 
the model essentially eliminated the use of financial budgets 
the operating model and standards  which we refer to as being the best  focus on the key drivers of a successful operation  organized around three primary areas market share  people and operating and financial metrics 
the model and standards are the measures by which we judge the success of each business 
to date  the being the best operating model and standards have driven significant changes in our organization  leadership and operating practices 
in certain businesses we have determined that the business managers do not possess the characteristics to succeed in this type of culture  and we have been actively recruiting new managers who do 
we have also determined that this model is most effective in larger businesses 
being the best is not something that occurs easily and quickly  but we believe execution of the model should result in improving performance in and beyond 
the cemetery operating results are affected by the size and success of our sales organization because approximately of our cemetery revenues for the year ended december  relate to sales of grave sites and mausoleums and related merchandise and services before the time of need 
we believe that changes in the level of consumer confidence a measure of whether consumers will spend for discretionary items also affect the amount of cemetery revenues 
approximately of our cemetery revenues for the year ended december  are attributable to investment earnings on trust funds and finance charges on installment contracts 
changes in the capital markets and interest rates affect this component of our cemetery revenues 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  realization of accounts receivable  intangible assets  property and equipment and deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  third party data and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these considerations form the basis for making judgments about the amount and timing of revenues and expenses  the carrying value of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change 
historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance  because there can be no assurance the margins  operating income and net earnings as a percentage of revenues will be consistent from year to year 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements presented herewith  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents funeral and cemetery operations we record the sales of funeral and cemetery merchandise and services when the merchandise is delivered or service is performed 
sales of cemetery interment rights are recorded as revenue in accordance with the retail land sales provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
this method generally provides for the recognition of revenue in the period in which the customer s cumulative payments exceed of the contract price related to the real estate 
costs related to the sales of interment rights  which include property and other costs related to cemetery development activities  are charged to operations using the specific identification method in the period in which the sale of the interment right is recognized as revenue 
revenues to be recognized from the delivery of merchandise and performance of services related to contracts that were acquired in acquisitions are typically lower than those originated by the company 
allowances for bad debts and customer cancellations refunds and bad debts are provided at the date that sale is recognized as revenue 
in addition  we monitor changes in delinquency rates and provide additional bad debt and cancellation reserves when warranted 
when preneed funeral services and merchandise are funded through third party insurance policies  we earn a commission on the sale of the policies 
insurance commissions are recognized as revenues when the commission is no longer subject to refund  which is usually one year after the policy is issued 
preneed selling costs consist of sales commissions and other direct related costs of originating preneed sales contracts 
prior to  these costs were deferred and amortized into funeral and cemetery costs and expenses over the period we expect to perform the services or deliver the merchandise covered by the preneed contracts 
the periods over which the costs were recognized were based on actuarial statistics for the actual contracts we hold  provided by a third party administrator 
beginning in  we changed our method of accounting for preneed selling costs 
preneed selling costs are now expensed as incurred 
the cumulative impact of the change was a charge in the amount of million  net of tax  equal to per diluted share 
see the following section  accounting method change  and note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired  as determined by management in transactions accounted for as purchases  is recorded as goodwill 
many of the acquired funeral homes have provided high quality service to families for generations 
the resulting loyalty often represents a substantial portion of the value of a funeral business 
goodwill is typically not associated with or recorded for the cemetery businesses 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we review the carrying value of goodwill at least annually on reporting units aggregated geographically to determine if facts and circumstances exist which would suggest that this intangible asset might be carried in excess of fair value 
fair value is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the businesses in each reporting unit at the company s weighted average cost of capital less debt allocable to the reporting unit and by reference to recent sales transactions of similar businesses 
the calculation of fair value can vary dramatically with changes in estimates of the number of future services performed  inflation in costs  and the company s cost of capital  which is impacted by long term interest rates 
if impairment is indicated  then an adjustment will be made to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill to fair value 
income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated us federal income tax return and separate income tax returns in the states in which we operate 
we record deferred taxes for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities  in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain 
management reviews the valuation allowance at the end of each quarter and makes adjustments if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
stock compensation plans the company has stock based employee compensation plans in the form of restricted stock  stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
beginning january   the company accounts for stock based compensation under statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment fas no 
r 
fas no 
r requires companies to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the share based payment issued to employees over the period of vesting 
the fair value of share based payment is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
fas no 
r applies to all transactions involving issuance of equity by a company in exchange for goods and services  including employee services 
the company adopted fas no 
r in the first quarter of  using the modified prospective application method  which results in no restatement of the company s previously issued annual consolidated financial statements

these shares are valued at the dates granted and the value is charged to operations as the shares vest 
preneed funeral and cemetery trust funds the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 as revised  fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
this interpretation clarifies the circumstances in which certain entities that do not have equity investors with a controlling financial interest must be consolidated by its sponsor 
the company implemented fin r as of march   which resulted  for financial reporting purposes  in the consolidation of the company s preneed and perpetual care trust funds 
the investments of such trust funds have been reported at market value and the company s future obligations to deliver merchandise and services have been reported at estimated settlement amounts 
the company has also recognized the non controlling financial interests of third parties in the trust funds 
there was no cumulative effect of an accounting change recognized by the company as a result of the implementation of fin r 
the implementation of fin r affected certain accounts on the company s balance sheet beginning march  as described below  however  it did not affect cash flow  net income or the manner in which we recognize and report revenues 
although fin r requires consolidation of preneed and perpetual care trusts  it did not change the legal relationships among the trusts  the company and its customers 
in the case of preneed trusts  the customers are the principal beneficiaries 
in the case of perpetual care trusts  the company does not have a right to access the corpus in the perpetual care trusts 
for these reasons  the company has recognized non controlling interests in our financial statements to reflect third party interests in these consolidated trust funds 
both the preneed trusts and the cemetery perpetual care trusts hold investments in marketable securities which have been classified as available for sale 
the investments are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses allocated to non controlling interests in trust investment in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
unrealized gains and losses attributable to the company  but that have not been earned through the performance of services or delivery of merchandise  are allocated to deferred revenues 
also  in connection with the implementation of fin r  the company began recognizing the income  gains and losses of the preneed trusts and the unrealized income  gains and losses of the cemetery perpetual care trusts 
the company recognizes a corresponding expense equal to the recognized earnings of these trusts attributable to the non controlling interest holders 
when such earnings attributable to the company have not been earned through the performance of services or delivery of merchandise  the company will record such earnings as deferred revenue 
for preneed trusts  the company recognizes as revenues amounts attributed to the non controlling interest holders and the company  including accumulated earnings  when the contracted services have been performed and merchandise delivered 
for cemetery perpetual care trusts  the company recognizes investment earnings in cemetery revenues when such earnings are realized and distributable 
such earnings are intended to defray cemetery maintenance costs incurred by the company 
discontinued operations in accordance with the company s strategic portfolio policy  smaller  lower margin  non strategic businesses are reviewed to determine whether the businesses should be sold and the proceeds redeployed elsewhere 
a marketing plan is then developed for those locations which are identified as held for sale 
when the company receives a letter of intent and financing commitment from the buyer and the sale is expected to occur within one year  the location is no longer reported within the company s continuing operations 
the assets and liabilities associated with the held for sale location are reclassified on the balance sheet and the operating results  as well as impairments  are presented on a comparative basis in the discontinued operations section of the consolidated statements of operations  along with the income tax effect

 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized  measured  and derecognized in financial statements  requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters  specifies how reserves for uncertain tax position should be classified on the balance sheet  and provides transition and interim period guidance  among other provisions 
fin is effective for years after december  and will be adopted by the company in the first quarter of the company has reviewed its income tax positions and identified certain tax deductions related to business acquisitions that are not certain 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin will be recorded in retained earnings and other balance sheet accounts  as applicable 
the company has not determined the effect that the adoption of fin will have on our financial position and results of operations 
should penalties and interest be recorded in connection with the company s tax position  they will be recognized as income tax expense 
because the company presently has net operating losses available to offset taxable income  no penalties or interest are recorded in connection with the adoption of fin fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements

will have on its consolidated financial statements 
consideration of misstatements in september  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab  which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
the provisions of sab is effective for financial statements as of the beginning of the first fiscal year ending after november  the company adopted the requirements at november  the impact of sab in the future will depend on the nature and extent of any prior year misstatements  but we do not anticipate sab will have any impact to our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is typically exposed to a variety of market risks 
currently  these are primarily related to changes in interest rates related to outstanding debts  decreases in interest rates related to the company s short term investments and changes in the values of securities associated with the preneed and perpetual care trusts

the company is not exposed to any other significant market risks including commodity price risk  nor foreign currency exchange risk 
the company monitors current and forecasted interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business and seeks to maintain optimal financial flexibility  quality and solvency 
as of december   the company s debt is comprised of fixed rate obligations 

table of contents the company does not currently have any floating rate long term borrowings outstanding under its million floating rate line of credit 
if the company borrows against the line of credit  any change in the floating rate would cause a change in interest expense 
the senior notes were issued to the public at par and are carried at a cost of million 
at december   these securities were typically trading at prices ranging from to the convertible junior subordinated debenture payable to carriage services capital trust pay interest at the fixed rate of and are carried on the company s balance sheet at a cost of approximately million 
the estimated fair value of these securities is estimated to be million and million at december  and  respectively  based on available broker quotes of the corresponding preferred securities issued by the trust 
increases in market interest rates may cause the value of these instruments to decrease but such changes will not affect the company s interest costs 
the remainder of the company s long term debt and leases consist of non interest bearing notes and fixed rate instruments that do not trade in a market  nor otherwise have a quoted market value 
any increase in market interest rates causes the fair value of those liabilities to decrease 
securities subject to market risk consist of investments held by the company s preneed funeral  cemetery merchandise and services and perpetual care trust funds 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for the estimated fair values of those securities
