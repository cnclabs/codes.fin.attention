basis of presentation financial statements for all periods presented in this report are prepared on a consolidated basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied 
all per share information is presented on a diluted basis unless otherwise noted 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior years financial information to conform to current year presentation 
on october   we completed the sale of most of our protective and flexible packaging businesses to pregis corporation 
these businesses historically were included in our protective and flexible packaging segment 
in conjunction with the sale of these entities  we reviewed our reporting segments in concert with requirements of the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
as a result  we elected to include the retained portions of the protective and flexible packaging businesses in our foodservice food packaging segment 
we have three reporting segments consumer products manufactures disposable plastic  foam  molded fiber  pressed paperboard  and aluminum packaging products  and sells them to customers such as grocery stores  mass merchandisers  and discount chains 
products include waste bags  food storage bags  and disposable tableware and cookware 
we sell many of our consumer products under well known trademarks  such as hefty r 
foodservice food packaging manufactures foam  clear plastic  aluminum  pressed paperboard  and molded fiber packaging products  and sells them to customers in the food distribution channel  who prepare and process food for consumption 
customers include foodservice distributors  restaurants  and other institutional foodservice outlets  food processors  and grocery chains 
other relates to corporate and administrative service operations and retiree benefit income and expense 
the accounting policies of the reporting segments are the same as those for pactiv as a whole 
where discrete financial information is not available by segment  reasonable allocations of expenses and assets liabilities are used 
executive overview business our primary business involves the manufacture and sale of consumer and specialty packaging products for the consumer and foodservice food packaging markets 
we operate manufacturing facilities in countries 
consumer products include plastic  aluminum  and paper based products  such as waste bags  food storage bags  and disposable tableware and cookware 
these products are sold under such well known brand names as hefty r  baggies r  hefty r onezip r  hefty r cinch sak r  hefty r the gripper r  hefty r zoo pals r  kordite r  ez foil tm  and hefty r serve n store r 
foodservice and food packaging products include foam  clear plastic  aluminum  pressed paperboard  and molded fiber packaging for customers in the food distribution channel 
customers include wholesalers  supermarkets  restaurants  and packer processors  who prepare and process food for consumption 
we sell our products to a wide array of customers worldwide 
customers include grocery stores  mass merchandisers  discount chains  restaurants  distributors  and fabricators 
costs incurred in connection with the manufacture and sale of these products are recorded in either cost of sales or selling  general  and administrative expenses 
greater than of our sales come from products made from different types of plastic resins  principally polystyrene and polyethylene  and to a lesser extent polypropylene and amorphous polyethylene terephthalate apet 
we have pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees 
in addition  in conjunction with our spin off from tenneco inc tenneco in  we became the sponsor of retirement plans covering participating employees of certain former subsidiaries and affiliates of tenneco 
with the exception of pension service costs associated with our production operations  we record pension income as an offset to selling  general  and administrative expenses 
however  when assessing our performance and returns  we typically exclude the effect of pension income and pension assets and liabilities 
significant trends  opportunities  and challenges several opportunities and challenges may influence our continued growth 
near term risks include the impact of energy cost volatility on resin costs the ability to increase selling prices the continued effectiveness of our productivity and procurement initiatives longer term risks include potential changes in consumer demand possible supplier and customer consolidations potential increases in foreign based competition possible growth in market share of unbranded products we expect to continue to be successful by adjusting selling prices to offset resin price movements implementing aggressive cost management and productivity programs leveraging our existing products into new distribution channels introducing innovative new products making strategic acquisitions the primary raw materials used to manufacture our products are plastic resins  principally polystyrene and polyethylene 
while average industry prices for polystyrene were slightly lower for the full year compared with  they began to rise at the end of  driven principally by higher benzene costs 
in  average industry prices for polyethylene rose approximately  compared with  driven by greater demand and higher ethylene prices 
however  in the fourth quarter of  polyethylene costs began to decline 
over the past three years  we were able to raise selling prices in many areas of our business to mitigate the effect of resin cost increases 
it is likely that resin costs will continue to be a source of uncertainty for us 
we continue to closely monitor the resin marketplace in order to respond quickly to any raw material cost increases 
our business is sensitive to other energy related cost movements  particularly those that affect transportation  logistics  and utility costs 
historically  we have been able to mitigate the effect of higher energy related costs with productivity improvements and other cost reductions 
however  if energy related costs increase significantly in the future  we may not be able to fully offset such increases with productivity gains 
in  we began to introduce lean principles and tools in many of our operating facilities 
we are expanding the use of lean principles to help us accelerate productivity improvements by reducing inventory and scrap levels  providing rapid stock replenishment  shortening scheduling cycles  improving our one stop shopping service  eliminating nonvalue added activities  and streamlining processes 
we expect our ability to use these tools throughout the organization will positively affect our operating results over the next several years

liquidity and off balance sheet financing we use various sources of funding to manage liquidity 
sources of liquidity include cash flow from operations and a year revolving credit facility of million 
no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december  we were in full compliance with the financial and other covenants of our revolving credit agreement at year end we also use an asset securitization program as off balance sheet financing 
no amounts were securitized under this program as of december   or december  we have pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees 
funding of the qualified us pension plan is currently determined by requirements of the employee retirement income security act  under which we were not required to make contributions to the plan in on august   president bush signed the pension protection act of ppa into law 
the ppa  which is effective for plan years beginning after december   significantly alters current funding requirements 
based on our current assumptions and requirements of the ppa  we do not anticipate that after tax contributions to the plan will be significant for the foreseeable future 
we believe that cash flow from operations  available cash reserves  and the ability to obtain cash under our credit facilities and asset securitization program will be sufficient to meet current and future liquidity and capital requirements 
year compared with results of continuing operations in the first quarter of  we announced a restructuring program to reduce manufacturing capacity and overhead costs and to reinvest a portion of the related savings in strategic growth initiatives 
implementation of the program resulted in the elimination of approximately salaried and hourly positions worldwide

we believe focusing on operating income excluding the effect of restructuring and other charges is a meaningful alternative way of evaluating our operating results 
the restructuring and other charges relate to actions that will have an ongoing effect on our company 
considering such charges as being applicable to and only could make our operating performance in those periods more difficult to evaluate when compared with other periods in which there were no such charges 
we use operating income excluding restructuring and other charges to evaluate operating performance

sfas no 
also requires that additional disclosures be provided in the notes to the financial statements regarding the impact on net periodic benefit costs of delaying the recognition of gains or losses  prior service costs or credits  and transition assets or obligations 
these changes are effective for fiscal years ending after december  in addition  effective for fiscal years beginning after december   sfas no

on december  we recorded a charge to other comprehensive income of million upon adoption 
critical accounting policies following are our accounting policies that involve the exercise of considerable judgment and the use of estimates 
these have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize sales when the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which generally occurs as products are shipped 
in arriving at net sales  we estimate the amount of deductions from sales that are likely to be earned or taken by customers in conjunction with incentive programs 
these include volume rebates  early payment discounts  and coupon redemptions 
estimates are based on historical trends and are reviewed quarterly for possible revision 
the amount of sales deductions reflected in net sales for the months ended december   are reasonable 
in the event that future sales deduction trends vary significantly from past or expected trends  reported sales may increase or decrease by a material amount 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
a portion of inventories and at december   and  respectively is valued using the last in  first out lifo method of accounting 
given the volatility of our costs of raw materials primarily plastic resins  we prefer the lifo method because it reflects the current cost of inventories in cost of sales 
if we had valued inventories using the first in  first out fifo accounting method as of january   net income would have been million  or per share  higher in  million  or per share  higher in  and million  or per share  higher in we periodically review inventory balances to identify slow moving and or obsolete items 
this determination is based on a number of factors  including new product introductions  changes in consumer demand patterns  and historical usage trends 
pension plans in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
see changes in accounting principles on page for additional information 
pretax pension plan income was million in  million in  and million in with the exception of pension service costs associated with our production operations  pension income is included in the statement of income as an offset to selling  general  and administrative expenses 
we estimate that our noncash pretax pension income will increase to million in projections of pension income are based on a number of factors  including estimates of future returns on pension plan assets  assumptions pertaining to the amortization of actuarial gains losses  expectations regarding employee compensation  and assumptions related to participant turnover  retirement age  and life expectancy 
in developing our assumption regarding the rate of return on pension plan assets  we estimate future returns on various classes of assets  risk free rates of return  and long term inflation rates 
since inception in  our us qualified pension plan s annual rate of return on assets has averaged 
historically  the plan has invested approximately of its assets in equity securities and in fixed income investments 
after considering all of these factors  we concluded that the use of a rate of return on assets assumption was appropriate for holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percentage point change in the rate of return on assets assumption would impact our pretax pension income by approximately million 
the discount rate assumption for our us plan is based on the composite yield on a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds constructed with durations to match the plan s future benefit obligations 
in this connection  the discount rate assumption for our us plan at our september measurement date was for and for holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percentage point change in the discount rate would impact our pretax pension income by approximately million 
we use a market related method for calculating the value of plan assets 
this method recognizes the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets over a year period 
resulting unrecognized gains or losses  along with other actuarial gains and losses  are amortized using the corridor approach outlined in sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
derivative financial instruments we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
to manage these risks we may enter into various hedging contracts in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we do not use hedging instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any transactions involving leveraged derivatives 
commodity derivatives during the fourth quarter of  we entered into natural gas commodity purchase agreements with third parties  hedging a portion of anticipated first quarter purchases of natural gas used in the production process at certain of our plants 
these purchase agreements are marked to market  with the resulting gains or losses recognized in earnings when hedged transactions are recorded 
the mark to market adjustments at december   were not material 
interest rates at december   we had public debt securities of million outstanding  with fixed interest rates and maturity dates ranging from months to years 
should we decide to redeem these securities prior to their stated maturity  we would incur costs based on the fair value of the securities at that time
