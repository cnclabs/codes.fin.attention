item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth above under the caption business risk factors 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements for the year ended december  and the related notes appearing in part ii item of this report 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of drugs to treat major medical needs in the areas of neurological and inflammatory diseases 
our integrated capabilities in preclinical research and development  including medicinal chemistry  bioinformatics  molecular biology and pharmacology  enable us to identify and select drug candidates that meet stringent standards for development 
this approach has yielded multiple lead candidates in our preclinical programs for pain and inflammation 
our proprietary preclinical programs are focused on identifying antagonists of selected purinergic receptors as novel potential treatments for a broad spectrum of pain and inflammatory conditions 
in addition  we have entered into a collaboration with pfizer to discover and develop product candidates targeting the vanilloid receptor  vr  for the potential treatment of pain and other diseases and disorders  as well as a collaboration with genentech in the areas of nerve growth and anti angiogenesis 
our business strategy is to become an integrated biopharmaceutical company by creating a pipeline of potential first and best in class product candidates for major medical needs  primarily in the areas of neurological and inflammatory diseases 
we are pursuing this goal by investing strategically in our internal drug discovery activities and by applying our expertise to the identification and potential acquisition of external programs that are complementary to our own 
in october  we announced the results of a pivotal phase iii study saint ii of nxy  a novel free radical trapping neuroprotectant  in acute ischemic stroke that was conducted by our exclusive licensee  astrazeneca 
the saint ii study did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction on the primary endpoint of stroke related disability in patients treated with nxy  as assessed versus placebo using the modified rankin scale 
in addition  no statistically significant treatment benefit was seen with nxy on secondary endpoints measuring the drug candidate s effects on neurological impairment and the reduction of the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage when administered with the approved thrombolytic agent  rt pa 
the saint ii data showed that nxy was well tolerated and the mortality rate was comparable in the treatment and placebo groups 
after reviewing the data from this study  astrazeneca decided to discontinue development of nxy we have not incurred any asset impairment or additional liabilities associated with astrazeneca s decision to discontinued the development of nxy we intend to thoroughly evaluate potential future development options for nxy  but have no present plans to conduct further clinical trials with this drug candidate 
we have a limited history of operations 
since our inception we have generated all of our revenues from agreements with corporate partners 
during certain periods in and  we conducted one or more phase i and phase ii clinical trials with three product candidates that we subsequently discontinued based on our review of data generated in the studies 
each of these product candidates was obtained through a license agreement or acquisition from a third party 
in may  we entered into a collaborative research agreement and a license and royalty agreement with pfizer to research  develop and commercialize small molecule compounds that target the vanilloid receptor  vr the collaboration focuses on treatments for pain and other diseases and disorders 
under the agreements  we received an upfront license fee of million in july we have deferred the upfront license fee and are recognizing it as contract revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated research period of two years through 
table of contents june in addition to the upfront license fee  the pfizer collaboration also provides us with research funding in excess of million which is being recognized over the estimated research period 
pfizer has the option to extend the research period for up to two additional years from june subject to additional funding requirements 
additionally  upon the successful achievement of research  development and commercialization milestones for each product resulting from the collaboration  we will be eligible to receive milestone payments greater than million in aggregate 
in addition to milestone payments  we will be entitled to receive double digit royalties on net sales by pfizer upon commercialization of a product generated by the collaboration 
we began recognizing revenue under these agreements in the third quarter of for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  in contract revenue 
revenue recognized in included milestone revenue of million that we earned in connection with the progression of a product candidate from the vr collaboration into advanced preclinical studies 
in december  we entered into a collaborative research  development and license agreement with genentech for the discovery and development of drugs that inhibit pathological or tumor angiogenesis and promote nerve re growth following nervous system injury 
under the terms of the agreement  genentech paid us an upfront license and technology access fee of approximately million in january and made a million equity purchase concurrent with our initial public offering 
the upfront payment was deferred and recognized as contract revenue on a straight line basis over the research period  which ended in february while the research period has ended  the agreement with genentech remains in effect 
we are eligible to receive future milestones and royalty payments on therapeutic products emerging from the collaboration that are developed and commercialized by genentech 
in exchange  genentech obtained exclusive worldwide rights to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize protein based therapeutics and other drug compositions for the treatment of cancer and other diseases in which mechanisms underlying new blood vessel growth play a significant role 
unless genentech exercises certain rights and makes additional payments to us  we will have the right to develop and commercialize products arising from the collaboration that are specifically useful for the treatment of central and peripheral nervous system diseases and conditions 
we would be required to make royalty payments and  in certain cases  milestone payments to genentech on products that we develop and commercialize under the collaboration 
as of december   we have not incurred any such payments under the agreement with genentech 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations for more than the next months 
however  changes to our current operating plan may require us to consume our capital resources sooner than we expect 
we expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future as we expand our research and development programs  advance new product candidates into clinical development from our existing research  and acquire  license or otherwise invest in technology  product candidates and businesses that are complementary to our own 
revenues we do not expect to generate revenue from product sales or royalties in the foreseeable future 
we seek to generate revenue from a combination of research funding  product sales  upfront fees and milestone payments in connection with collaborative or strategic relationships  and royalties resulting from the license of our intellectual property 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of milestone payments we may receive from our collaborative or strategic relationships  as well as those we may receive upon the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
revenue 
table of contents derived from collaborative and strategic relationships helps us fund our operations and may increase in the future if we are successful in achieving milestones in our existing collaborations  licensing our technology and establishing new collaborations or strategic relationships 
if we are unsuccessful in these goals  our revenues will decline and we may be required to limit our research and development  clinical trial  manufacturing and marketing efforts 
research and development expenses our research and development r d expenses consist primarily of costs associated with research  preclinical development and clinical trials involving product opportunities in the areas of neurological and inflammatory diseases 
the expenses we incur in connection with our research  preclinical and clinical development consist primarily of employee compensation including non cash expenses for stock based compensation  supplies and materials  costs for consultants  contract research and clinical trials including non cash expenses for stock based compensation to non employees  license fees  facilities and overhead costs  funded r d at other companies and research institutions  manufacturing of drug supplies for our programs  and depreciation of equipment 
r d costs  including some upfront fees and milestones paid to collaborators  are expensed as incurred 
the timing of upfront fees and milestone payments in the future may cause variability in our future r d expenses 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred research and development expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
all of the research and development expense incurred in related to our preclinical r d programs 
the majority of research and development expense incurred in and relates to our preclinical r d programs and clinical development activities 
for the years ended december  and  we incurred million and million  respectively  in r d expense relating to our preclinical programs and million and million  respectively  in r d expense relating to clinical development activities 
during the years ended december  and  research and development expense decreased by million and million  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expense in the past two years primarily reflected our decisions to end two clinical development programs  both of which involved multiple phase ii clinical studies that were in progress during and the first two quarters of preclinical r d expense increased in from and as a result of our investments in preclinical activities in the areas of neurological and inflammatory diseases 
the increase in expense in is the result of adding key personnel in chemistry and pharmacology to support expansion of our preclinical programs  including our proprietary programs to identify antagonists of the purinergic receptors  px and px we also maintained our effort to identify and advance molecules within our collaboration with pfizer  and we invested in certain exploratory programs that represent future opportunities to further expand our internal pipeline 
our clinical development efforts during were focused exclusively on initiating and conducting multiple phase ii clinical trials with ren and ren we discontinued clinical development activities involving ren and ren during and  respectively 
our preclinical r d activities during 
table of contents included toxicology and efficacy studies of various development candidates in preclinical models of pain and inflammatory disease as well as formulation and manufacturing of drug supply for these studies 
the preclinical r d amount of million was expended primarily on employee costs  supplies and materials and infrastructure related to neurobiology  chemistry  cell biology and related functions associated with our earlier stage research programs 
development timelines and costs are difficult to estimate and may vary significantly for each product candidate and from quarter to quarter 
the process of seeking regulatory approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable regulations  requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  including non cash  stock based compensation  for employees in executive and operational functions  including finance  legal  human resources and business development 
other significant costs include facilities costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services  including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are generated by complex collaborative research and licensing arrangements 
revenues under such agreements may include upfront payments  research funding  milestone payments and royalties 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we evaluate whether the delivered element under these arrangements has value to our collaborative partner or licensee on a stand alone basis and whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered element exists 
arrangements with multiple deliverables that do not meet these criteria are treated as one unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
revenues from nonrefundable upfront technology license fees  for product candidates where we are providing continuing services related to product development  are deferred and recognized as revenues ratably over the estimated period of performance under the research agreement 
the performance period is estimated at the inception of the arrangement and is periodically reevaluated 
the reevaluation of the performance period may shorten or lengthen the period during which the deferred revenue is recognized  which would result in an acceleration or delay of expected revenue recognition 
research funding is recognized as revenue as the related effort is performed 
milestone payments we receive under collaborative arrangements are recognized as revenues upon achievement of the milestone events  which represent the culmination of the earnings process  and when collectability is reasonably assured 
milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to us  such as regulatory approval to market a product or the achievement of specified sales 
table of contents levels by a marketing partner or licensee 
accordingly  the milestone payments are substantially at risk at the inception of the contract  and the amounts of the payments assigned thereto are commensurate with the milestone achieved 
upon the achievement of a milestone event  we have no future performance obligations related to that milestone as the milestone payments we receive are nonrefundable 
stock compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions for sfas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
we have used the black scholes valuation model to estimate fair value of our stock based awards which requires various judgmental assumptions including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected life 
our computation of expected volatility is based on a combination of peer companies historical volatilities and our market based implied volatility 
in addition  we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures and expected life  including types of awards  employee class and historical experience 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january  our financial statements in reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective method  the financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
upon the adoption of sfas r in january  the deferred stock compensation balance of million was reclassified to additional paid in capital 
clinical study activities and other expenses from third party contract research organizations some of our research and development  including certain preclinical and clinical study activity  is conducted by various third parties  including contract research organizations  which may also provide contractually defined administration and management services 
we recognize expenses for these contracted activities based upon a variety of factors  including estimated and actual labor hours  actual and estimated patient enrollment rates  clinical site initiation activities and other activity based factors 
on a regular basis  our estimates of these costs are reconciled to actual invoices from the service providers  and adjustments are made accordingly 
results of operations comparison of the twelve months ended december   and revenue total revenue and dollar and percentage changes for each of the three years ending december  are as follows dollar amounts are in thousands pfizer collaboration genentech collaboration total revenue dollar increase percentage increase 
table of contents the increase in revenue in as compared to resulted from a collaborative research agreement and a license and royalty agreement with pfizer that we signed in may under the agreements with pfizer we received an upfront license fee of million in july we recorded the upfront license fee as deferred revenue and are recognizing it as contract revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated research period of two years 
in addition to the upfront license fee  the agreements with pfizer also provide the company with total research funding of more than million during the two year research period 
revenue recognized in included milestone revenue of million that we earned in connection with the progression of a product candidate from the vr collaboration into advanced preclinical studies 
revenue recognized under a collaborative agreement with genentech decreased in as compared to as the funded research period ended in february and all collaborative revenue was fully earned in the first quarter of the year over year increase in revenue in as compared to is mainly attributable to the collaborative research agreement and license and royalty agreement with pfizer that was executed in may we expect that any revenue we may earn will fluctuate from year over year as a result of the timing and amount of any milestone payments we earn or any new collaborations we may enter into in the future 
for the year ending december   we presently anticipate contract revenue from existing agreements of approximately million to million 
research and development expenses total research and development expenses and dollar and percentage changes for each of the three years ending december  are as follows dollar amounts are in thousands total r d expense dollar decrease percentage decrease specific changes in r d expense in as compared to are as follows clinical development costs  manufacturing costs of clinical trial supplies and costs of outside services decreased by million primarily due to our decisions to end two clinical development programs  amortization of intangible assets decreased to in from million as the underlying intangible assets were fully amortized as of the end of  expense related to equity instruments issued for consulting services decreased by million primarily due to certain noncash compensation charges recorded in that are not recurring in  employee compensation decreased by million primarily due to the termination of two clinical programs in  license fees decreased by million primarily due to lower costs incurred on administration of license agreements  non cash stock based compensation for options granted to employees increased by million primarily due to our accounting for employee stock based compensation under the fair value method in accordance with sfas r as of january  prior to january  we accounted for options granted to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb during the year ended december   we recorded million in expense in accordance with sfas r 
during year ended december   we recorded million in expense utilizing the intrinsic value method of measuring stock compensation in accordance with apb  costs of supplies and materials increased by million primarily due to increased pre clinical activities performed in house  and 
table of contents overhead expenses including employee training  depreciation of fixed assets and property tax increased by million primarily due to increases in underlying expenses 
specific changes in r d expense in as compared to are as follows external clinical trial costs  manufacturing cost of clinical trial supplies and other costs related to pharmacology and in vivo studies decreased by million primarily due to our decisions to end two clinical development programs and cancellations of certain other clinical projects  non cash stock based compensation for options granted to employees  accounted for under the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb  decreased by million  employee related expense increased by million due to increased headcount and increases in merit pay  partially offset by decreases in recruiting and relocation related expenses  and overhead expenses including information technology and building operating cost increased by million primarily due to increases in underlying expenses 
we expect r d expenses  excluding non cash stock based compensation and approximately million in restructuring expense that we will record in the first quarter of  to decrease in as a result of voluntary attrition and the effect of our restructuring in january general and administrative expenses total general and administrative g a expenses and dollar and percentage changes for each of the three years ending december  are as follows dollar amounts are in thousands total g a expense dollar increase percentage increase increases in g a expense in as compared to are as follows non cash stock based compensation for options granted to employees and non employee directors increased by million primarily due to our accounting for employee stock based compensation under the fair value method in accordance with sfas r as of january  during the year ended december   we recorded million in expense under the fair value method of measuring stock compensation in accordance with sfas r 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in expense utilizing the intrinsic value method of measuring stock compensation in accordance with apb  employee compensation increased by million primarily due to an increase in g a headcount  outside services increased by million primarily due to increased corporate development activities  overhead expenses including employee training  depreciation of fixed assets and property tax increased by million primarily due to increases in underlying expenses  and legal expense decreased by million primarily due to lower costs associated with intellectual property matters 
specific changes in g a expense in as compared to are as follows professional and consulting service expenses increased by million primarily due to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and for business development activities  and legal expenses decreased by million primarily due to lower costs associated with intellectual property matters 

table of contents we expect g a expenses  excluding non cash stock based compensation and approximately million in restructuring expense that we will record in the first quarter of  to decrease in as compared to following our restructuring in january interest income total interest income and dollar and percentage changes for each of the three years ending december  are as follows dollar amounts are in thousands total interest income dollar increase percentage increase the increase in interest income in and was primarily attributable to a higher rate of return on our investment portfolio and higher average investment balances due to our common stock offering in september  which resulted in net proceeds of million 
interest expense total interest expense and dollar and percentage changes for each of the three years ending december  are as follows dollar amounts are in thousands total interest expense dollar increase percentage increase the increase in interest expense in was primarily due to the higher aggregate debt balances and higher borrowing interest rates 
interest expense was nominally higher in than financial guidance for the year ending december   the company presently anticipates total contract revenue from existing agreements of approximately million to million  and total operating expenses of approximately million to million  excluding non cash  stock based compensation to be recognized in accordance with sfas r and approximately million in restructuring expense that we will record in the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities as well as through equipment and leasehold improvement financing 
as of december   we had received approximately million from the sale of equity securities 
in february  we received approximately million from our initial public offering of common stock and concurrent private placement with genentech 
in september  we completed a public offering of common stock under which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  since inception to december   we financed the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements with debt totaling approximately million  of which million was outstanding at december  the remaining obligations are secured by the purchased equipment and leasehold improvements  bear interest at rates ranging from approximately to and are due in monthly installments through september 
table of contents as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to million as of december   a decrease of million 
the decrease resulted primarily from cash used in operating activities  capital purchases and principal payments on outstanding debt related to capital purchases 
our cash and investments are invested in a diversified portfolio of financial instruments  including money market instruments  corporate notes and bonds  government or governmental agency securities and other debt securities issued by financial institutions and other issuers with strong credit ratings 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million decrease in cash used in operations in as compared to primarily reflected a decrease in net operating loss of million as a result of an increase in contract revenue of million  offset by an increase in operating expense of million 
the million decrease in cash used in operations in as compared to primarily reflected a decrease in net operating loss of million as a result of an increase in contract revenue of million and a decrease in operating expense of million 
in january we implemented a restructuring plan which resulted in the company reducing its workforce by approximately of its positions 
the intention of the restructuring is to reduce spending while maintaining the research and development capabilities needed to advance the company s late stage preclinical drug discovery program 
as a result of the restructuring and broader efforts to reduce spending on general and administrative activities  we expect operating expenses of approximately million to million  excluding non cash  stock based compensation expense to be recognized in accordance with sfas r and approximately million in restructuring expense that we will record in the first quarter of net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash used by investing activities of million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
these fluctuations resulted primarily from timing differences in the investment purchases  sales and maturities and the fluctuations in our portfolio mix between cash equivalents and short term investments 
we expect similar fluctuations to continue in the future 
capital equipment purchases for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
capital equipment purchases for are expected to be approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities in was higher than primarily due to the completion of a public offering of common stock under which we received net proceeds of approximately million in net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was higher than primarily due to our initial public offering and concurrent private placement with genentech in which we received million 
the following summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  dollar amounts are in thousands total thereafter operating leases equipment financing interest related to equipment financing total our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the progress of preclinical development and laboratory testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  
table of contents delays that may be caused by evolving requirements of regulatory agencies  the number of product candidates we pursue  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  our plans to establish or acquire sales  marketing and or manufacturing capabilities  our ability to establish  enforce and maintain selected strategic alliances and activities required for product commercialization  the acquisition of technologies  products and other business opportunities that require financial commitments  and our revenues  if any  from successful development and commercialization of our products 
based upon our current operating plan we believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of december  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for more than the next months 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources 
we will be required to seek additional sources of funding to complete development and commercialization of our products 
when we raise funds in the future  we may be required to raise those funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that such funding will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing will be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our inability to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy 
we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
in october  we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec to be able to sell from time to time up to million of any combination of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock and warrants 
the sec has not declared this registration statement effective and securities may not be sold  nor may offer to buy the securities be accepted  prior to the time this registration statement becomes effective 
the terms of any offering will be determined at the time of such offering 
in we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec to be able to sell from time to time up to million of any combination of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock and warrants 
the sec declared this registration statement effective in may in september  we sold  shares of common stock to the public under this registration statement at per share for gross proceeds of million 
as of december   million remains available under this registration statement 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal as of december   we have 
table of contents federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  and federal and state research and development credits of approximately million and million  respectively  that may be subject to annual limitation  due to certain substantial changes in ownership  under the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and credit carryforwards before utilization 
as of december   all of our deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance because the realization of these assets is dependent upon future earnings 
we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments
