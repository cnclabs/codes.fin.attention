item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the largest radio broadcasting companies in the united states based on revenues 
we operate in excess of radio stations in markets including san francisco  boston  seattle  denver  sacramento  portland  kansas city  indianapolis  milwaukee  austin  norfolk  buffalo  new orleans  providence  memphis  greensboro  rochester  greenville spartanburg  madison  wichita  wilkes barre scranton  springfield and gainesville ocala 
on january   we entered into an asset exchange agreement pursuant to which on february   we began operations in a new radio market  san francisco and exited an existing radio market  cincinnati 
a radio broadcasting company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of broadcasting time to local and national advertisers 
the advertising rates that a radio station is able to charge and the number of advertisements that can be broadcast largely determine those revenues 
advertising rates are primarily based on four factors a station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers as measured principally by periodic reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  both nationally and in the regions in which the station operates  and the market s size based upon available radio advertising revenue 
in  we generated of our net revenues from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each individual local radio station s sales staff  and from national advertising  which is sold by independent advertising sales representatives 
we generated the balance of our revenues principally from network compensation  promotional activities  sales on our stations websites and rental income from tower sites 
our most significant station operating expenses are employee compensation  and programming and promotional expenses 
several factors may adversely affect a radio broadcasting company s performance in any given period 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
as opportunities arise  we may  on a selective basis  change or modify a station s format due to changes in listeners tastes or changes in a competitor s format 
this could have an immediate negative impact on a station s ratings and or revenues  and there are no guarantees that the modification or change will be beneficial at some future time 
our management is continually focused on these opportunities as well as the risks and associated uncertainties 
we believe that the diversification of formats on our stations helps to insulate us from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public 
we strive to develop compelling content and strong brand images to maximize audience ratings that are crucial to our stations financial success 
our results of operations include net revenues and station operating expenses from stations we own and those net revenues and station operating expenses recognized under a time brokerage agreement or similar sales agreement for stations operated by us prior to acquiring the stations 
depending on the facts and circumstances relating to each pending asset purchase agreement eg  whether or not there is an associated time brokerage agreement or similar agreement and the provisions of financial interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 we may include the assets and liabilities  of the entity holding the assets to be acquired  in our consolidated balance sheet  and the net revenues and station operating expenses  of the entity holding the assets to be acquired  in our consolidated statement of operations and consolidated statement of cash flows 
more information on this interpretation by the financial accounting standards board fasb is described in note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following results of operations include a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  our results of operations represent the operations of the radio stations owned or operated pursuant to time brokerage agreements during the relevant periods 
we evaluate net revenues  station operating expenses and operating income by comparing the performance of stations owned or operated by us throughout a relevant year to the performance of those same stations in the prior year whether or not owned or operated by us 
included in the comparisons that follow under the heading same station considerations is summary information regarding significant contracts that relate to station operations  have a significant effect on the net revenues and or station operating expenses of a particular market  and we account for as separate business units 
we use these comparisons to assess the performance of our operations by analyzing the effect of acquisitions and dispositions of stations and changes in status of significant contracts on net revenues and station operating expenses throughout the periods measured 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following significant factors affected our results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year acquisitions on december   we purchased wkaf fm formerly wild fm in boston  massachusetts  which we began operating on august  under a time brokerage agreement by simulcasting the format of waaf fm another radio station owned and operated by us in this market  that in increased station operating expenses  on november   we began operating radio stations in austin  texas  cincinnati  ohio other than the radio station as described below that cumulus media partners  llc began operating on november  under a time brokerage agreement and memphis  tennessee  under a time brokerage agreement with cbs radio stations inc cbs  that in increased net revenues  station operating expenses and time brokerage agreement expense  on november   we began operating a radio station in cincinnati  ohio  under a time brokerage agreement with cumulus media partners  llc cumulus and  on the same date  cumulus began operating one of the radio stations in cincinnati  ohio that was included in the cbs time brokerage agreement described above  that in increased net revenues and station operating expenses  and on october   we acquired for million three radio stations in greenville  south carolina  which in increased our net revenues  station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  and interest expense 
dispositions on october   we sold for million three radio stations in greenville  south carolina  which in decreased our net revenues  station operating expense  depreciation and amortization and interest expense  on march   we sold for million four radio stations in longview  washington  that the buyer began operating on november  under a time brokerage agreement  which in decreased depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense  and on january   we sold for million a radio station in seattle  washington  that the buyer began operating on december  under a time brokerage agreement which in decreased depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense and  in  increased gains on sale of assets by million 
financing in  we paid quarterly cash dividends to our shareholders in the collective amount of million  which in increased our interest expense due to increased borrowings and increased borrowing costs under our senior credit facility to finance the payment of the dividends  and under our authorized share repurchase programs  we repurchased shares of our class a common stock in the amount of million in and in the amount of million in  which in increased our interest expense due to increased borrowings and increased borrowing costs under our senior credit facility to finance the repurchase of our stock 
other we reflected million in corporate general and administrative expenses related to a settlement with the nyag and a reserve for an investigation by the fcc into sponsorship identification practices at several media companies  on january   we adopted a new accounting standard which required the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan purchases based on estimated fair values  which in increased our station operating expenses and corporate general and administrative expenses  and net revenues december  december  dollars in millions net revenues amount of change percentage change contributing to our overall increase in net revenues was the commencement of certain radio station operations in the austin  memphis and cincinnati markets on november  under time brokerage agreements and the acquisition of three greenville radio stations in october this increase in net revenues was offset by decreases in net revenues for many radio stations  with the largest declines experienced in denver  indianapolis  milwaukee and norfolk 
same station considerations net revenues in would have been lower by million if we had adjusted net revenues to give effect to acquisitions and dispositions of radio stations as of january  net revenues in would have been higher by million if we had adjusted net revenues to give effect to acquisitions and dispositions of radio stations and significant contracts as of january  station operating expenses december  december  dollars in millions station operating expenses amount of change percentage change the increase of million in station operating expenses in was primarily due to the commencement of certain radio station operations in the austin  memphis and cincinnati markets on november  under time brokerage agreements  a correlating increase in station operating expenses associated with the net increase in net revenues as described under net revenues  the acquisition in october of three stations in our greenville market  and the effects of inflation

r  million from the write off of transaction costs during the first quarter of that were associated with an acquisition that did not materialize  and the effects of inflation 
non cash compensation expense increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to a change in our mix of equity awards issued during the second quarter of to our key employees by granting a combination of restricted stock units with service conditions and restricted stock units with service and market conditions  in lieu of stock options  and the adoption on january  of sfas no

operating income december  december  dollars in millions operating income amount of change percentage change the decrease in operating income of million was primarily due to an increase in station operating expenses of million for the reasons described above under station operating expenses  an increase in corporate general and administrative expenses of million  due to the reasons described above under corporate general and administrative expenses  a decrease in net gain on sale or disposal of assets of million due to a net loss on sale or disposal of assets of million for the year ended december  as compared to a net gain on sale or disposal of assets of million for the year ended december   primarily due to the sale in of a radio station in seattle that resulted in a gain on sale of assets of million  and an increase of million in time brokerage agreement fees in connection with the commencement of operations of stations in austin  cincinnati and memphis on november  under time brokerage agreements 
same station considerations operating income in would have been lower by million if we had adjusted operating income to give effect to acquisitions and dispositions of radio stations exclusive of depreciation and amortization expenses and time brokerage agreement fees

interest expense december  december  dollars in millions interest expense amount of change percentage change the increase in interest expense of million was primarily attributable to higher average outstanding debt under our senior credit agreement used to finance a the repurchase of our class a common stock in the amount of million for the year ended december  and million during the year ended december   under several stock repurchase programs  b quarterly dividend payments during the year ended december  in the aggregate of million  and c an acquisition net of a disposition in the amount of million in greenville during the fourth quarter of  and higher interest rates and higher borrowing costs as a result of increased borrowing of debt during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  income before income taxes december  december  dollars in millions income before income taxes amount of change percentage change the decrease in income before income taxes of million was mainly attributable to a decrease in operating income of million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   due to the factors described above under operating income  an increase in interest expense of million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   for the reasons described above under interest expense  and a decrease of million in gain on investments due to the sale of certain investments during the year ended december  income taxes december  december  dollars in millions income tax amount of change percentage change the decrease in income taxes of million is primarily a result of a decrease in income before income taxes 
income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was in as compared to in the increase in our effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the impact of limitations on deductibility for tax purposes of certain expenses associated with a reserve for an investigation by the fcc  the impact of limitations on deductibility for tax purposes of share based compensation for certain key employees  and an increase in our valuation allowances and contingencies 
this increase was partially offset by a changes in apportioned income to the states in which we operate  and b federal income tax credits from the effect of hurricane katrina 
for the year ended december   the current and deferred portions of our income tax expense were million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   the current and deferred portions of our income tax expense were million and million  respectively 
we estimate that our annual tax rate for  which may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  will not change materially from our tax rate in we estimate that our rate in will be affected primarily from i adding facilities in states that on average have higher income tax rates than states in which we currently operate and its effect on previously reported temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities  ii the effect of recording changes in our fin liabilities subsequent to adoption of fin on january   and iii the limitations on the deduction of certain non cash compensation expense for certain key employees 
our effective tax rate may also be materially impacted by changes in the level of income in any of our taxing jurisdictions  changes in our estimate of uncertain tax positions in accordance with our adoption on january  of fin  regulatory changes in certain states in which we operate  changes in the expected outcome of tax audits  changes in the estimate of expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes  and changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
our net non current deferred tax liabilities were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the deferred tax liability primarily relates to differences between book and tax bases of our fcc licenses 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we do not amortize our fcc licenses for financial statement purposes  but instead test them annually for impairment 
as our fcc licenses continue to amortize for tax purposes  our deferred tax liability will increase over time 
we do not expect the significant portion of our deferred tax liability to reverse over time unless our fcc licenses become impaired  or our fcc licenses are sold for cash  which would typically only occur in connection with the sale of the assets of a station or groups of stations or the entire company in a taxable transaction

most of our radio stations realized an improvement in net revenues  which was partially offset by declines in a few of our radio stations 
net revenue increases in were partially offset by our restructured agreement with the seattle seahawks  effective with the start of the national football league season  which eliminated our sale of advertising time and our production of the games  a reduction in political advertising in compared to  and early elimination in of the boston red sox from post season play with three post season games as compared to post season games in  that reduced the number of games available to sell advertising under our boston red sox agreement

liquidity and capital resources since we began our share repurchase initiative in may  we have used a significant portion of our capital resources to repurchase shares of our class a common stock see liquidity and capital resources share repurchase programs below 
generally  our acquisitions  share repurchases  reductions of our outstanding debt  dividends and other capital requirements are funded from one or a combination of the following sources our credit agreement  internally generated cash flow  the issuance and sale of securities  and the swapping of our radio stations in transactions which may qualify as like kind exchanges under section of the internal revenue code 
we have also used a portion of our capital resources to pay dividends in the aggregate amount of million during the year ended december  prior to the payment of our first quarterly dividend in march and since becoming a public company in january  we had not declared any dividends on any class of our common stock 
we expect to continue to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends 
any payment of dividends in the future  however  will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon  among other factors  financial condition  capital requirements  level of indebtedness  contractual restrictions  including the provisions of our senior and subordinated debt  and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant or are required to consider 
see note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for declaration dates and other pertinent information 
our bank revolver on december   we entered into a second amendment to our bank revolver with a syndicate of banks that primarily provided for a modification to one of the bank revolver s restrictive covenants that increased the maximum permitted total debt to operating cash flow  and an increase in the bank revolver to million from million 
on september   we entered into a first amendment to our bank revolver with a syndicate of banks that provided for the elimination of a restrictive covenant that would have required us to enter into certain interest rate transactions to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt 
on august   we entered into a bank credit agreement  or bank revolver  with a syndicate of banks  for a five year senior secured revolving credit facility of million 
the bank revolver is secured by a pledge of of the capital stock and other equity interest in all of our owned subsidiaries 
the bank revolver  as amended  requires us to comply with certain financial covenants and leverage ratios  which are defined terms within the agreement  including total debt to operating cash flow  operating cash flow to interest expense  and operating cash flow to fixed charges 
upon the occurrence of certain events  our interest rate can increase to a a maximum of the eurodollar rate plus  or  b the greater of prime rate plus or the federal funds rate plus 
the interest payable on the eurodollar rate is payable at the end of the selected duration 
we also pay a commitment fee that varies depending on certain financial covenants and the amount of the unused commitment  to a maximum of per annum  on the average unused balance of the bank revolver 
management believes we are in compliance with all financial covenants and leverage ratios and all other terms of the bank revolver 
closing on any pending transactions  as described below under liquidity  is conditioned on compliance under the bank revolver at the time of closing 
our senior subordinated notes on march   we issued million of senior subordinated notes the notes due march   and we received net proceeds of million 
interest on the notes  which are in denominations of  each  accrues at the rate of per annum and is payable semi annually in arrears on march and september we may redeem the notes on and after march  at an initial redemption price of of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
the notes are unsecured and rank junior to our senior indebtedness 
our senior subordinated notes also require us to comply with certain covenants that limit  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness and to make certain payments 
the covenants under the senior subordinated notes  in general  are less restrictive than the covenants under the bank revolver 
liquidity our liquidity requirements are for working capital and general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  and any one or more of the following repurchases of our class a common stock  dividends and acquisitions 
during the year ended december   we paid million in income taxes that primarily included certain estimated state taxes for this amount was significantly less than the amount paid for the year ended december  of million  as payments from the year ended december  in the amount of million were available to be used as prepayments against federal and certain state income taxes in in  we expect to benefit from the tax deductions for depreciation and amortization on assets to be acquired in under the pending transactions 
accordingly  these tax benefits will significantly reduce the amount of quarterly estimated federal and state income tax payments we expect to make in based upon projected quarterly taxable income 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were as compared to million in and million in we anticipate that capital expenditures in will consist of between million and million incurred during the ordinary course of business and for the conversion of our remaining fm stations to digital radio  and between million and million primarily for a the consolidation and or relocation of studio and office facilities in the markets in common with the stations to be acquired under pending transactions  and b the construction of new studio and office facilities in new orleans as a result of the forced relocation from the effects of hurricane katrina 
as of december   we had credit available of million under the bank revolver  subject to compliance with the covenants under the bank revolver at the time of borrowing 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
during the year ended december   we increased our net outstanding debt by million  primarily to help fund our repurchase of shares in the amount of million  to pay dividends of million to shareholders  and to acquire a radio station in boston  massachusetts  for million in december as of december   we had outstanding million in senior debt  including million under our bank revolver  million in a letter of credit  and million in senior subordinated notes 
due to the cash required for the closing on the pending transactions described below  we expect that in  our outstanding debt will increase and our available credit under our bank revolver will decrease 
we may seek to obtain other funding or additional financing from time to time 
we believe that cash on hand and cash from operating activities  together with available borrowings under the bank revolver  will be sufficient to permit us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future  including cash to fund our operations and any pending acquisitions  authorized repurchases of our stock and any declared dividends 
we intend to finance the pending acquisitions as described in the accompanying consolidated notes to the financial statements  primarily from available borrowings under the bank revolver 
our bank revolver requires that  at the time of closing on acquisitions  we must be in compliance with the terms of the bank revolver 
we believe that we will maintain compliance with the terms of our bank revolver 
if we are not in compliance  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in amending the bank revolver  in entering into a new credit agreement or in obtaining additional financing or that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us  which could delay or impair our efforts to consummate future acquisitions 
failure to comply with our financial covenants or other terms of the bank revolver could result in the acceleration of the maturity of our outstanding debt 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in was mainly attributable to a decrease in net income of million net of gain or loss on sale or disposal of assets and non cash stock based compensation expense to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   and an increase in working capital requirements of million that was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of the commencement of new station operations in several markets 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities to million for the year ended december  compared to a million decrease for the year ended december   primarily due to the recording of unfunded share repurchase obligations of million as of december  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an elimination from net income of a gain on dispositions and exchanges of assets of million for the year ended december   primarily from the disposition of a station in seattle  an elimination from net income of a million net gain on investments for the year ended december   and a decrease in deferred taxes of million  primarily from the expiration of certain bonus depreciation tax incentives that were not available for the year ended december  investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december  reflect purchases of radio station assets of million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december  are offset by million from the sale of property  equipment  intangibles and other assets  and million from the sale of investments 
financing activities net cash flows used in financing activities were million for the year ended december   compared to net cash flows used in financing activities of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  reflect the repurchase of million of our class a common stock  a net increase in outstanding indebtedness of million  and the payment of million in dividends to shareholders 
the net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  reflect the repurchase of million of our class a common stock and a net increase in outstanding indebtedness of million 
the net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  reflect the repurchase of million of our class a common stock  a net increase in outstanding indebtedness of million  and deferred financing expense of million related to our new credit facility 
credit rating agencies on a continuing basis  credit rating agencies such as moody s investor services and standard and poor s evaluate our debt in order to assign a credit rating 
as a result of their reviews  our credit rating could change 
any significant downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact our future liquidity 
the effect of a change in our credit rating may limit or eliminate our ability to obtain debt financing  or include  among other things  interest rate changes under any future bank facilities  debentures  notes or other types of debt 
share repurchase programs on may   december   march   november   and may   our board of directors authorized one year share repurchase programs of up to million of our class a common stock for each program 
under these repurchase programs  we repurchased and immediately retired in  million shares for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share  in  million shares for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share  and in  million shares for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share 
depending on market conditions and other factors  these repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice 
as of february   million remained authorized as available for repurchase 
we expect to use cash available under our bank revolver and internally generated cash flow as a source of funds to repurchase shares under the remaining program 
contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than to to more than contractual obligations total year years years years amounts in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total a the maturity on our bank revolver  with outstanding debt in the amount of million as of december   could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain covenants 
the above table includes projected interest expense under the remaining term of the agreement 
b under our million senior subordinated notes  the maturity could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain covenants or could be repaid in cash by us at our option prior to the due date of the notes 
the above table includes projected interest expense under the remaining term of the agreement 
a after extensive litigation  on may   we acquired a radio station for a purchase price of million  which included an award by the court of million in damages as an offset against the original million purchase price 
a successful appeal by the seller could reverse the million in damages awarded by the court 
b we have cash obligations of million to acquire the assets of radio stations under several pending asset purchase agreements in the following markets cincinnati  ohio  austin  texas  memphis  tennessee  rochester  new york  and springfield  massachusetts 
we also have obligations to exchange assets in several markets under two exchange agreements for which an exchange value is dependent upon an appraisal of the assets and which appraisal is not available at this time 
we do not expect that closing on these exchange transaction will require the use of cash 
c we have liabilities of million related to i construction obligations of million in connection with the relocation and consolidation of certain of our studio facilities  ii our obligation of million to provide a letter of credit  and iii an obligation of million to increase our interest in partnerships carried as investments 
d in addition to the above  we have purchase obligations of million that primarily include contracts for on air personalities  sports programming rights  ratings services  music licensing fees  television advertising  equipment maintenance and certain other operating contracts 
included within total other long term liabilities of million are deferred income tax liabilities of million that are recognized for all temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
deferred tax liabilities may vary according to changes in tax laws  tax rates and our operating results 
as a result  it is impractical to determine whether there will be a cash impact to an individual year 
therefore  deferred income tax liabilities have been reflected in the above table in the column labeled as more than years 
off balance sheet arrangements we utilize letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations 
letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
an outstanding letter of credit of million as of december  was immaterial 
we enter into interest rate swap contracts to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt 
see note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our derivative instruments 
under our currently pending transactions to acquire and dispose of radio station assets  we determined that fin r was not applicable as of december  we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes at december  accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements as of december recently issued pronouncements fas no 
on september   the fasb issued financial accounting standard fas no

the standard also responds to investors requests for more information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect that fair value measurements have on earnings 
sfas no

on september   the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
provides guidance on the consideration of effects of the prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
the sec staff believes registrants must quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material

fin on july   the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  and related implementation issues  which provides guidance on the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
under fin  financial statements should reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
the interpretation also revises the disclosure requirements and is effective for us as of january  we are in the process of completing our initial evaluation of fin and its effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows upon adoption on january  subject to any changes to the facts and circumstances used in our evaluation  we expect that the fin liability  inclusive of previous tax contingencies  will be between million to million  which amount will be reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as a long term tax liability as of march  as a result of an increase on january  in liabilities primarily comprised of interest and penalties  approximately million to million in expense net of taxes will be recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change in our consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended march  any change in future period liabilities from interest and penalties  will be reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as an adjustment to income tax expense rather than as an expense that would precede income before income taxes 
we will review our estimates on a quarterly basis and any change in our fin liabilities will result as an adjustment to our income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations in each period measured 
we anticipate that there will be no immediate impact on our cash flows

sfas no 
on june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which required entities that voluntarily make a change in accounting principle to apply that change retrospectively to prior periods financial statements  unless this would be impracticable 
sfas no 
supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  which previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in the current period s net income the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
in addition  another significant change in practice under sfas no 
will be that if an entity changes its method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets  the change must be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate 
under apb opinion no 
 such a change would have been reported as a change in accounting principle 
sfas no

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of reported revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different circumstances or by using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be important in understanding the judgments involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast  and the revenue is recorded net of advertising agency commission 
based upon past experience  the use of these criteria has been a reliable method to recognize revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must make an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make payments to us 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our historical estimates have been a reliable method to estimate future allowances 
our historical reserves have averaged less than of our outstanding receivables 
if the financial condition of our customers or markets were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  then additional allowances could be required 
the effect of a increase in our outstanding accounts receivable allowance as of december   would result in a decrease in net income of million  net of taxes a decrease in net income per common share diluted of  for the year ended december  radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
as of december   we had recorded approximately billion in radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill  which represented approximately of our total assets 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must conduct annual impairment testing required by sfas no 
and charge to operations an impairment expense only in the periods in which the recorded value of these assets is more than their fair value 
we believe our estimate of the value of our radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets  and our estimate of the value contains assumptions incorporating variables that are based on past experiences and judgments about future performance of our stations 
these variables include but are not limited to the forecast growth rate of each radio market  including population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures  market share and profit margin of an average station within a market  estimated capital start up costs and losses incurred during the early years  risk adjusted discount rate  the likely media competition within the market area  and terminal values 
changes in our estimates of the fair value of these assets could result in material future period write downs in the carrying value of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
contingencies and litigation on an on going basis  we evaluate our exposure related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 
estimation of our tax rates significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  income tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate our tax rates regularly and adjust rates when appropriate based on currently available information relative to statutory rates  apportionment factors and the applicable taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate  among other factors 
tax contingencies are also recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
to the extent that we establish a reserve  our provision for income taxes is increased 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
in determining if a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
we believe our estimates of the value of our tax contingencies and valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates as they contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have currently accrued 
in past years  our estimate of our tax rate has varied from to 
the effect of a increase in our estimated tax rate as of december   would result in an increase in income tax expense of million and a decrease in net income of million net income per common share diluted of for the year ended december  valuation of share based compensation we determine the fair value of restricted stock units with service and market conditions using a monte carlo simulation model 
the fair value is based on the use of certain assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
if other reasonable assumptions were used  the results could differ 
we determine the fair value of our employee stock options at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from these traded options 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and expected term of the options granted 
we have used historical data for our stock price and option life when determining expected volatility and expected term  but each year we reassess whether or not historical data is representative of expected results 
intangibles as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of radio broadcast licenses and goodwill  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our business 
we could not operate the radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are subject to renewal every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
subject to delays in processing by the fcc  historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
see part i  item a  risk factors  for a discussion of the risks associated with the renewal of licenses 
inflation inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for radio station operating expenses  including wages and equipment 
the exact impact cannot be reasonably determined 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank revolver 
under certain covenants that are measured periodically  we may be required from time to time to protect ourselves from interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative rate hedging instruments 
if the borrowing rates under libor were to increase above the rates as of december   our interest expense under our bank revolver would increase by approximately million on an annual basis  including any interest expense associated with the use of outstanding derivative rate hedging instruments 
we do not have interest rate risk related to our senior subordinated notes  which have a fixed interest rate of 
as of december   we had a derivative rate hedging transaction in place for a notional amount of million that effectively fixes libor at and expires in the fair value of the rate hedging transaction at december   based upon current market rates  is included as derivative instruments in other long term liabilities according to the maturity date of the instrument 
our rate hedging transaction is tied to the three month libor interest rate  which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
the fair value of the hedging transaction is affected by a combination of several factors  including the change in the three month libor rate and the forward interest rate to maturity 
any increase in the three month libor rate and or the forward interest rate to maturity results in a more favorable valuation  while any decrease in the three month libor rate and or forward interest rate to maturity results in a less favorable valuation 
our derivative instrument liability as of december  was million  which represented a decrease of million from the balance as of december  this decrease was due primarily to an increase in the forward interest rates to maturity  and a decrease of one year in the remaining period of our outstanding hedge 
our credit exposure under this hedging agreement  or similar agreements we may enter into in the future  is the cost of replacing an agreement in the event of non performance by our counter party 
to minimize this risk  we select high credit quality counter parties 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by such counter parties  and no material loss would be expected in the event of the counter parties nonperformance 
our cash equivalents are money market instruments consisting of short term government securities and repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by government securities 
we do not believe that we have any material credit exposure with respect to these assets 
our credit exposure related to our accounts receivable does not represent a significant concentration of credit risk due to the high percentage of local business  the multiple markets in which we operate and the wide variety of advertisers
