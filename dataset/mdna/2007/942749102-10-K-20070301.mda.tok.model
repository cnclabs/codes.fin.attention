item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading supplier of products for use in the water quality  water safety  water flow control and water conservation markets in both north america and europe with an emerging presence in china 
for over years  we have designed and manufactured products that promote the comfort and safety of people and the quality and conservation of water used in commercial and residential applications 
we earn revenue and income almost exclusively from the sale of our products 
our principal product lines include backflow preventers for preventing contamination of potable water caused by reverse flow within water supply lines and fire protection systems  a wide range of water pressure regulators for both commercial and residential applications  water supply and drainage products for commercial and residential applications  temperature and pressure relief valves for water heaters  boilers and associated systems  point of use water filtration and reverse osmosis systems for both commercial and residential applications  thermostatic mixing valves for tempering water in commercial and residential applications  systems for under floor radiant applications and hydraulic pump groups for gas boiler manufacturers and renewable energy applications  including solar and heat pump control packages  flexible stainless steel connectors for natural and liquid propane gas in commercial food service and residential applications  and large diameter butterfly valves for use in china s water infrastructure 
our business is reported in three geographic segments  north america  europe and china 
we distribute our products through three primary distribution channels  wholesale  do it yourself diy and original equipment manufacturers oems 
interest rates have an indirect effect on the demand for our products due to the effect such rates have on the number of new residential and commercial construction starts and remodeling projects 
all three of these activities have an impact on our levels of sales and earnings 
an additional factor that has had an effect on our sales is fluctuation in foreign currencies  as a portion of our sales and certain portions of our costs  assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we believe that the factors relating to our future growth include our ability to continue to make selective acquisitions  both in our core markets as well as new complementary markets  regulatory requirements relating to the quality and conservation of water  increased demand for clean water with continued enforcement of plumbing and building codes and a healthy economic environment 
we have completed acquisitions since divesting our industrial and oil and gas business in our acquisition strategy focuses on businesses that manufacture preferred brand name products that address our themes of water quality  water conservation  water safety and water flow control and related complementary markets 
we target businesses that will provide us with one or more of the following an entry into new markets  an increase in shelf space with existing customers  a new or improved technology or an expansion of the breadth of our water quality  water conservation  water safety and water flow control products for the residential and commercial markets 
in  sales from acquisitions contributed approximately to our total sales growth over the prior year 
products representing a majority of our sales are subject to regulatory standards and code enforcement  which typically require that these products meet stringent performance criteria 
together with our commissioned manufacturers representatives  we have consistently advocated for the development and enforcement of such plumbing codes 
we are focused on maintaining stringent quality control and testing procedures at each of our manufacturing facilities in order to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements and take advantage of the resulting demand for compliant products 
we believe that the product development  product testing capability and investment in plant and equipment needed to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements  represent a barrier to entry for competitors 
we believe there is an increasing demand among consumers for products to ensure water quality  which creates growth opportunities for our products 
we require substantial amounts of raw materials to produce our products  including bronze  brass  cast iron  steel and plastic  and substantially all of the raw materials we require are purchased from outside sources 
we have experienced increases in the costs of certain raw materials  particularly copper 
bronze and brass are copper based alloys 
during  the spot price of copper increased approximately a risk we face is our ability to deal effectively with increases in raw material costs 
we manage this risk by monitoring related market prices  working with our suppliers to achieve the maximum level of stability in their costs and related pricing  seeking alternative supply sources when necessary  implementing cost reduction programs and passing increases in costs to our customers  to the maximum extent possible  when they occur 
additionally from time to time we may use commodity futures contracts on a limited basis to manage this risk 
we are not able to predict whether or for how long these cost increases will continue 
if these cost increases continue and we are not able to reduce or eliminate the effect of the cost increases by reducing production costs or implementing price increases  our profit margins could decrease 
another risk we face in all areas of our business is competition 
we consider brand preference  engineering specifications  code requirements  price  technological expertise  delivery times and breadth of product offerings to be the primary competitive factors 
as mentioned previously  we believe that the product development  product testing capability and investment in plant and equipment needed to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements  represent a barrier to entry for competitors 
we are committed to maintaining our capital equipment at a level consistent with current technologies  and thus we spent approximately  in including approximately  related to the purchase and subsequent sale leaseback of a building in italy and  in we are committed to expanding our manufacturing capacity in lower cost countries such as china  tunisia and bulgaria 
recent developments in february  our board of directors approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of our class a common stock authorized for issuance from  shares to  shares 
this amendment remains subject to approval of our stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders scheduled for may  in february  we declared a quarterly dividend of ten cents per share on each outstanding share of class a common stock and class b common stock 
this is an increase of per share compared to the dividend paid for the comparable period last year 
in november  we issued and sold  shares of class a common stock in an underwritten public offering 
the price to the public of the shares sold in the offering was per share 
the proceeds to the company  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses  was approximately  we expect to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes  including the funding of future acquisitions

we believe free cash flow to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance because it provides investors with a measure of our ability to generate cash  to repay debt and to fund acquisitions 
we may not be comparable to other companies that may define free cash flow differently 
free cash flow does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operations as an indication of our performance 
free cash flow should also not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operations as defined by gaap 
a reconciliation of net cash provided by continuing operations to free cash flow is provided below years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by continuing operations less additions to property  plant  and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of property  plant  and equipment less dividends free cash flow our net debt to capitalization ratio is also a non gaap financial measure used by management 
management believes it to be an appropriate supplemental measure because it helps investors understand our ability to meet our financing needs and as a basis to evaluate our financial structure 
our computation may not be comparable to other companies that may define net debt to capitalization differently

amounts outstanding were approximately  as of december  and  as of december  our letters of credit are primarily associated with insurance coverage and to a lesser extent foreign purchases and generally expire within one year of issuance 
these instruments may exist or expire without being drawn down  therefore they do not necessarily represent future cash flow obligations 
we divested our interest in www 
plumbworld

uk limited plumbworld  a variable interest entity  on august  we had a nominal investment of approximately in plumbworld and maintained a loan receivable that was paid in full  at which time we relinquished our shares in plumbworld 
off balance sheet arrangements except for operating lease commitments  we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
application critical accounting policies and key estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
a critical accounting estimate is an assumption about highly uncertain matters and could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements if another  also reasonable  amount were used  or  a change in the estimate is reasonably likely from period to period 
we base our assumptions on historical experience and on other estimates that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
there were no changes in accounting policies or significant changes in accounting estimates during we periodically discuss the development  selection and disclosure of the estimates with our audit committee 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met we have entered into a binding agreement  the product has shipped and title has passed  the sales price to the customer is fixed or is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue based upon a determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met  which  based on the majority of our shipping terms  is considered to have occurred upon shipment of the finished product 
some shipping terms require the goods to be received by the customer before title passes 
in those instances  revenues are not recognized until the customer has received the goods 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer returns and allowances and for customer programs 
provisions for returns and allowances are made at the time of sale  derived from historical trends and form a portion of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
customer programs  which are primarily annual volume incentive plans  allow customers to earn credit for attaining agreed upon purchase targets from us 
we record customer programs as an adjustment to net sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established to represent our best estimate of the net realizable value of the outstanding accounts receivable 
the development of our allowance for doubtful accounts varies by region but in general is based on a review of past due amounts  historical write off experience  as well as aging trends affecting specific accounts and general operational factors affecting all accounts 
in north america  management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable and establishes specific reserves against financially troubled customers 
in addition  factors are developed utilizing historical trends in bad debts  returns and allowances 
the ratio of these factors to sales on a rolling twelve month basis is applied to total outstanding receivables net of accounts specifically identified to establish a reserve 
in europe  management develops their bad debt allowance through an aging analysis of all their accounts 
in china  management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable and establishes specific reserves as needed 
in addition  for waterworks customers  whose payment terms are generally extended  we reserve the majority of accounts receivable in excess of one year from the invoice date 
we uniformly consider current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also aggressively monitor the creditworthiness of our largest customers  and periodically review customer credit limits to reduce risk 
if circumstances relating to specific customers change or unanticipated changes occur in the general business environment  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with costs generally determined on a first in first out basis 
we utilize both specific product identification and historical product demand as the basis for determining our excess or obsolete inventory reserve 
we identify all inventories that exceed a range of one to four years in sales 
this is determined by comparing the current inventory balance against unit sales for the trailing twelve months 
new products added to inventory within the past twelve months are excluded from this analysis 
a portion of our products contain recoverable materials  therefore the excess and obsolete reserve is established net of any recoverable amounts 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand or changes in technology or features could result in additional obsolete inventory that is not saleable and could require additional inventory reserve provisions 
in certain countries  additional inventory reserves are maintained for potential shrinkage experienced in the manufacturing process 
the reserve is established based on the prior year s inventory losses adjusted for any change in the gross inventory balance 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
we use judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment tests 
we concluded that no impairment existed at october   the time of our latest annual review 
we perform our annual test for indicators of goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets impairment in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or sooner if indicators of impairment exist 
intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
values assigned to intangible assets are determined by an independent valuation firm based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations of the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
since the adoption of fas our valuations have been greater than the carrying value of our goodwill and intangibles 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such factors as future sales volume  selling price changes  material cost changes  cost savings programs and capital expenditures could significantly affect our valuations 
other changes that may affect our valuations include  but are not limited to product acceptances and regulatory approval 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the assets to their realizable value 
a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge to goodwill  which could have a material impact on the results of operations and financial position 
product liability and workers compensation costs because of retention requirements associated with our insurance policies  we are generally self insured for potential product liability claims and for workers compensation costs associated with workplace accidents 
for product liability cases in the us  management estimates expected settlement costs by utilizing loss reports provided by our third party administrators as well as developing internal historical trend factors based on our specific claims experience 
management utilizes the internal trend factors that reflect final expected settlement costs 
in other countries  we maintain insurance coverage with relatively high deductible payments  as product liability claims tend to be smaller than those experienced in the us changes in the nature of claims or the actual settlement amounts could affect the adequacy of this estimate and require changes to the provisions 
because the liability is an estimate  the ultimate liability may be more or less than reported 
workers compensation liabilities in the us are recognized for claims incurred including claims incurred but not reported and for changes in the status of individual case reserves 
at the time a workers compensation claim is filed  a liability is estimated to settle the claim 
the liability for workers compensation claims is determined based on management s estimates of the nature and severity of the claims and based on analysis provided by third party administrators and by various state statutes and reserve requirements 
we have developed our own trend factors based on our specific claims experience 
in other countries where workers compensation costs are applicable  we maintain insurance coverage with limited deductible payments 
because the liability is an estimate  the ultimate liability may be more or less than reported 
we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims in excess of all self insured positions 
any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
legal contingencies we are a defendant in numerous legal matters including those involving environmental law and product liability as discussed further in business product liability  environmental and other litigation matters 
as required by financial accounting standards board statement no 
accounting for contingencies fas  we determine whether an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated  net of any applicable insurance proceeds 
estimates of potential outcomes of these contingencies are developed in consultation with outside counsel 
while this assessment is based upon all available information  litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual liability to fully resolve this litigation cannot be predicted with any assurance of accuracy 
final settlement of these matters could possibly result in significant effects on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
pension benefits we account for our pension plans in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
employers accounting for pensions fas and financial accounting standards board statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  fas 
in applying fas and fas  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
the primary assumptions are as follows weighted average discount rate this rate is used to estimate the current value of future benefits 
this rate is adjusted based on movement in long term interest rates 
expected long term rate of return on assets this rate is used to estimate future growth in investments and investment earnings 
the expected return is based upon a combination of historical market performance and anticipated future returns for a portfolio reflecting the mix of equity  debt and other investments indicative of our plan assets 
rates of increase in compensation levels this rate is used to estimate projected annual pay increases  which are used to determine the wage base used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
we determine these assumptions based on consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
any variance in these assumptions could have a significant impact on future recognized pension costs  assets and liabilities 
income taxes we estimate and use our expected annual effective income tax rates to accrue income taxes 
effective tax rates are determined based on budgeted earnings before taxes including our best estimate of permanent items that will affect the effective rate for the year 
management periodically reviews these rates with outside tax advisors and changes are made if material discrepancies from expectations are identified 
we recognize deferred taxes for the expected future consequences of events that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the rules of financial accounting standards board statement no 
accounting for income taxes fas 
under fas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the book values and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities  using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
new accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial accounting standards board statement fas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and costs of certain raw materials used in the manufacturing process 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging underlying economic exposure 
the derivatives we use are instruments with liquid markets 
our consolidated earnings  which are reported in united states dollars  are subject to translation risks due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk is concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro  the us dollar and the canadian dollar  and the us dollar and the chinese yuan 
our foreign subsidiaries transact most business  including certain intercompany transactions  in foreign currencies 
such transactions are principally purchases or sales of materials and are denominated in european currencies or the us or canadian dollar 
we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage the risk related to intercompany purchases that occur during the course of a year and certain open foreign currency denominated commitments to sell products to third parties 
for  the amounts recorded in other income for the change in the fair value of such contracts was immaterial 
we have historically had a very low exposure on the cost of our debt to changes in interest rates 
interest rate swaps are used to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate debt instruments and reduce interest expense on certain fixed rate instruments 
information about our long term debt including principal amounts and related interest rates appears in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  we purchase significant amounts of bronze ingot  brass rod  cast iron  steel and plastic  which are utilized in manufacturing our many product lines 
our operating results can be adversely affected by changes in commodity prices if we are unable to pass on related price increases to our customers 
we manage this risk by monitoring related market prices  working with our suppliers to achieve the maximum level of stability in their costs and related pricing  seeking alternative supply sources when necessary and passing increases in commodity costs to our customers  to the maximum extent possible  when they occur
