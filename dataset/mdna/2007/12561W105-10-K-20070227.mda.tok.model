item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition regulatory matters retail rates of cleco power  and wholesale rates of cleco 
franchises cleco power operates under nonexclusive franchise rights granted by governmental units  such as municipalities and parishes counties  and enforced by state regulation 
these franchises are for fixed terms  which may vary from years to years or more 
in the past  cleco power has been substantially successful in the timely renewal of franchises as each reached the end of its term 
in march  the city council of covington voted unanimously to extend cleco power a year franchise agreement covering approximately  customers 
this new agreement replaced cleco power s existing agreement which would have expired in cleco power s next municipal franchise expires in in august  a competing electric utility entered into an agreement with the city of new iberia so that the utility could continue to serve its existing customers in the newly annexed area 
however  cleco power has the right under state law to serve any new customers inside the city limits and newly annexed customers 
also in  cooperatives entered into agreements with the cities of opelousas and eunice 
the agreements provide the cooperatives the opportunity to compete with cleco in newly annexed areas only 
the granting of a dual municipal franchise to a competing power cooperative does not reduce current cleco power revenue  since existing customers do not have an option to change electric service providers under existing lpsc regulations 
however  it could reduce future customer and load growth as both utilities compete for new customers 
on february   the city council of eunice voted to accept a city wide franchise proposal with a local electric cooperative 
the cooperative will now have the opportunity to serve customers city wide 
however  both utilities are required to follow the lpsc foot rule regulation to determine which utility can provide electricity to the customer 
in general  if a utility s distribution system is within feet of the new customer s meter point that utility automatically serves the customer 
otherwise  the customer may choose the electricity provider 
this decision does not have a material impact on cleco power s results of operations or financial condition  but could reduce future customer and load growth as both utilities compete for new customers 
currently  cleco power recovers all municipal franchise fees through the base rates it charges retail customers 
consequently  franchise fees are recovered from customers both inside and outside a franchised area 
in october  the lpsc approved the practice of billing franchise fees as a separate line item only to the municipal customers affected  rather than included in base rates to all retail customers 
in november  the lpsc placed the order on hold requesting comments from the louisiana municipal association and louisiana mayors 
the lpsc is expected to vote on the implementation of the order by the second quarter of cleco power anticipates no material impact to its results of operations or financial condition if the order is approved 
a number of parishes have attempted in recent years to impose franchise fees on retail revenue earned within the unincorporated areas cleco power serves 
if the parishes are ultimately successful  cleco power believes the new franchise tax paid to the parishes will be passed on to the affected customers and will not reduce cleco power s earnings

legislative and regulatory changes and matters various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies are considering a number of issues that could shape the future of the electric utility industry 
such issues include  among others implementation of the energy policy act of  regulation of previously deregulated retail electric markets  the ability of electric utilities to recover stranded costs  the role of electric utilities  independent power producers and competitive bidding in the purchase  construction and operation of new generating capacity  the pricing of transmission service on an electric utility s transmission system  ferc s assessment of market power and utilities ability to buy generation assets  mandatory transmission reliability standards  the authority of the ferc to grant utilities the power of eminent domain  increasing requirements for renewable energy sources  comprehensive multi emissions environmental legislation  and ferc s increased ability to impose financial penalties 
the registrants are unable  at this time  to predict the outcome of such issues or effects on their financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
cleco corporation cleco power form k for information on certain regulatory matters and regulatory accounting affecting cleco  see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition regulatory matters 
environmental matters environmental quality cleco is subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment 
violations of these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines and penalties 
cleco has obtained all environmental permits necessary for its operations  and management believes cleco is in compliance in all material respects with these permits  as well as all applicable environmental laws and regulations 
environmental requirements continue to increase as a result of new legislation  administrative actions  and judicial interpretations 
therefore  the future effects of existing and potential requirements are difficult to determine 
cleco s capital expenditures related to environmental compliance were million during and are estimated to total million in the following table lists capital expenditures for environmental matters by subsidiary 
subsidiary thousands environmental capital expenditures for projected environmental capital expenditures for cleco power evangeline acadia total represents aph s portion of acadia the increase in projected environmental capital expenditures at cleco power from to primarily relates to the installation of new low nox burners at the dolet hills and rodemacher unit power stations 
the installation of the low nox burners at dolet hills is expected to be completed during  while the installation of the low nox burners at rodemacher unit is expected to begin in early air quality the state of louisiana regulates air emissions from each of cleco s generating units through the air quality regulations of the ldeq 
in addition  the ldeq has been delegated authority over and implements certain programs established by the epa 
the ldeq establishes standards of performance and requires permits for certain generating units in louisiana 
all of cleco s generating units are subject to these requirements 
the federal clean air act established a regulatory program to address the effects of acid rain and imposed restrictions on so 

emissions from certain generating units 
the federal clean air act requires these generating stations to possess a regulatory allowance for each ton of so emitted beginning in the year the epa allocates a set number of allowances to each affected unit based on its historic emissions 
as of december   cleco power and midstream had sufficient allowances for operations and expect to have sufficient allowances for operations 
the federal clean air act required the epa to revise nox emission limits for existing coal fired boilers 
in november  the epa finalized rules lowering the nox emission rate for certain boilers  which apply to rodemacher unit and dolet hills 
the rules also allowed an early elect option to achieve compliance with a less restrictive nox limit beginning no later than january  cleco power exercised this option in december early election protects cleco power from any further reductions in the nox permitted emission rate until rodemacher unit and dolet hills have been in compliance with the nox early election limits since their inception and are expected to continue to be in compliance in cleco power s phase i low nox burner project was permitted by the ldeq and installed in to achieve compliance with the reduced acid rain permit limits for nox at dolet hills 
rodemacher unit is anticipated to achieve compliance with these reduced acid rain nox limits in its current configuration 
cleco power expects to implement its phase ii low nox burner and overfire air project at dolet hills by early at a projected cost of million 
cleco power expects to implement a similar project by early at rodemacher unit the additional nox reductions achieved by these projects may qualify for early reduction credits under the federal clean air interstate rule cair  and position cleco power s fleet for least cost compliance with cair s requirements for nox reductions 
significant future reductions in nox emissions limits may require other capital improvements at one or both of the units 
nox emissions from the evangeline and acadia generating units are within the units respective permitted limits  as these units use a modern turbine technology and selective catalytic reduction technology that reduces nox emissions to minimal levels 
on march   cair was finalized by the epa 
cair covers the district of columbia and eastern states  including louisiana  and provides a federal framework requiring states to reduce emissions of so and so cair calls for so reductions to begin in the year and so reductions in the epa anticipates that the states will achieve this primarily by reducing emissions from the power generation sector 
louisiana must evaluate the provisions of cair and make changes to the state implementation plan sip to incorporate these requirements by march the ldeq has proposed to remain under the federal implementation plan fip for compliance with cair so provisions 
it has also proposed to follow the fip for the annual nox and ozone season nox trading programs with the exception of the nox allowance allocation methodology 
cleco is evaluating potential compliance strategies to meet the emission reductions contemplated by these regulations 
the installation of new low nox burners and enhancements to the so scrubber at dolet hills is expected to be an integral part of meeting the cair nox and nox reduction provisions 
likewise  the installation of new low nox burners planned for rodemacher unit in early at a projected cost of million should also help meet cleco corporation cleco power form k cair requirements 
cleco s compliance strategy to meet the cair requirements may also include additional emission controls  purchase of allowances  or fuel changes 
on march   the epa issued final rules regarding mercury emissions from electric utility boilers 
the federal clean air mercury rule camr established standards of performance limiting mercury emissions from new and existing coal fired power plants and created a market based cap and trade program 
camr emissions reductions take effect in january louisiana adopted epa s federal camr regulations by reference and incorporated these requirements in louisiana s state regulations 
cleco owns units that will be subject to camr 
cleco is participating with other stakeholders on ldeq s implementation of the federal requirements and is evaluating potential compliance strategies to meet the emission reductions contemplated by these regulations 
these strategies may include additional emission controls  purchase of allowances  or fuel changes 
multi pollutant legislation is expected to be considered by congress 
this legislation could include requirements to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions 
cleco supports the concept of a comprehensive national and international strategy to reduce emissions of multiple pollutants from electric utilities  as well as other industries 
in addition  congress is considering several bills related to climate change  which include mandatory cuts in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas omissions 
the majority of the bills would require reductions in carbon dioxide from electric generating units 
on november   the us supreme court heard arguments in a case  massachusetts vs 
epa  in which the ep circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia held that the epa had discretion to refuse to regulate greenhouse gases from mobile sources 
enactment of federal climate change legislation or a supreme court decision reversing the appellate decision could result in federal regulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas omissions 
states may also independently decide to regulate greenhouse gases 
cleco will continue to monitor the development of new legislative and regulatory requirements and their potential impacts 
while it is unknown at this time what the final outcome of these regulations will entail or whether federal or state carbon dioxide laws or regulations will be enacted  any capital and operating costs of additional pollution control equipment or carbon dioxide emission reduction measures  such as the cost of sequestration or purchasing allowances  or offset credits  that may be required could materially adversely affect future results of operations  cash flows  and possibly financial condition  unless such costs could be recovered through regulated rates and or future market prices for energy 
as mandated by the law  the ldeq developed and promulgated the comprehensive toxic air pollutant emission control regulation under title  chapter of the louisiana administrative code 
this rule requires that any major source of toxic air emissions  as defined by the ldeq  shall control emissions of toxic air pollutants to a degree that constitutes maximum achievable control technology mact 
mact is determined by the permitting authority  in this case the ldeq 
in addition to incorporating the control technology standards  the state rule establishes emission reporting requirements for all major sources of toxic air pollutants and sets an ambient air standard for each pollutant 
steam electric generating units traditionally have been exempt from this rule 
however  on december   the ldeq proposed rules removing the exemption from such units 
while it is unknown at this time what the final rule will entail  any capital and operating costs of additional pollution control equipment could have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
in february  cleco power received notices from the epa requesting information relating to the rodemacher and dolet hills power stations 
the apparent purpose of the investigation is to determine whether cleco power has complied with new source review and new source performance standards requirements under the clean air act in connection with capital expenditures  modifications  or operational changes made at these facilities 
cleco power has completed its response to the initial data request 
it is unknown at this time whether the epa will take further action as a result of the information provided by cleco power and if any such action would have a material adverse impact on the registrants financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
water quality cleco has received from the epa and ldeq permits required under the federal clean water act for waste water discharges from its five generating stations 
waste water discharge permits have fixed dates of expiration  and cleco applies for renewal of these permits within the applicable time periods 
the ldeq issued a louisiana pollutant discharge elimination system waste water permit renewal for evangeline power station on june  this waste water permit contains certain additional copper and total dissolved solids tds permit limitations that cleco contends are beyond the legal authority of ldeq to include in the waste water permit 
cleco challenged these permit provisions by filing a de novo review judicial appeal on september   in district court in east baton rouge parish  louisiana 
while litigation has been filed  cleco actively is engaged with ldeq in settlement discussions regarding the appealed provisions of the waste water permit  and cleco believes that an amicable resolution will be reached with the agency 
while the filed litigation is pending  the appealed copper and tds permit limitations are stayed and do not take effect 
the uncontested portions of the evangeline waste water permit were effective january  another new regulatory program  section b of the clean water act  intends to minimize adverse environmental impacts to all aquatic species due to water intake structures 
these regulations establish requirements applicable to the location  design  construction  and capacity of cooling water intake structures and only apply to existing facilities 
cleco anticipates that any new requirements will be established as the facilities go through the water discharge permit renewal process 
the required initial studies began in and will continue into  and required capital improvements will cleco corporation cleco power form k occur after those studies are completed 
capital improvement costs are anticipated to be between million and million 
solid waste disposal the solid waste division of the ldeq has adopted a permitting system for the management and disposal of solid waste generated by power stations 
cleco has received all required permits from the ldeq for the on site disposal of solid waste from its generating stations 
cleco is in the process of renewing the solid waste permits for the rodemacher and dolet hills solid waste units and upgrading them according to the solid waste regulations 
these upgrades are not expected to result in substantial costs 
hazardous waste generation cleco produces certain wastes that are classified as hazardous at its five generating stations and at other locations 
cleco does not treat  store long term  or dispose of these wastes on site  therefore  no permits are required 
all hazardous wastes produced by cleco are disposed of at federally permitted hazardous waste disposal sites 
toxic substances control act tsca the tsca directs the epa to regulate the marketing  disposal  manufacturing  processing  distribution in commerce  and use of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs 
cleco may continue to operate equipment containing pcbs under the tsca 
once the equipment reaches the end of its usefulness  the epa regulates handling and disposal of the equipment and fluids containing pcbs 
within these regulations  the handling and disposal is allowed only through epa approved and permitted facilities 
the epa revised tsca regulations to require utilities to report data on the manufacture or import of organic compounds every five years 
cleco submitted this information in december for its applicable facilities 
toxics release inventory tri the tri requires an annual report from industrial facilities on about substances that they release into air  water  and land 
the tri ranks companies based on how much of a particular substance they release on a state and parish county level 
annual reports are due to the epa on july following the reporting year end 
cleco has submitted required tri reports on its activities  and the tri rankings are available to the public 
the rankings do not result in any federal or state penalties 
management is aware of the potential adverse public perceptions and monitors the tri process 
electric and magnetic fields emfs the possibility that exposure to emfs emanating from electric power lines  household appliances  and other electric devices may result in adverse health effects or damage to the environment has been a subject of some public attention 
cleco power funds scientific research on emfs through various organizations 
to date  there are no definitive results  but research is continuing 
lawsuits alleging that the presence of electric power transmission and distribution lines has an adverse effect on health and or property values have arisen in several states 
cleco power is not a party in any lawsuits related to emfs 
cleco corporation cleco power form k item a 
risk factors the following risk factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the registrants 
rodemacher unit construction costs the recovery of costs incurred to construct rodemacher unit is subject to lpsc review and approval  and some of the costs could be disallowed 
costs incurred in the construction of rodemacher unit are subject to a prudency review by the lpsc 
one year prior to the in service date of rodemacher unit  cleco power will file a rate case with the lpsc seeking to recover the construction costs in its base rates 
cleco power will be required to demonstrate that the costs incurred to construct rodemacher unit were prudently incurred and demonstrate the impact of the operation of the facility on its customers 
accordingly  cleco power may not be able to recover some of the costs incurred to construct the facility  which could be substantial 
furthermore  although the amended epc contract is generally a fixed price agreement  unforeseen events could result in changes in the scope of the project that may result in additional costs 
it may be more difficult to obtain lpsc approval to recover such additional costs 
if the lpsc were to deny cleco power s request to recover substantial costs incurred in the construction of the facility  such a decision could have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
rodemacher unit technical specifications cleco power is exposed to certain risks related to the design  construction and operation of rodemacher unit this project has technology risk  fuel supply risk and general contractor and certain material subcontractor performance risk  each of which could have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
rodemacher unit is designed to utilize circulating fluidized bed cfb generating technology 
under the amended epc contract  shaw is liable for liquidated damages for non performance 
however  cleco power s ability to collect any damages for breach is contingent on the demonstration of such damages and on shaw s financial abilities 
failure by shaw to perform its obligations under the amended epc contract could have a material adverse impact on the plant s efficiency  in service date  and final cost 
the amended epc contract does not protect cleco power against force majeure events or design specification oversight which may result in increased and potentially unrecoverable costs to cleco power 
although cleco power currently delivers coal via rail to the rodemacher facility  plans are for rodemacher unit to primarily use petroleum coke  which can be delivered most economically via barges on the mississippi and red rivers  requiring a conveyor system which has to cross an interstate highway 
while cleco power is currently negotiating contracts with barge owners and operators  cleco power does not have experience coordinating the transportation of fuel by barge 
calpine bankruptcy ces s bankruptcy and failure to perform its obligations under the calpine tolling agreements could have a material adverse effect on cleco corporation s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
a substantial portion of midstream s earnings and cash flows was derived from the calpine tolling agreements with ces 
in december  the calpine debtors filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the calpine debtors bankruptcy court and subsequently filed a motion with the court seeking to reject the calpine tolling agreements 
the issue was referred to the us district court for the southern district of new york  where in january  a federal judge dismissed the calpine debtors motion to reject eight power supply contracts  including the calpine tolling agreements 
the judge ruled that the ferc  not the bankruptcy court  has exclusive jurisdiction over the disposition of the energy contracts 
calpine has appealed this ruling to the us court of appeals for the second circuit 
as of the date of this filing  no decision has been rendered by the court 
ces has failed to pay december pre petition amounts totaling million and all post petition amounts due under the calpine tolling agreements 
the tolling agreements provide for aph to receive  in the event of a ces default  guaranteed priority cash payments totaling million through and million thereafter through acadia will make these annual cash payments to aph only when cash is available  and any unpaid amounts will accumulate to aph 
the guaranteed and priority annual cash payments are still in effect  however  no cash was declared available by acadia during in march  the calpine debtors bankruptcy court approved an amendment to each of the calpine tolling agreements permitting acadia to suspend its obligations under those tolling agreements 
cleco continues to pursue opportunities in both the short and long term markets 
acadia is now operating as a merchant generating company and energy management services are being provided by a third party marketer 
although cleco has not been required to record an impairment with respect to acadia as a result of the calpine bankruptcy proceedings  future events such as a decline in the anticipated market value of energy in relation to natural gas values could cause acadia s carrying value to exceed its market value  requiring an impairment charge 
such a charge could adversely affect cleco corporation s financial condition by reducing consolidated common shareholders equity  causing cleco corporation to incur increased interest costs on future debt issuances  or causing an adverse change in cleco corporation s credit ratings 
cleco corporation cleco power form k deferred lignite mining costs the recovery of deferred lignite costs related to the lignite mining agreement is subject to lpsc review and approval 
in may  cleco power along with swepco entered into the lignite mining agreement with dhlc  the operator of the dolet hills mine 
as ordered then by the lpsc  cleco power s retail customers began receiving fuel cost savings equal to of the projected costs under the previous mining contract the benchmark price through the year actual mining costs incurred above of the benchmark price are deferred  and will be recovered from retail customers through the fuel adjustment clause when the actual mining costs are below of the benchmark price 
at december   cleco power had deferred million in lignite mining costs 
in november  cleco power and swepco submitted a joint application to the lpsc requesting full recovery  through the fuel adjustment clause  of their respective deferred lignite costs as well as the elimination of any future benchmarking of lignite mining costs 
if the lpsc were to deny cleco power s request  then cleco power would be required to recognize any unrecoverable costs as an expense  and such an expense could likely have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the lpsc s implementing order  once issued  granting recovery of cleco power s deferred lignite costs may be appealed within days after the implementing order is issued 
any request for rehearing or appeal of any recovery amount could have a material adverse impact on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
fuel cost audits the lpsc conducts fuel audits that could result in cleco power making substantial refunds of previously recorded revenue 
generally  fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered through the lpsc established fuel adjustment clause  which enables cleco power to pass on to its customers substantially all such charges 
recovery of fuel adjustment clause costs is subject to refund until monthly approval is received from the lpsc  however  all amounts are subject to a periodic fuel audit by the lpsc 
in july  the lpsc commenced a periodic fuel audit including cleco power s fuel adjustment clause filings for january through december cleco power could be required to make a substantial refund of previously recorded revenue as a result of this audit  and such refund could result in a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
the most recent audit completed by the lpsc covered and and resulted in a refund of million to cleco power s retail customers in the first quarter of hedging and risk management activities cleco power is subject to market risk associated with economic hedges relating to open natural gas contracts 
cleco has risk management policies which cannot eliminate all risk involved in its energy commodity activities 
cleco power utilizes economic hedges to mitigate the risks associated with a fixed price wholesale power contract that is not included in the fuel adjustment clause 
any realized gain or loss attributable to these hedges is recorded on the income statement as a component of operating revenue  net 
accordingly  changes in the market value of these hedging arrangements caused by natural gas price volatility will impact the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco power also has entered into economic hedge positions to mitigate the volatility in fuel costs passed through to its retail customers 
when these positions close  actual gains or losses are deferred and included in the fuel adjustment clause in the month the physical contract settles 
however  recovery of any of these fuel adjustment clause costs is subject to  and may be disallowed as part of  a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit conducted by the lpsc 
cleco power manages its exposure to energy commodity activities by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures 
these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risk associated with these activities 
future electricity sales cleco power s future electricity sales and corresponding base revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by general economic conditions 
general market conditions can negatively impact the businesses of cleco power s industrial customers  resulting in decreased power purchases by them and decreased base revenue 
cleco power s largest industrial customers  specifically those who manufacture wood and paper products who generated base revenue of approximately million in  have experienced a downturn in their respective markets 
the downturn in residential home construction has caused a significant reduction in the demand and prices for lumber and other wood products 
the paper industry has been vulnerable in recent years as a result of a mature market with pressures from overseas manufacturers 
the rice and sugar cane industries  although recovered from the damage caused by the hurricane season  remain vulnerable to competition from overseas processors 
reduced production or the shut down of any of these customers facilities could substantially reduce cleco power s base revenue 
the high cost of energy  in general  has become problematic in many industries and has increased interest by industrial customers in switching to alternative sources of energy  including on site power generation 
also  retail customers may consume less electricity due to increased conservation efforts or increased electric usage efficiency 
cleco corporation cleco power form k purchased power nonperformance of cleco power s power purchase agreements and transmission constraints could have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco power does not supply all of its customers power from the generation facilities it owns and must purchase additional energy and capacity from the wholesale power market in order to meet their demands 
during  cleco power met approximately of its energy needs with purchased power 
a mw power purchase agreement with williams  which expires in  and other short and long term power purchase agreements provided approximately of cleco power s capacity needs in cleco power plans to meet its energy and capacity needs with the williams mw contract  a one year  mw contract with nrg power marketing  inc  and a one year  mw contract with the conocophillips company 
if these providers of additional energy or capacity do not perform under their respective contracts  cleco power would have to replace these supply sources with alternative market sources  the terms of which may not be as favorable and could increase the ultimate cost of power to cleco power s customers 
because of cleco power s location on the transmission grid  cleco power relies on two main suppliers of electric transmission when accessing external power markets 
at times  physical constraints limit the amount of purchased power these transmission providers can deliver into cleco power s service territory  which in turn can affect capacity or power purchases under long term contracts  as well as spot market power purchases 
if the amount of purchased power actually delivered into cleco s transmission system were less than the amount of power contracted for delivery  cleco power may rely on its own generation facilities to meet customer demand 
cleco power s incremental generation cost  at that time  could be higher than the cost to purchase power from the wholesale power market  thereby increasing its customers ultimate cost 
in addition  the lpsc may not allow cleco power to recover part or all of its incremental generation cost  which could be substantial 
weather sensitivity the operating results of cleco power are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity  particularly kwh sales to residential customers 
in cleco power s service territory  like in many parts of the country  demand for power peaks during the hot summer months  with market power prices also peaking at that time 
as a result  cleco power s financial results may fluctuate on a seasonal basis 
in addition  cleco power has sold less power  and consequently earned less income  when weather conditions are milder 
unusually mild weather in the future could adversely impact the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
severe weather  including hurricanes and winter storms  can be destructive  causing outages and property damage that can potentially result in additional expenses and lower revenue 
commodity prices cleco power is subject to the fluctuation in the market prices of various commodities which may increase the cost of producing power 
cleco power purchases coal  lignite  natural gas and fuel oil under long term contracts and on the spot market 
historically  the markets for oil  natural gas and coal have been volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future 
cleco power s retail rates include a fuel adjustment clause that enables it to adjust rates for monthly fluctuations in the cost of fuel and purchased power 
however  recovery of any of these fuel adjustment clause costs is subject to  and may be disallowed as part of  a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit conducted by the lpsc 
evangeline plant performance evangeline has certain plant performance obligations defined in its tolling agreement 
failure to perform these obligations could expose evangeline to adverse financial penalties 
performance requirements in the evangeline tolling agreement include  but are not limited to  maintaining plant performance characteristics such as heat rate and demonstrated generation capacity and maintaining specified availability levels with a combination of plant availability and replacement power 
obligations under the tolling agreement include  but are not limited to  maintaining various types of insurance  maintaining power and natural gas metering equipment  and paying scheduled interest and principal payments on debt 
in addition to the performance obligations by evangeline  there are various guarantees and commitments required by cleco corporation 
if evangeline fails to operate within specified requirements  the facility may purchase replacement power on the open market and provide it to the tolling counterparty in order to meet contractual performance specifications 
providing replacement power maintains availability levels  but exposes evangeline to power commodity price volatility and transmission constraints 
if availability targets under the tolling agreement are not met and economical purchased power and transmission are not available  evangeline s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
ferc staff investigation the remedial actions that the ferc ultimately may take with respect to the results of the current ferc staff investigation could have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
in july  the ferc issued an order approving the consent agreement that settled the ferc investigation following cleco corporation cleco power form k cleco s disclosure in november of certain energy marketing and trading practices 
there were numerous elements to the consent agreement  including but not limited to i a filing by cleco s public utility subsidiaries with the ferc of revised codes of conduct that impose more stringent restrictions on affiliate relations  and ii implementation of a compliance plan for ferc regulatory compliance for cleco s public utility subsidiaries 
the compliance plan had a three year term  which ended in august and required periodic reporting to the ferc regarding the implementation of  and continued compliance with  the compliance plan 
in november  after a review of cleco s october quarterly compliance report  the ferc staff initiated a preliminary  non public investigation into certain representations made by cleco in the course of the ferc staff s investigation underlying the consent agreement 
in response to data requests from the ferc staff  cleco has provided information regarding those representations as well as compliance with the code of conduct and compliance plan contained in the consent agreement 
the information primarily concerns the possible sharing of employees and information among cleco s subsidiaries  as well as the accuracy of information furnished to the ferc staff in connection with reporting on compliance with the consent agreement 
until the issues raised in the current informal investigation are resolved  cleco will voluntarily operate pursuant to the compliance plan that expired in august it is possible that one of the results the investigation may yield is a violation of ferc rules and regulations 
cleco management is unable to predict the results of the outcome of the investigation or the remedial actions that the ferc may take 
the remedial actions that the ferc ultimately may take if they so choose with respect to the results of the investigation could have a material adverse impact on the registrants results of operations and cash flows 
cleco power generation facilities cleco power s generation facilities are susceptible to unplanned outages  significant maintenance requirements and interruption of fuel deliveries 
the operation of power generation facilities involves many risks  including breakdown or failure of equipment  fuel interruption and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
some of cleco power s facilities were originally constructed many years ago 
older equipment  even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices  may require significant expenditures to operate at peak efficiency or availability 
if cleco power fails to make adequate expenditures for equipment maintenance  cleco power risks incurring more frequent unplanned outages  higher than anticipated operating and maintenance expenditures  increased fuel or power purchase costs and potentially the loss of revenue related to competitive opportunities 
cleco power s generating facilities are fueled primarily by coal  natural gas and lignite 
the deliverability of these fuel sources may be constrained due to such factors as higher demand  production shortages  lack of transportation capacity or weather related disturbances 
if the suppliers are unable to deliver the contracted volume of fuel  cleco power would have to replace any deficiency with alternative sources  which may not be as favorable and could increase the ultimate cost of fuel to customers 
fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered from customers through the fuel adjustment clause  which is subject to refund until either a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit is conducted by the lpsc 
ero in  the ferc s authority was expanded to include the establishment and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards on the transmission system as well as the capacity to impose fines and civil penalties on those who fail to comply with those standards 
the energy policy act of authorizes the creation of an ero with authority to establish and enforce mandatory reliability standards  subject to ferc approval  for users of the nation s transmission system 
in july  the ferc named the north american electric reliability council nerc as the ero 
the nerc s former system of reliability standards was based upon voluntary compliance 
the ferc has adopted some of the nerc s standards while modifying others 
the ferc has stated its intent to begin enforcing compliance with these standards on june  a final order is expected to be issued by the ferc in march these standards may impose additional operating requirements on cleco power  acadia  attala  evangeline  and perryville which may result in an increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses 
failure to comply with the reliability standards approved by the ferc can result in the imposition of fines and civil penalties
