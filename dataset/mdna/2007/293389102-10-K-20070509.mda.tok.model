results of operations consolidated fiscal years ended statements of earnings data net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative income from operations other expense earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes net earnings critical accounting policies and judgments in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the disclosures and reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis  including those related to allowance for doubtful receivables  inventory valuations  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  pension plan  accrued liabilities and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical due to their affect on our more significant estimates and judgments used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain a defined benefit pension plan for employees 
included in our financial results are pension costs that are measured using actuarial valuations 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ from actual results 
amounts allocated to intangibles are determined based on independent valuations for our acquisitions and are amortized over their expected useful lives 
we evaluate these amounts periodically at least once a year to determine whether the value has been impaired by events occurring during the fiscal year 
we exercise judgment in evaluating our long lived assets for impairment 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets that include other intangible assets  goodwill  and property  plant  and equipment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in performing tests of impairment  we must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the 
table of contents fair value of the respective assets in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the future 
actual results could differ from assumptions made by management 
we believe our businesses will generate sufficient undiscounted cash flow to more than recover the investments we have made in property  plant and equipment  as well as the goodwill and other intangibles recorded as a result of our acquisitions 
we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of products 
net sales consist of gross sales invoiced to customers  less certain related charges  including discounts  returns and other allowances 
returns  discounts and other allowances have historically been insignificant 
in some cases and upon customer request  ennis prints and stores custom print product for customer specified future delivery  generally within twelve months 
in this case  risk of loss from obsolescence passes to the customer  the customer is invoiced under normal credit terms and revenue is recognized when manufacturing is complete 
approximately million  million and million of revenue was recognized under these agreements during fiscal years ended february    and respectively 
derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in fair values of derivatives are accounted for based upon their intended use and designation 
when utilized  interest rate swaps are held for purposes other than trading 
in the past  the company utilized swap agreements related to its term and revolving loans to effectively fix the interest rate for a specified principal amount 
the swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges  and the after tax effect of the mark to market valuation that relates to the effective amount of derivative financial instrument is recorded as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income with the offset included in accrued expenses 
there were no derivatives  swaps or deferred gains or losses at the end of fiscal year or we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables to reflect estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based upon historical collection trends  current economic factors  and the assessment of the collectability of specific accounts 
we evaluate the collectability of specific accounts using a combination of factors  including the age of the outstanding balances  evaluation of customers current and past financial condition and credit scores  recent payment history  current economic environment  discussions with our project managers  and discussions with the customers directly 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory values on hand  using specific aging categories  and write down inventory deemed obsolete and or slow moving based on historical usage and estimated future usage to its estimated market value 
as actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of earnings 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
in addition to the above  we also have to make assessments as to the adequacy of our accrued liabilities  more specifically our liabilities recorded in connection with our workers compensation and health insurance  as these plans are self funded 
to help us in this evaluation process  we routinely get outside third party assessments of our potential liabilities under each plan 

table of contents in view of such uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on our forward looking statements since such statements speak only as of the date when made 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise

the increase in our earnings and earnings per share during fiscal year related primarily to the additional earnings derived from alstyle apparel which was acquired in november results of operations segments fiscal year ending net sales by segment in thousands print apparel total print segment 
the print segment net sales represented   and of our consolidated net sales for fiscal years   and  respectively 
our net sales for the print segment were approximately million for fiscal year compared to approximately million for fiscal year  or an increase of million  or 
the increase in the print segment s net sales for the fiscal year is primarily due to our acquisitions of spf  tbf and block which added approximately million to our print sales during the current year 
this increase was offset by the loss of two large customers  which we ceased doing business with during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and second quarter of fiscal year  respectively 
this loss amounted to approximately million in lost revenues this fiscal year 
we realized our decision to cease doing business with these large customers would most likely impact 
table of contents our top line revenue in the short term  however  given the gross profit margins afforded by these customers  this was a business decision that needed to be made and one that on a bottom line basis would prove beneficial to our shareholders

our fiscal year net sales for the apparel segment was approximately million compared to approximately million for fiscal year  or an increase of million  or 
the increase in the apparel segment s net sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with new customers  which is attributable to our market penetration pricing strategies  which contributed to growth in the third and fourth quarter

annualizing this segment s fiscal year revenues would arrive at a comparable full year sales figure of approximately million  which would correlate in a full year over year sales increase of approximately million  or 
alstyle apparel was acquired november  and formed our apparel segment 
as such  apparel net sales were included for approximately a quarter in our fiscal year results 
historically  our third and fourth quarters have been this group s lowest quarters  and conversely  our first and second quarters have been the segment s highest revenue quarters

our print segment s gross profit increased approximately million  or and million  or for fiscal years and  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  our gross profit was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our gross profit during fiscal year was impacted by the decrease in margins at our adams mcclure facility  which related primarily to operational performance issues encountered in executing several large promotional contracts 
this conversely had a positive impact on our margins during fiscal year when we exited these contracts in the later half of fiscal year and the first half of fiscal year apparel segment 
our apparel segment s gross profit increased approximately million  or for fiscal year as a result of increased sales 
our apparel segment s gross profit increased million for fiscal year as previously discussed  this segment s results for fiscal year were only for a portion of the year since november

our apparel segment s gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased during fiscal year due to raw material cost increases and the inability to pass these through to the marketplace  lower absorption of fixed costs and manufacturing costs due to lower manufacturing levels  and market penetration pricing strategies employed during the third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year which drove higher sales 
in addition  our margins during the current period were impacted by a lower manufacturing absorption factor as we reduced our apparel inventory levels during the year by over million 
while the aforementioned factors had a negative impact on our apparel margins this year  they in turn had a positive impact on our apparel margins last year 
our apparel segment s gross profit as a percentage of sales increased during fiscal year primarily as a result of the 
table of contents following factors favorable product mix  reduced material costs  improved manufacturing processes which resulted in manufacturing efficiencies and inventory reserves

our apparel segment s profit increased approximately million  or for fiscal year primarily due to increased sales 
our apparel segment s profit increased million for fiscal year as previously discussed  this segment s fiscal year results were only for a portion of the year since november  
as a percent of sales  this segment s profits were   and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
during the current year  while this segment s gross margins were down slightly due to the factors previously mentioned  we were able to successfully leverage increased sales volume to bring increased profits to our bottom line  as evidenced by the fact that sales increased by for the year but profits increased for the year 
the majority of the improvement in profit as a percent of sales for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year came through improvements in this segment s manufacturing performance as discussed previously  the remainder came through operational improvements which reduced expense 
liquidity and capital resources february  february  dollars in thousands change working capital cash and cash equivalents working capital 
our working capital increased by approximately million  or from million at february  to million at february  the increase in our working capital during the period related primarily to an increase in our accounts receivable and prepaid expenses of million  and a decrease in the current portion of our long term debt of million  which related primarily to a million payment on the former alstyle shareholder notes 
this was offset by a reduction in our cash of million 
as a result  our current ratio  calculated by dividing our current assets by our current liabilities increased from to at february  to to at february  cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents consists of highly liquid investments  such as time deposits held at major banks  commercial paper  united states government agency discounts notes  money market mutual funds and other money market securities with original maturities of days or less

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fin requires a two step approach to determine how to recognize tax benefits in the financial statements where recognition and measurement of a tax benefit must be evaluated separately 
a tax benefit will be recognized only if it meets a more likely than not recognition threshold 
for tax positions that meet this threshold  the tax benefit recognized is based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
we have completed a substantial analysis of fin  except for the effects of transfer pricing of transactions between united states and foreign subsidiaries  and therefore  we have not completed our analysis and determined whether an adjustment will be required

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk interest rates we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt 
we may from time to time utilize interest rate swaps to manage overall borrowing costs and reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on short term and long term financial instruments carrying variable interest rates 
our variable rate financial instruments  including the outstanding credit facilities  totaled million at february  the impact on our results of operations of a one point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of the variable rate financial instruments as of february  would be approximately million 
foreign exchange we have global operations and thus make investments and enter into transactions in various foreign currencies 
the value of our consolidated assets and liabilities located outside the united states translated at period end exchange rates and income and expenses translated using average rates prevailing during the period  generally denominated in pesos and canadian dollars  are affected by the translation into our reporting currency the us dollar 
such translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
in future periods  foreign exchange rate fluctuations could have an increased impact on our reported results of operations 
however  due to the self sustaining nature of our foreign operations  we believe we can effectively manage the effect of these currency fluctuations
