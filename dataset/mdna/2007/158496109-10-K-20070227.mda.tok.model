item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading producer of factory built housing in the united states 
as of december   we operated homebuilding facilities in states in the us and two provinces in western canada 
as of december   our homes were sold through more than  independent sales centers  builders  and developers across the us and western canada 
approximately of the independent retailer locations were members of our champion home centers chc retail distribution network 
as of december   our homes were also sold through company owned sales locations in california 
we are also a leading modular builder in the united kingdom 
on april   we acquired united kingdom based calsafe group holdings limited and its operating subsidiary caledonian building systems limited caledonian 
caledonian  a leading modular manufacturer  constructs steel framed modular buildings for use as prisons  military accommodations  hotels and residential units 
caledonian s steel framed modular technology allows for multi story construction  which is a key advantage over wood framed construction techniques 
our international manufacturing segment the international segment currently consists of four manufacturing facilities that caledonian operates in the united kingdom 
the results of operations of caledonian are included in our results from continuing operations and in our international segment for the year ended december  on july  we acquired certain of the assets and the business of north american housing corp 
and an affiliate north american 
north american is a modular homebuilder that operates two homebuilding facilities in virginia 
this acquisition expanded our presence in the modular construction industry  particularly in the mid atlantic region of the us the results of operations of north american are included in our results from continuing operations and in our manufacturing segment for the year ended december  on march   we acquired of the membership interests of highland manufacturing company  llc highland  a manufacturer of modular and hud code homes 
this acquisition further expanded our presence in the modular construction industry and increased our manufacturing and distribution in several states previously under served by us in the north central us the results of operations of highland are included in our results from continuing operations and in our manufacturing segment for the year ended december  on august   we acquired the assets of new era building systems  inc  a leading modular homebuilder  and its affiliates  castle housing of pennsylvania ltd 
and carolina building solutions llc collectively  the new era group 
the results of operations of the new era group are included in our results from continuing operations and in our manufacturing segment for the years ended december  and december  north american  highland and caledonian are referred to as the acquisitions and their results are included in our consolidated results from their respective acquisition dates 
for the past five years the us manufactured housing hud code industry has been affected by limited availability of consumer financing and floor plan inventory financing  high levels of homes repossessed from consumers  tightened consumer credit standards  and other factors 
excluding homes sold to fema in and  annual industry shipments of hud code homes have averaged  homes during the last four years as compared to  homes in industry shipments of hud code homes totaled  in  which was the lowest industry volume since the acquisitions in and were part of our strategy to diversify our operations with a focus on increasing our modular homebuilding presence in the us and to seek modular opportunities outside of the us the hud code industry conditions have affected our u 
s operations during the past several years 
despite these conditions  we started with million in unfilled orders for manufactured housing  a record level for champion 
during  the broader housing market became more difficult  as evidenced by a decline in new housing starts and an over decline in existing home sales 
in addition  inventories of unsold homes increased significantly in many markets in the us as a result  our business in the us softened throughout the year and for much of the second half of  most of our us plants operated on one week or less of unfilled orders 
results of the acquisitions helped to offset lower sales from existing operations 
meanwhile  our canadian operations enjoyed high sales volumes and high levels of unfilled orders throughout 
table of contents our pretax income from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million versus million in compared to  our manufacturing segment income declined million on flat sales despite the acquisitions of highland and north american and a full year of results from the new era group 
the difficult us housing market during the second half of led to lower sales volumes and production inefficiencies at most of our plants 
this decrease was partially offset by income of million from our new international segment 
included in income from continuing operations for the year ended december  were gains of million  primarily from the sale of an investment property in florida and five idle manufacturing plants  a fixed asset impairment charge of million for the closure of a manufacturing plant and a million reduction to our closed plant warranty accrual 
included in income from continuing operations for the year ended december  were a credit of million for the change in estimated fair value of a common stock warrant  a loss on debt retirement of million  gains of million from the sale of three idle plants and an accrual of additional closed plant warranty costs of million 
effective july   we reversed substantially all of the previously recorded valuation allowance for of deferred tax assets after determining that realization of the deferred tax assets was more likely than not 
the reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in recording a million non cash income tax benefit in the second quarter of subsequent to this reversal  our earnings are fully taxed for financial reporting purposes 
during the year ended december   we completed the disposal of our traditional retail operations through the sale of our remaining traditional retail sales centers 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 applying the conditions in paragraph of sfas no 
in determining whether to report discontinued operations  the traditional retail sales centers closed or sold in and along with their related administrative offices are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
retail restructuring charges in are also included with discontinued operations 
continuing retail operations in  and consist of our ongoing non traditional california retail operations 
during the first quarter of and the fourth quarter of  we sold homes and  homes  respectively  to the federal emergency management agency fema in connection with its hurricane relief efforts  resulting in revenues of million and million  respectively 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on various related matters such as derecognition  interest and penalties  and disclosure 
fin is effective with our fiscal year beginning december  we expect that the financial impact  if any  of applying the provisions of fin to all tax positions will not be material upon the initial adoption of fin in the first quarter of we continue to focus on matching our factory built housing manufacturing capacity to industry and local market conditions and improving or eliminating under performing manufacturing facilities 
since june  we have closed five homebuilding plants in the us  including one that was closed in january we continually review our manufacturing capacity and will make further adjustments as deemed necessary

contingent repurchase obligations manufacturing segment we are contingently obligated under repurchase agreements with certain lending institutions that provide floor plan financing to our independent retailers 
upon default by a retailer under a floor plan financing agreement subject to an associated repurchase agreement  the manufacturer is generally required to repurchase the loan or the home for the unpaid balance of the floor plan loan  subject to certain adjustments 
in the event of such repurchases  our loss is equal to the difference between the repurchase price and the net price we realize upon resale of the home  less any related reserves or accrued volume rebates that will not be paid 
each quarter we review our contingent wholesale repurchase obligations to assess the adequacy of our reserves for repurchase losses 
this analysis is based on a review of current and historical experience  reports received from the primary national floor plan lenders that provide floor plan financing for approximately of our manufacturing sales  and information regarding the performance of our retailers obtained from our manufacturing facilities 
we do not retain repurchase risk for cash sales and we do not always enter into repurchase agreements with floor plan lenders that provide financing for the balance of our manufacturing sales to independent retailers 
the estimated repurchase obligation is calculated as the total amount that would be paid upon the default of all of our independent retailers whose inventories are subject to repurchase agreements  without reduction for the resale value of the repurchased homes

we are also required to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio as defined of not less than to the interest coverage ratio is the ratio of our consolidated ebitda for the four quarter period then ended to our cash interest expense as defined over the same four quarter period 
in addition  annual mandatory prepayments are required should we generate excess cash flow as defined 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
however  scheduled decreases in the leverage covenant coupled with lower expected levels of ebitda as defined  particularly in the first quarter of  make it unlikely that we will remain in compliance 
as a result  we have initiated discussions with our lenders for purposes of amending the credit agreement 
the senior notes due are secured equally and ratably with our obligations under the restated credit agreement 
interest is payable semi annually at an annual rate of 
the indenture governing the senior notes due contains covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and incur liens on assets 
we continuously evaluate our capital structure 
strategies considered to improve our capital structure include without limitation  purchasing  refinancing  exchanging  or otherwise retiring our outstanding indebtedness  restructuring of obligations  new financings  and issuances of securities  whether in the open market or by other means and to the extent permitted by our existing financing arrangements 
we evaluate all potential transactions in light of existing and expected market conditions 
the amounts involved in any such transactions  individually or in the aggregate  may be material 
we expect to spend less than million in on capital expenditures 
we do not plan to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the near term 
we may use a portion of our cash balances and or incur additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions of businesses 
contingent liabilities and obligations we had significant contingent liabilities and obligations at december   including surety bonds and letters of credit totaling million and guarantees of million of debt of unconsolidated affiliates 
additionally  we are contingently obligated under repurchase agreements with certain lending institutions that provide floor plan financing to our independent retailers 
we estimate our contingent repurchase obligation as of december  was approximately million  without reduction for the resale value of the homes 
see contingent repurchase obligations manufacturing segment discussed above in item of this report 
we have provided various representations  warranties and other standard indemnifications in the ordinary course of our business  in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements 
we are also subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
management believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent liabilities and obligations will not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
summary of liquidity and capital resources at december   our unrestricted cash balances totaled million and we had unused availability of million under our revolving credit facility 
therefore  total cash available from these sources was 
table of contents approximately million 
we expect that our cash flow from operations for the next two years will be adequate to fund capital expenditures during that period as well as the approximately million of scheduled debt payments due in and therefore  the level of cash availability is projected to be in excess of cash needed to operate our businesses for the next two years 
we may use a portion of our cash balances and or incur additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions of businesses 
in the event that our operating cash flow is inadequate and one or more of our capital resources were to become unavailable  we would revise our operating strategies accordingly 
as of december   we were in compliance with all term loan covenants 
however  as a result of scheduled decreases in the leverage covenant coupled with lower forecasted results due to us housing market conditions  we will likely be unable to remain in compliance with the current covenants during we have initiated discussions with the lenders to obtain an amendment to the restated credit agreement 
the inability to secure a satisfactory amendment to the restated credit agreement could result in a demand from the lenders to repay all or a portion of the term loans and the termination of the letter of credit and revolving line of credit facilities 
in the event we fail to obtain a satisfactory amendment  we would seek to refinance the related indebtedness 
contractual obligations the following table presents a summary of payments due by period for our contractual obligations for long term debt  capital leases  operating leases  and certain other long term liabilities as of december  payments due by period after december  total years in thousands long term debt senior notes due term loans due obligations under industrial revenue bonds capital leases and other debt operating leases total the maturity date for each of the term loans is october   unless as of february   more than million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due are outstanding  then the maturity date will be february  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
assumptions and estimates of future earnings and cash flow are used in the periodic analyses of the recoverability of goodwill  intangible assets  deferred tax assets and property  plant and equipment 
historical experience and trends are used to estimate reserves  including reserves for self insured risks  warranty costs and wholesale repurchase losses 
following is a description of each accounting policy requiring significant judgments and estimates reserves for self insured risks we are self insured for a significant portion of our workers compensation  general and products liability  auto liability  health and property insurance 
under our current self insurance programs  we are generally responsible for up to million per claim for workers compensation million per claim in california and automobile 
table of contents liability claims  up to million  million or million per claim for product liability and general liability claims  depending on the policy year under which the claim is made and up to million per claim for property insurance claims including business interruption losses 
we maintain excess liability and property insurance with independent insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims 
under our current self insurance program we are responsible for up to  of health insurance claims per contract per year 
estimated casualty and health insurance costs are accrued for incurred claims and estimated claims incurred but not yet reported 
factors considered in estimating our insurance reserves are the nature of outstanding claims including the severity of the claims  estimated costs to settle existing claims  loss history and inflation  as well as estimates provided by our third party actuaries 
significant changes in the factors described above could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
warranty reserves our manufacturing operations generally provide the retail homebuyer or the builder developer with a twelve month warranty 
estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time of sale 
our warranty reserve is based on estimates of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on homes sold by the manufacturing operations as of the balance sheet date 
factors used to calculate the warranty obligation are the estimated number of homes still under warranty  including homes in retailer inventories and homes purchased by consumers still within the twelve month warranty period and the historical average costs incurred to service a home 
significant changes in these factors could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
property  plant and equipment the recoverability of property  plant and equipment is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable  primarily based on estimated selling prices  appraised values or projected undiscounted cash flows 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted for estimated current industry trends  the economy and operating conditions 
additionally  we use estimates of fair market values to establish impairment reserves for permanently closed facilities that are held for sale 
past evaluations of property  plant and equipment have resulted in significant impairment charges primarily for closed manufacturing facilities and retail sales centers 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could result in additional impairment charges in the future 
income taxes and deferred tax assets deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement balances and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we periodically evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on the requirements established in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recording of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
effective july   we reversed substantially all of the previously recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets after determining that realization of the deferred tax assets was more likely than not 
this determination was based upon achieving historical profitability and our outlook for ongoing profitability  among other factors 
projections of future profitability and levels of taxable income are required in assessing deferred tax assets and involve significant estimates and assumptions 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could result in the need to establish a valuation allowance for all or part of our deferred tax assets again in the future 
goodwill and amortizable intangible assets goodwill and amortizable intangible assets are related to both our manufacturing and international segments 
we test for impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we test for impairment of amortizable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate the fair value of our manufacturing and international segments versus their carrying value as of each fiscal year end or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value 
when estimating the segment s fair value  we calculate the present value of future cash flows based on forecasted sales volumes and profit margins the number 
table of contents of manufacturing facilities in operation  current industry and economic conditions  historical results and inflation 
we also use available market value information to evaluate fair value 
significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the segments and the recoverability of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets  or differences between estimates and actual results could result in impairment charges in the future 
wholesale repurchase reserves approximately of our manufacturing sales to independent retailers are made pursuant to repurchase agreements with the providers of floor plan financing 
we determine our repurchase reserves based on the greater of the fair value of the guaranty made under the repurchase agreements and an estimate of losses for homes expected to be repurchased based on historical repurchase experience 
an additional reserve is established for estimated losses related to specific retailer defaults that are deemed to be probable 
losses under repurchase obligations are determined by calculating the difference between the repurchase price and the estimated net resale value of the homes  less accrued rebates which will not be paid 
estimated losses under repurchase agreements are based on the historical number of homes repurchased  the cost of such repurchases and the historical losses incurred  as well as the current inventory levels held at our independent retailers 
in addition  we monitor the risks associated with our independent retailers and consider these risks in identifying probable retailer defaults 
significant changes in these factors could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
revenue recognition the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition is used for certain construction contracts 
this method of accounting requires estimates and assumptions as to total costs and profitability for each contract 
actual results could vary significantly from these estimates resulting in significant adjustments to reported income 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on our operations during the last three years 
commodity prices  including lumber  fluctuate  however  during periods of rising commodity prices we have generally been able to pass the increased costs to our customers in the form of surcharges and price increases 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation number fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin is effective beginning with our fiscal year 
fin clarifies accounting for uncertain tax positions utilizing a more likely than not recognition threshold for tax positions 
we will initially recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits of the tax position  that such a position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities 
if the tax benefit meets the more likely than not threshold  the measurement of the tax benefit will be based on the company s best estimate of the ultimate tax benefit that will be sustained if audited by the taxing authority 
the adoption by the company of fin in the first quarter of is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations  but will result in additional disclosures in the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our debt obligations under the restated credit agreement are currently subject to variable rates of interest based on both us and uk libor 
a basis point increase in the underlying interest rate would result in an additional annual interest cost of approximately million  assuming average related debt of million  which was the amount of outstanding borrowings at december  our obligations under industrial revenue bonds are subject to variable rates of interest based on short term tax exempt rate indices 
a basis point increase in the underlying interest rates would result in additional annual interest cost of approximately  assuming average related debt of million  which was the amount of outstanding borrowings at december  
table of contents our approach to interest rate risk is to balance our borrowings between fixed rate and variable rate debt 
at december   we had million of senior notes at a fixed rate and million of term notes at a variable rate 
at december   we had million of senior notes at a fixed rate and million of term notes at a variable rate 
we are exposed to foreign exchange risk with our factory built housing operations in canada and our international segment in the uk 
our canadian operations had net sales totaling can million 
assuming future annual canadian sales equal to sales  a change of in exchange rates between the us and canadian dollars would change consolidated sales by million 
our international segment had annualized sales of million pounds sterling 
assuming future annual uk sales equal to annualized sales  a change of in exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound sterling would change consolidated sales by million 
net income of the canadian and uk operations would also be affected by changes in exchange rates 
we borrowed million in the us to finance a portion of the caledonian purchase price which totaled approximately million 
this sterling denominated borrowing was designated as an economic hedge of our net investment in the uk 
therefore a significant portion of foreign exchange risk related to our caledonian investment in the uk is offset 
we do not attempt to manage foreign exchange risk that relates to our investment in the canadian operations
