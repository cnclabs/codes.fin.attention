item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
executive summary of consolidated results of operations year ended december  in millions  except per share data net income attributed to utility group nonutility group corporate other basic earnings per share attributed to utility group nonutility group corporate other results for the year ended december   reported earnings were million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  in and million  or per share  in the decline in results compared to is primarily attributable to the decline in synfuels results of per share  a per share charge related to the settlement of a lawsuit involving proliance energy  llc proliance and continued declines in customer usage 
losses associated with synfuels related activities were per share in  compared to earnings of per share in and earnings of per share in excluding the results from synfuel related activities  earnings in were per share compared to per share in and per share in utility group results reflect the impact of a constructive regulatory environment 
the company received orders in the fourth quarter of that authorize lost margin recovery related to the company s ohio customers and a majority of indiana natural gas customers  and an order in the fourth quarter of for a normal temperature adjustment mechanism with respect to the company s indiana natural gas customers 
the company also utilizes rider mechanisms to recover capital expenditures associated with compliance with clean air act and clean air mercury requirements  among other costs 
in addition  the company has implemented base rate increases since and currently has two cases before the iurc where orders are expected in the revenue increases  including the proposed increases in the two pending cases  are required to offset increased operating and financing costs  the effect on usage from higher commodity prices  and the impact of recent weather unfavorable compared to year normal temperatures 
gas utility base rate increases added revenues of approximately million in compared to  and million in compared to increased revenues associated with recovery of pollution control investments were million in compared to and million in compared to increased revenues associated with lost margin recovery were million in compared to in compared to  the decline in utility group earnings is primarily the result of continued declines in customer usage  higher depreciation and interest costs  and wholesale power marketing margins million  or million after tax  lower than the prior year 
the decline was mitigated somewhat by the implementation of regulatory initiatives noted above  the impact of a lower effective tax rate  and a gain realized on the sale of a storage asset 
in compared to  the per share earnings increase is largely due to increased base rates  recovery of pollution control investments  weather  and wholesale power marketing activities 
the improved utility margins were partially offset by higher operating and depreciation expense 
the results also reflect a million  million after tax  charge recorded pursuant to the disallowance of ohio gas costs 
in   and weather across all utilities was unfavorable compared to year normal temperatures 
management estimates the effect of weather compared to normal was unfavorable per share in  unfavorable per share in  and unfavorable per share in the weather effect contains the full impact of a normal temperature adjustment nta mechanism implemented in the company s indiana natural gas service territories in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents the utility group generates revenue primarily from the delivery of natural gas and electric service to its customers 
the primary source of cash flow for the utility group results from the collection of customer bills and the payment for goods and services procured for the delivery of gas and electric services 
the results of the utility group are impacted by weather patterns in its service territory and general economic conditions both in its indiana and ohio service territories as well as nationally 
primary nonutility operations include energy marketing and services companies  coal mining operations  and energy infrastructure services companies 
energy marketing and services contributed earnings of million in  million in  and million in results in and contain costs associated with the settlement of a lawsuit involving proliance 
the company s portion of those costs totaled million after tax in and million after tax in coal mining operations contributed earnings of million in  million in  and million in energy infrastructure services contributed earnings of million in  million in  and million in in total and excluding the effects of the lawsuit involving proliance  the company s primary nonutility business groups contributed earnings of million  a decrease of million compared to earnings from proliance  which are included in energy marketing and services results  decreased million year over year due largely to record earnings in proliance s earnings in increased significantly due to larger spreads between financial and physical markets  which resulted from market disruptions caused by gulf coast hurricanes 
the earnings decrease was offset by results from energy infrastructure services companies  which include energy systems group and miller pipeline 
they contributed additional earnings of million and million respectively 
earnings growth  excluding the effects of the lawsuit  in compared to totaled million and was primarily driven by increased earnings from proliance and improved coal mining operations 
effective july   the company purchased the remaining ownership in miller pipeline corporation miller  making miller a wholly owned subsidiary 
prior to this transaction  miller was a owned joint venture accounted for using the equity method 
the results of miller s operations have been included in consolidated results since july  while the acquisition of miller is not expected to have a material impact on the overall financial statements  consolidating miller resulted in  among other impacts  a million increase in nonutility revenues and a million increase in other operating expense in when compared to the transaction also increased consolidated goodwill by approximately million and intangible assets  which are included in other assets  by million 
results from other nonutility businesses  which were losses of million in  income of million in and losses of million in  were primarily affected by the company s broadband investments and its investment in haddington energy partners 
in  the company sold its investment in sigecom  llc to a third party at a loss of approximately million 
the year ended december  also reflects after tax charges totaling million associated with sigecom  llc and other broadband related investments 
earnings associated with haddington  which sold investments in and at net gains  totaled million in  compared to million in and million in 
table of contents finally  and separate from the ongoing operations  synfuels related results  inclusive of the expected phase out of tax credits  the impairment of synfuel related assets  the related hedging activity  the impact of insurance contracts and processing fees  resulted in losses of million in mark to market losses associated with financial contracts hedging production recognized in totaled million 
earnings from synfuels related activities were million in and million in the nonutility group generates revenue or earnings from the provision of services to customers 
the activities of the nonutility group are closely linked to the utility industry  and the results of those operations are generally impacted by factors similar to those impacting the overall utility industry 
the corporate and other loss per share reflects an additional contribution to the vectren foundation of million  or million after tax  to sustain its giving program over the next several years 
the contribution is included in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
in this discussion and analysis of results of operations  the results of the utility group and nonutility group are presented on a per share basis 
such per share amounts are based on the earnings contribution of each group included in vectren s consolidated results divided by vectren s average shares outstanding during the period 
the earnings per share of the groups do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to either group but rather represent a direct equity interest in vectren corporation s assets and liabilities as a whole 
the company has in place a disclosure committee that consists of senior management as well as financial management 
the committee is actively involved in the preparation and review of the company s sec filings 
dividends dividends declared for the year ended december   were per share compared to per share in and per share in in october  the company s board of directors increased its quarterly dividend to per share from per share 
detailed discussion of results of operations following is a more detailed discussion of the results of operations of the company s utility and nonutility operations 
the detailed results of operations for these operations are presented and analyzed before the reclassification and elimination of certain intersegment transactions necessary to consolidate those results into the company s consolidated statements of income 
other than the million contribution made in to the vectren foundation discussed above  corporate and other operations are not significant 

table of contents results of operations of the utility group utility operations are comprised of vectren utility holdings  inc s operations  which consist of the company s regulated operations and other operations that provide information technology and other support services to those regulated operations 
the company segregates its regulated operations into a gas utility services operating segment and an electric utility services operating segment 
the gas utility services segment provides natural gas distribution and transportation services to nearly two thirds of indiana and to west central ohio 
the electric utility services segment provides electric distribution services primarily to southwestern indiana  and includes the company s power generating and asset optimization operations 
in total  these regulated operations supply natural gas and or electricity to more than one million customers 
the results of operations of the utility group before certain intersegment eliminations and reclassifications for the years ended december    and  follow year ended december  in millions  except per share data operating revenues gas utility electric utility other total operating revenues operating expenses cost of gas sold cost of fuel purchased power other operating depreciation amortization taxes other than income taxes total operating expenses operating income other income equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates other net total other income interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income basic earnings per share significant fluctuations utility group margin throughout this discussion  the terms gas utility margin and electric utility margin are used 
gas utility margin is calculated as gas utility revenues less the cost of gas sold 
electric utility margin is calculated as electric utility revenues less the cost of fuel purchased power 
the company believes gas utility and electric utility margins are better indicators of relative contribution than revenues since gas prices and fuel costs can be volatile and are generally collected on a dollar for dollar basis from customers 
these measures exclude other operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  and taxes other than income taxes  which are included in the calculation of operating income 
margin generated from the sale of natural gas and electricity to residential and commercial customers is seasonal and is impacted by weather patterns in the company s service territories 
the weather impact in the company s indiana gas utility service territories is mitigated by a normal temperature adjustment mechanism  which was implemented in the fourth quarter of margin generated from sales to large customers generally industrial  other contract  and firm wholesale customers is primarily impacted by overall economic conditions 
margin is also impacted by the collection of state mandated taxes  which fluctuate with gas costs  as well as other tracked expenses and is also impacted by some level of price sensitivity in volumes sold or delivered 
electric generating asset optimization activities are primarily affected by market conditions  the level of excess generating capacity  and electric transmission availability 
following is a discussion and analysis of margin generated from regulated utility operations 

table of contents gas utility margin gas utility revenues less cost of gas sold gas utility margin and throughput by customer type follows year ended december  in millions gas utility revenues cost of gas sold total gas utility margin margin attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers other customers sold transported volumes in mmdth attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers total sold transported volumes gas utility margins were million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to a full year of base rate increases implemented in the company s ohio service territory which increased margin million  a million disallowance of ohio gas costs in  the effects of the normal temperature adjustment mechanism nta implemented in in the company s indiana service territories  and the lost margin recovery authorization implemented in the fourth quarter of  more than offset the effects of warm weather  lower usage  and decreased tracked expenses recovered dollar for dollar in margin 
for the year ended december   compared to  management estimates that weather percent warmer than normal and percent warmer than prior year would have decreased margins million compared to the prior year  had the nta not been in effect 
weather  net of the nta  resulted in an approximate million year over year increase in gas utility margin 
incremental revenue associated with the lost margin recovery totaled million in further  for the year ended december   margin associated with tracked expenses and revenue taxes decreased million 
the average cost per dekatherm of gas purchased for the year ended december   was compared to in and in for the year ended december   gas utility margins increased million compared to the increase is primarily due to the favorable impact of gas base rate increases of million and additional pass through expenses and revenue taxes recovered in margins of million compared to results for the year ended december   reflect the disallowance of ohio gas costs ordered by the puco described above 
for the year ended december   weather was warmer than normal but colder than the prior year 
management estimates that weather  including the effects of the normal temperature adjustment mechanism  increased margin an estimated million compared to 
table of contents electric utility margin electric utility revenues less cost of fuel and purchased power electric utility margin and volumes sold by customer type follows year ended december  in millions electric utility revenues cost of fuel purchased power total electric utility margin margin attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers municipal other customers subtotal retail firm wholesale asset optimization electric volumes sold in gwh attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers municipal other customers total retail firm wholesale volumes sold retail firm wholesale margin electric retail and firm wholesale utility margin was million for the year ended december  and was generally flat compared to the recovery of pollution control related investments and associated operating expenses and related depreciation increased margins million year over year 
higher demand charges and other items increased industrial customer margin approximately million year over year 
these increases were offset by decreased residential and commercial usage 
the decreased usage was due primarily to mild weather during the peak cooling season 
for compared to  the estimated decrease in margin due to unfavorable weather was million million for below normal cooling weather and million for heating weather 
during  cooling degree days were below normal 
in  cooling degree days were above normal 
electric retail and firm wholesale utility margin increased million in compared to the recovery of pollution control related investments and associated operating expenses and depreciation expense increased margins million compared to cooling weather was warmer than normal and warmer than in compared to  the estimated increase in electric margin related to weather was million million related to cooling weather and million related to heating weather 
margin from asset optimization activities periodically  generation capacity is in excess of that needed to serve retail load and firm wholesale customers 
the company markets this unutilized capacity to optimize the return on its owned generation assets 
these optimization strategies primarily involve the sale of excess generation into the miso day ahead and real time markets 
as part of these strategies  the company may also execute energy contracts that are integrated with portfolio requirements around power supply and delivery 
asset optimization activity is comprised of the following year ended december  in millions off system sales transmission system sales other total asset optimization 
table of contents for the year ended december   net asset optimization margins were million  which represents a decrease of million compared to the decrease is due to the effect lower wholesale prices have had on the company s optimization portfolio and lower volumes sold off system 
for the year ended december   net asset optimization margins increased million as compared to the increase in margin results primarily from the timing of available capacity and mark to market gains 
in  the company experienced increased availability of the generating units 
the availability of excess capacity was reduced in and by scheduled outages of owned generation related to the installation of environmental compliance equipment 
off system sales totaled gwh in  compared to  gwh in and gwh in utility group operating expenses other operating for the year ended december   other operating expenses decreased million compared to expenses in are reduced from the inclusion of a gain on the sale of a storage asset of approximately million 
excluding this gain  operating expenses would have increased million compared to the increase is primarily the result of electric generation chemical costs million higher than the prior year 
bad debt expense in the company s indiana service territories increased million year over year due in part to higher gas costs 
other operating expenses increased million for the year ended december   compared to amortization of rate case expenses  expenses associated with the ohio choice program and integrity management programs  and expenses recovered through margin increased million 
bad debt expense in the company s indiana service territories was million in  an increase of million compared to compensation and benefit costs increases  including performance and share based compensation was million higher than the prior year  reflective of the return to higher earnings in as compared to higher maintenance  chemical costs  and all other costs account for million of the increase 
depreciation amortization depreciation expense increased million in compared to and million in compared to in addition to depreciation on additions to plant in service  the increases were primarily due to incremental depreciation expense associated with environmental compliance equipment additions 
depreciation expense associated with environmental compliance equipment  which is recovered in electric utility margin  totaled million in  million in  and million in results for include million of lower depreciation due to adjustments of ohio depreciation rates and amortization of indiana regulatory assets 
taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes decreased million for the year ended december   compared to and increased million in compared to the fluctuations are primarily attributable to variations in the collection of utility receipts  excise  and usage taxes 
these variations resulted primarily from volatility in revenues and gas volumes sold 
utility group other income expense total other income expense net increased million in compared to  and decreased million in compared to the fluctuations relate primarily to capitalized interest on utility plant additions 
utility group interest expense in  interest expense increased million compared to and increased million in compared to the increases are primarily driven by rising interest rates and higher levels of short term borrowings due in part to higher working capital requirements resulting from the increased gas commodity prices 

table of contents interest costs in also include the full impact of permanent financing transactions completed in the fourth quarter of in which million in debt related proceeds were received and used to retire short term borrowings and other long term debt 
results for also include a partial impact from financing transactions completed in october in which approximately million in debt related proceeds were raised and used to retire debt outstanding with a higher interest rate 
utility group income taxes federal and state income taxes decreased million in compared to and increased million in compared to the changes are impacted by fluctuations in pre tax income 
income taxes recorded in reflect a million favorable impact for an indiana tax law change that resulted in the recalculation of certain state deferred income tax liabilities 
income taxes in also include other adjustments  including adjustments to reflect income taxes reported on state and federal income tax returns 
income taxes recorded in reflect favorable adjustments to accruals resulting from the conclusion of state tax audits and other adjustments 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  and local regulations with respect to environmental matters  principally air  solid waste  and water quality 
pursuant to environmental regulations  the company is required to obtain operating permits for the electric generating plants that it owns or operates and construction permits for any new plants it might propose to build 
regulations concerning air quality establish standards with respect to both ambient air quality and emissions from electric generating facilities  including particulate matter  sulfur dioxide so  nitrogen oxide nox  and mercury 
regulations concerning water quality establish standards relating to intake and discharge of water from electric generating facilities  including water used for cooling purposes in electric generating facilities 
because of the scope and complexity of these regulations  the company is unable to predict the ultimate effect of such regulations on its future operations  nor is it possible to predict what other regulations may be adopted in the future  including any regulations to address the climate change issue 
clean air act clean air interstate rule clean air mercury rule in march of usepa finalized two new air emission reduction regulations 
the clean air interstate rule cair is an allowance cap and trade program requiring further reductions in nitrogen oxides nox and sulfur dioxide so emissions from coal burning power plants 
the clean air mercury rule camr is an allowance cap and trade program requiring further reductions in mercury emissions from coal burning power plants 
both sets of regulations require emission reductions in two phases 
the first phase deadline for both rules is for nox under cair  and the second phase deadline for compliance with the emission reductions required under cair is  while the second phase deadline for compliance with the emission reduction requirements of camr is the company is evaluating compliance options and fully expects to be in compliance by the required deadlines 
in february  the iurc approved a multi emission compliance plan filed by the company s utility subsidiary  sigeco 
once the plan is implemented  sigeco s coal fired plants will be scrubbed for so  scrubbed for nox  and mercury emissions will be reduced to meet the new mercury reduction standards 
the order  as previously agreed to by the oucc and citizens action coalition  allows sigeco to recover an approximate return on up to million in capital investments through a rider mechanism which is updated every six months for actual costs incurred 
the company will also recover through a rider its operating expenses  including depreciation  once the equipment is placed into service 
the order also stipulates that sigeco study renewable energy alternatives and include a carbon forecast in future filings with regard to new generation and further environmental compliance plans  among other initiatives 
as of december   the company has made capital investments of approximately million related to this environmental requirement 
nox sip call matter the company complied with indiana s state implementation plan sip of the clean air act the act 
these steps included installation of selective catalytic reduction scr systems at culley generating station unit culley  warrick generating station unit  and a 
b 
brown generating station units and scr systems reduce flue gas nox emissions to atmospheric nitrogen and water using ammonia in a chemical reaction 
this technology is known to currently be the most effective method of reducing nitrogen oxide nox emissions where high removal efficiencies are required 

table of contents the iurc issued orders that approved the company s project to achieve environmental compliance by investing in clean coal technology  the company s investment of million in capital costs  a mechanism whereby  prior to an electric base rate case  the company recovers through a rider that is updated every six months  an return on its weighted capital costs for the project  and ongoing recovery of operating costs  including depreciation and purchased emission allowances  related to the clean coal technology now that facilities are placed into service 
related annual operating expenses  including depreciation expense  were million in  million in  and million in culley generating station litigation during  the us district court for the southern district of indiana entered a consent decree among sigeco  the department of justice doj  and the usepa that resolved a lawsuit originally brought by the usepa against sigeco 
the lawsuit alleged violations of the clean air act by sigeco at its culley generating station for making modifications to a generating station without obtaining required permits  making major modifications to the generating station without installing the best available emission control technology  and failing to notify the usepa of the modifications 
under the terms of the agreement  the doj and usepa agreed to drop all challenges of past maintenance and repair activities at the culley generating station 
in reaching the agreement  sigeco did not admit to any allegations in the government s complaint  and sigeco continues to believe that it acted in accordance with applicable regulations and conducted only routine maintenance on the units 
sigeco entered into this agreement to further its continued commitment to improve air quality and avoid the cost and uncertainties of litigation 
under the agreement  sigeco committed to either repower culley unit mw with natural gas and equip it with scr control technology for further reduction of nitrogen oxide  or cease operation of the unit by december   operate the existing scr control technology recently installed on culley unit mw year round at a lower emission rate than that currently required under the nox sip call  resulting in further nitrogen oxide reductions  enhance the efficiency of the existing scrubber at culley units and for additional removal of sulphur dioxide emissions  install a baghouse for further particulate matter reductions at culley unit by june   conduct a sulphuric acid reduction demonstration project as an environmental mitigation project designed to demonstrate an advance in pollution control technology for the reduction of sulfate emissions  and pay a  civil penalty 
the company does not believe that implementation of the settlement will have a material effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
the  civil penalty was expensed and paid during the company ceased operation of culley unit effective december  and the baghouse  which is included in the million iurc order discussed above  went into service january  manufactured gas plants in the past  indiana gas  sigeco  and others operated facilities for the manufacture of gas 
given the availability of natural gas transported by pipelines  these facilities have not been operated for many years 
under currently applicable environmental laws and regulations  those that operated these facilities may now be required to take remedial action if certain byproducts are found above the regulatory thresholds at these sites 
indiana gas identified the existence  location  and certain general characteristics of gas manufacturing and storage sites for which it may have some remedial responsibility 
indiana gas completed a remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs at one of the sites under an agreed order between indiana gas and the idem  and a record of decision was issued by the idem in january although indiana gas has not begun an ri fs at additional sites  indiana gas has submitted several of the sites to the idem s voluntary remediation program vrp and is currently conducting some level of remedial activities  including groundwater monitoring at certain sites  where deemed appropriate  and will continue remedial activities at the sites as appropriate and necessary 

table of contents in conjunction with data compiled by environmental consultants  indiana gas accrued the estimated costs for further investigation  remediation  groundwater monitoring  and related costs for the sites 
while the total costs that may be incurred in connection with addressing these sites cannot be determined at this time  indiana gas has recorded costs that it reasonably expects to incur totaling approximately million 
the estimated accrued costs are limited to indiana gas proportionate share of the remediation efforts 
indiana gas has arrangements in place for of the sites with other potentially responsible parties prp  which serve to limit indiana gas share of response costs at these sites to between and 
with respect to insurance coverage  indiana gas has received and recorded settlements from all known insurance carriers in an aggregate amount approximating million 
in october  sigeco received a formal information request letter from the idem regarding five manufactured gas plants that it owned and or operated and were not enrolled in the idem s vrp 
in response  sigeco submitted to the idem the results of preliminary site investigations conducted in the mid s 
these site investigations confirmed that based upon the conditions known at the time  the sites posed no imminent and or substantial risk to human health or the environment 
on october   sigeco filed applications to enter four of the manufactured gas plant sites in idem s vrp 
the remaining site is currently being addressed in the vrp by another indiana utility 
sigeco added those four sites into the renewal of the global voluntary remediation agreement that indiana gas has in place with idem for its manufactured gas plant sites 
that renewal was approved by the idem on february  on july   sigeco filed a declaratory judgment action against its insurance carriers seeking a judgment finding its carriers liable under the policies for coverage of further investigation and any necessary remediation costs that sigeco may accrue under the vrp program 
while the total costs that may be incurred in connection with addressing these sites cannot be determined at this time  sigeco has recorded costs that it reasonably expects to incur totaling approximately million 
with respect to insurance coverage  sigeco has received and recorded settlements from insurance carriers in an aggregate amount approximating the costs it expects to incur 
environmental matters related to indiana gas and sigeco s manufactured gas plants have had no material impact on results of operations or financial condition since costs recorded to date approximate prp and insurance settlement recoveries 
while the company s utilities have recorded all costs which they presently expect to incur in connection with activities at these sites  it is possible that future events may require some level of additional remedial activities which are not presently foreseen 
jacobsville superfund site on july   the usepa listed the jacobsville neighborhood soil contamination site in evansville  indiana  on the national priorities list under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
the usepa has identified four sources of historic lead contamination 
these four sources shut down manufacturing operations years ago 
when drawing up the boundaries for the listing  the usepa included a acre block of properties surrounding the jacobsville neighborhood  including vectren s wagner operations center 
vectren s property has not been named as a source of the lead contamination  nor does the usepa s soil testing to date indicate that the vectren property contains lead contaminated soils 
vectren s own soil testing  completed during the construction of the operations center  did not indicate that the vectren property contains lead contaminated soils 
at this time  vectren anticipates only additional soil testing  if required by the usepa 

table of contents global climate change global climate change remains a policy issue that is regularly considered for government regulation 
if legislation requiring reductions in greenhouses gases is adopted  such regulation could substantially affect both the costs and operating characteristics of the company s fossil fuel plants 
further  the company s nonutility coal mining operations may be adversely affected 
rate and regulatory matters gas and electric operations with regard to retail rates and charges  terms of service  accounting matters  issuance of securities  and certain other operational matters specific to its indiana customers are regulated by the iurc 
the retail gas operations of the ohio operations are subject to regulation by the puco 
all metered gas rates in indiana contain a gas cost adjustment gca clause  and all metered gas rates in ohio contain a gas cost recovery gcr clause 
gca and gcr clauses allow the company to charge for changes in the cost of purchased gas 
metered electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause fac that allows for adjustment in charges for electric energy to reflect changes in the cost of fuel 
the net energy cost of purchased power  subject to an agreed upon benchmark  is also recovered through regulatory proceedings 
gca  gcr  and fac procedures involve periodic filings and iurc and puco hearings to establish the amount of price adjustments for a designated future period 
the procedures also provide for inclusion in later periods of any variances between the estimated cost of gas  cost of fuel  and net energy cost of purchased power and actual costs incurred 
the company records any under or over recovery resulting from gas and fuel adjustment clauses each month in margin 
a corresponding asset or liability is recorded until the under or over recovery is billed or refunded to utility customers 
the iurc has also applied the statute authorizing gca and fac procedures to reduce rates when necessary to limit net operating income to a level authorized in its last general rate order through the application of an earnings test 
for the recent past  the earnings test has not affected the company s ability to recover costs 
ohio and indiana lost margin recovery conservation filings in  the company filed conservation programs and conservation adjustment trackers in indiana and ohio designed to help customers conserve energy and reduce their annual gas bills 
the programs would allow the company to recover costs of promoting the conservation of natural gas through conservation trackers that work in tandem with a lost margin recovery mechanism 
this mechanism is designed to allow the company to recover the distribution portion of its rates from residential and commercial customers based on the level of customer revenues established in each utility s last general rate case 
indiana in december  the iurc approved a settlement agreement between the company and the oucc that provides for a year energy efficiency program to be implemented 
the order allows the company s indiana utilities to recover the costs of promoting the conservation of natural gas through conservation trackers that work in tandem with a lost margin recovery mechanism that would provide for recovery of of the difference between revenues actually collected by the company and the revenues approved in the company s most recent rate case 
the order was implemented in the north service territory in december and will be implemented in south s service territory after its next general rate case see below 
while most expenses associated with these programs are recoverable  in the first program year  the company is required to fund million in program costs without recovery 
revenues recorded in as a result of this order related to lost margin recovery totaled million and revenues to fund energy efficiency programs totaled million 
ohio in september  the puco approved a conservation proposal that would implement a decoupling approach  including a related conservation program  for the company s ohio operations 
the puco decision was issued following a hearing process and the submission of a settlement by the company  the ohio consumer counselor occ and the ohio partners for affordable energy opae 
that settlement was contested by the puco staff 
in the decision the puco addressed decoupling by approving a two year  million total  low income conservation program to be funded by the company  as well as a sales reconciliation rider intended to be a recovery mechanism for the difference between the weather normalized revenues actually collected by the company and the revenues approved by the puco in the company s most recent rate case 
the decision produced an outcome that was different from the settlement 
following the decision  the company and the opae advised the puco that they would accept the outcome even though it differed from the terms of the settlement 
the occ sought rehearing of the decision  which was denied in december  and thereafter the occ advised the puco that the occ was withdrawing from the settlement 
at that point the occ also initiated the process for appealing the puco s september and december decisions to the ohio supreme court 
thereafter  the company  the opae and the puco staff advised the puco that they accepted the terms provided in the september decision  as affirmed by the december rehearing decision 
since that time there have been a number of procedural filings by the parties and presently the company is awaiting a further decision from the puco 
the company believes that the puco had the necessary legal basis for its decisions and thus should confirm the outcome provided in the september decision 
the company began recognizing the impact of this order on october   and has recorded revenues in related to the order in the amount of million 

table of contents vectren south southern indiana gas electric base rate filings on september   vectren south filed petitions with the iurc to adjust its electric and gas base rates in its south service territory 
the electric petition requests an increase of million in base rates to recover the nearly million additional investment in electric utility infrastructure since its last base rate increase in  which is not currently included in rates charged to customers 
the increase in rates also is required to support system growth  maintenance  reliability and recovery of costs deferred under previous iurc orders 
the gas petition seeks to increase its gas base non gas cost rates by million to cover the ongoing costs of operating and maintaining its natural gas distribution and storage system 
based upon the timelines prescribed by the iurc at the start of these proceedings  decisions in each case are expected to be issued in the late summer of the initial public hearings in both cases have been conducted 
on january   the oucc filed testimony in the gas rate case proposing an increase of million 
igcc certificate of public convenience and necessity on september   vectren energy delivery of indiana and duke energy indiana  inc filed with the iurc a joint petition for a certificate of public convenience and necessity cpcn for the construction of new electric capacity 
specifically  vectren requested the iurc approve its construction and ownership of up to of an integrated gasification combined cycle igcc project 
vectren s cpcn filing also seeks timely recovery of its portion of the project s construction costs as well as operation and maintenance costs and additional incentives available for the construction of clean coal technology 
initial studies of plant design have already begun  and if the project moves forward as currently designed  plant construction is expected to begin in and continue through weather normalization on october   the iurc approved the establishment of a normal temperature adjustment nta mechanism for vectren energy delivery of indiana 
the oucc had previously entered into a settlement agreement with vectren energy delivery of indiana providing for the nta 
the nta affects the company s indiana regulated residential and commercial natural gas customers and should mitigate weather risk in those customer classes during the october to april heating season 
these indiana customer classes represent approximately of the company s total natural gas heating load 
the nta mechanism will mitigate volatility in distribution charges created by fluctuations in weather by lowering customer bills when weather is colder than normal and increasing customer bills when weather is warmer than normal 
the nta has been applied to meters read and bills rendered after october  each subsequent monthly bill for the seven month heating season will be adjusted using the nta 
resulting from this order  revenues recorded in totaled million while refunds of million were made in the order provides that the company will make  on a monthly basis  a commitment of  to a universal service fund program or other low income assistance program for the duration of the nta or until a general rate case 

table of contents rate structures in the company s indiana electric territory and ohio gas territory do not include weather normalization type clauses 
gas utility base rate settlements in and on june   the iurc approved a million base rate increase for sigeco s gas distribution business  and on november   approved a million base rate increase for indiana gas gas distribution business 
on april   the puco approved a million base rate increase for vedo s gas distribution business 
the base rate change in sigeco s service territory was implemented on july   the base rate change in indiana gas service territory was implemented on december   and the base rate change in vedo s service territory was implemented on april  the orders also permit sigeco and indiana gas to recover the on going costs to comply with the pipeline safety improvement act of the pipeline safety improvement tracker provides for the recovery of incremental non capital dollars  capped at  the first year and  thereafter for sigeco and million per year for indiana gas 
any costs incurred in excess of these annual caps are to be deferred for future recovery 
vedo s new base rates provide for the recovery of some level of on going costs to comply with the pipeline safety improvement act of miso since february and with the iurc s approval  the company has been a member of the midwest independent system operator  inc miso  a ferc approved regional transmission organization 
the miso serves the electrical transmission needs of much of the midwest and maintains operational control over the company s electric transmission facilities as well as that of other midwest utilities 
pursuant to an order from the iurc received in december  certain miso startup costs referred to as day costs have been deferred for future recovery in the next general rate case  which was filed in on april   the miso energy market commenced operation the day energy market 
as a result of being a market participant  the company now bids its owned generation into the day ahead and real time markets and procures power for its retail customers at locational marginal pricing lmp as determined by the miso market 
on june   vectren  together with three other indiana electric utilities  received regulatory authority from the iurc that allows recovery of fuel related costs and deferral of other costs associated with the day energy market 
the order allows fuel related costs to be passed through to customers in vectren s existing fuel cost recovery proceedings 
the other non fuel and miso administrative related costs are to be deferred for recovery as part of the next electric general rate case proceeding  which was filed in during  the iurc reaffirmed the definition of certain costs as fuel related  the company is following those guidelines 
as a result of miso s operational control over much of the midwestern electric transmission grid  including sigeco s transmission facilities  sigeco s continued ability to import power  when necessary  and export power to the wholesale market has been  and may continue to be  impacted 
given the nature of miso s policies regarding use of transmission facilities  as well as ongoing ferc initiatives and uncertainties around day energy market operations  it is difficult to predict near term operational impacts 
however  as stated above  it is believed that miso s regional operation of the transmission system will ultimately lead to reliability improvements 
the potential need to expend capital for improvements to the transmission system  both to sigeco s facilities as well as to those facilities of adjacent utilities  over the next several years will become more predictable as miso completes studies related to regional transmission planning and improvements 
such expenditures may be significant

table of contents impact of recently issued accounting guidance sfas no 
on december   and after calculating the balance sheet impact of the company s retirement plans using the accounting guidance prescribed by sfas and sfas  the company adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
sfas requires the company to recognize the funded status of its pension plans and postretirement plans 
sfas defines the funded status of a defined benefit plan as its assets less its projected benefit obligation  which includes projected salary increases  and defines the funded status of a postretirement plan as its assets less its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
to the extent this obligation exceeded amounts previously recognized  the company recorded a regulatory asset for that portion related to its cost based and rate regulated utilities 
to the extent that excess liability did not relate to a cost based rate regulated utility  the offset was recorded as a reduction to equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 
as a result of adopting this standard  the company s assets increased million  its liabilities increased million and its equity increased million 
sfas also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end balance sheet and requires disclosure in the notes to the financial statements of certain additional information related to net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year 
the measurement date provisions are not required to be adopted until sfas no 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  however  the standard will impact how other fair value based gaap is applied 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption encouraged 
the company is currently assessing the impact this statement will have on its financial statements and results of operations 
fin in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return

the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on operating results or financial condition 
critical accounting policies management is required to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain estimates used in the financial statements are subjective and use variables that require judgment 
these include the estimates to perform goodwill and other asset impairments tests and to determine pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
the company makes other estimates  in the course of accounting for unbilled revenue and the effects of regulation that are critical to the company s financial results but that are less likely to be impacted by near term changes 
other estimates that significantly affect the company s results  but are not necessarily critical to operations  include depreciating utility and non utility plant  valuing reclamation liabilities  valuing derivative contracts  and estimating uncollectible accounts  among others 
actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents impairment review of investments the company has investments in notes receivable  entities accounted for using the cost method of accounting  and entities accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
when events occur that may cause one of these investments to be impaired  the company performs an impairment analysis 
an impairment analysis of notes receivable usually involves the comparison of the investment s estimated free cash flows to the stated terms of the note  or for notes that are collateral dependent  a comparison of the collateral s fair value to the carrying amount of the note 
an impairment analysis of cost method and equity method investments involves comparison of the investment s estimated fair value to its carrying amount 
fair value is estimated using market comparisons  appraisals  and or discounted cash flow analyses 
calculating free cash flows and fair value using the above methods is subjective and requires judgment concerning growth assumptions  longevity of cash flows  and discount rates for fair value calculations 
in and  the company recorded after tax impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
these charges primarily related to synfuel fuel related investments and broadband investments as more fully described below 
on july   the company opted out of its current participation in the production of synthetic fuel due to the high price of oil and the uncertainty of federal legislation that would favorably impact the reference price of oil governing the phase out of synfuel tax credits 
consistent with the company s decision to cease its participation in synfuel production activities  the company completely impaired its million investment in pace carbon 
further  the company is obligated to fund pace carbon on an installment basis for working capital and as tax credits are earned 
the company estimated this remaining funding obligation and other costs to be million and recorded that amount and the impairment charge related to its investment  all totaling million  or million after tax  in earnings in the second quarter of during  the company performed an impairment analysis on its utilicom related investments 
the company used free cash flow analyses to estimate fair value for the cost method portion of the utilicom investment and recoverability of the related notes receivable 
an impairment charge totaling million  million after tax  was recorded as a result of the analysis 
the company sold these investments in  recording an additional loss at disposition of approximately million after tax 
goodwill pursuant to sfas no 
 the company performs an annual impairment analysis of its goodwill  most of which resides in the gas utility services operating segment  at the beginning of each year  and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level 
the company has determined its gas utility services operating segment as identified in note to the consolidated financial statements to be the reporting unit 
nonutility group reporting units are generally defined as the operating companies that aggregate that operating segment 
an impairment test performed in accordance with sfas requires that a reporting unit s fair value be estimated 
the company used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its gas utility services operating segment  and that estimated fair value was compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value was in excess of the carrying amount in   and and therefore resulted in no impairment 
goodwill related to the nonutility group was generally tested during the year using market comparable data or a discounted cash flow model 
estimating fair value using a discounted cash flow model is subjective and requires significant judgment in applying a discount rate  growth assumptions  company expense allocations  and longevity of cash flows 
a basis point increase in the discount rate utilized to calculate the gas utility services segment s fair value also would have resulted in no impairment charge 
pension and other postretirement obligations the company estimates the expected return on plan assets  discount rate  rate of compensation increase  and future health care costs  among other inputs  and relies on actuarial estimates to assess the future potential liability and funding requirements of the company s pension and postretirement plans 
the company annually measures its obligations on september the company used the following weighted average assumptions to develop periodic benefit cost a discount rate of percent  an expected return on plan assets of percent  a rate of compensation increase of percent  and an inflation assumption of percent 
during  the company increased the discount rate by basis points to value ending pension and postretirement obligations and benefit cost due to an increase in benchmark interest rates 
future changes in health care costs  work force demographics  interest rates  or plan changes could significantly affect the estimated cost of these future benefits 
management estimates that a basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased periodic benefit cost by approximately million 

table of contents unbilled revenues to more closely match revenues and expenses  the company records revenues for all gas and electricity delivered to customers but not billed at the end of the accounting period 
the company uses actual units billed during the month to allocate unbilled units by customer class 
those allocated units are multiplied by rates in effect during the month to calculate unbilled revenue at balance sheet dates 
while certain estimates are used in the calculation of unbilled revenue  the method from which these estimates are derived is not subject to near term changes 
regulation at each reporting date  the company reviews current regulatory trends in the markets in which it operates 
this review involves judgment and is critical in assessing the recoverability of regulatory assets as well as the ability to continue to account for its activities based on the criteria set forth in sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
based on the company s current review  it believes its regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
if all or part of the company s operations cease to meet the criteria of sfas  a write off of related regulatory assets and liabilities could be required 
in addition  the company would be required to determine any impairment to the carrying value of its utility plant and other regulated assets 
in the unlikely event of a change in the current regulatory environment  such write offs and impairment charges could be significant

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various business risks associated with commodity prices  interest rates  and counter party credit 
these financial exposures are monitored and managed by the company as an integral part of its overall risk management program 
the company s risk management program includes  among other things  the use of derivatives 
the company also executes derivative contracts in the normal course of operations while buying and selling commodities to be used in operations and optimizing its generation assets 
the company has in place a risk management committee that consists of senior management as well as financial and operational management 
the committee is actively involved in identifying risks as well as reviewing and authorizing risk mitigation strategies 
commodity price risk regulated operations the company s regulated operations have limited exposure to commodity price risk for purchases and sales of natural gas and electricity for retail customers due to current indiana and ohio regulations  which subject to compliance with those regulations  allow for recovery of the cost of such purchases through natural gas and fuel cost adjustment mechanisms 
nevertheless  it is possible regulators may disallow recovery of a portion of gas costs for various reasons  including but not limited to  a finding by the regulator that natural gas was not prudently procured  as an example 
although vectren s regulated operations are exposed to limited commodity price risk  volatile natural gas prices can result in higher working capital requirements  increased expenses including unrecoverable interest costs  uncollectible accounts expense  and unaccounted for gas  and some level of price sensitive reduction in volumes sold or delivered 
the company mitigates these risks by executing derivative contracts that manage the price of forecasted natural gas purchases 
these contracts are subject to regulation which allows for reasonable and prudent hedging costs to be recovered through rates 
constructive regulatory orders  such as the indiana and ohio orders authorizing lost margin recovery  also mitigate these risks 
when regulation is involved  sfas controls when the offset to mark to market accounting is recognized in earnings 
commodity prices for natural gas purchases have remained above historical levels and continue to be more volatile 
despite hedging strategies  this near term change in natural gas commodity prices may have significant effects on operating results as described above 
wholesale power marketing the company s wholesale power marketing activities include asset optimization strategies that manage the utilization of available electric generating capacity 
these optimization strategies involve the sale of excess generation into the miso day ahead and real time markets 
as part of these strategies  the company may also execute energy contracts that commit the company to purchase and sell electricity in the future 
commodity price risk results from forward positions that commit the company to deliver electricity 
the company mitigates price risk exposure with planned unutilized generation capability and offsetting forward purchase contracts 
the company accounts for asset optimization contracts that are derivatives at fair value with the offset marked to market through earnings 
market risk resulting from commodity contracts is measured by management using the potential impact on pre tax earnings caused by the effect a adverse change in forward commodity prices might have on market sensitive derivative positions outstanding on specific dates 
for the year ended december   a adverse change in forward commodity prices would have decreased earnings by million based upon open positions existing on the last day of that year 
no such derivative contracts were outstanding on december  synfuel related activities synfuel tax credits are only available when the price of oil is less than a base price specified by the internal revenue code  as adjusted for inflation 
the company has executed derivative instruments designed to limit the effects of a phase out of synfuel tax credits 
if average oil prices are less than per barrel  these derivatives  which as of december   have a fair value of million  would expire without generating any value to the company  however  no synfuel tax credits would likely be phased out 
at per barrel  these derivatives are expected to be worth approximately million  and for every dollar increase in the price of oil up to  these derivatives are expected to increase in value approximately million 
at per barrel or greater  these derivatives would reach a value in excess of million  however  all synfuel tax credits would likely be phased out 
other operations other commodity related operations are exposed to commodity price risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices including electricity  natural gas  and coal 
other commodity related operations include regulated sales of electricity to certain municipalities and large industrial customers and nonutility retail gas marketing  and coal mining operations 
open positions in terms of price  volume  and specified delivery points may occur and are managed using methods described below with frequent management reporting 
the company purchases and sales commodities  including electricity  natural gas  and coal to meet customer demands and operational needs 
the company executes forward and option contracts that commit the company to purchase and sell commodities in the future 
price risk from forward positions obligating the company to deliver commodities is mitigated using stored inventory  generating capability  and offsetting forward purchase contracts 
price risk also results from forward contracts obligating the company to purchase commodities to fulfill forecasted nonregulated sales of natural gas and coal that may or may not occur 
with the exception of a small portion of contracts that are derivatives that qualify as hedges of forecasted transactions under sfas  these contracts are expected to be settled by physical receipt or delivery of the commodity 
unconsolidated affiliate proliance  a nonregulated energy marketing affiliate  engages in energy hedging activities to manage pricing decisions  minimize the risk of price volatility  and minimize price risk exposure in the energy markets 
proliance s market exposure arises from storage inventory  imbalances  and fixed price forward purchase and sale contracts  which are entered into to support its operating activities 
currently  proliance buys and sells physical commodities and utilizes financial instruments to hedge its market exposure 
however  net open positions in terms of price  volume and specified delivery point do occur 
proliance manages open positions with policies which limit its exposure to market risk and require reporting potential financial exposure to its management and its members 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its borrowing arrangements 
its risk management program seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market volatility may have on interest expense 
the company manages this risk by allowing and of its total debt to be exposed to variable rate volatility 
however  there are times when this targeted range of interest rate exposure may not be attained 
to manage this exposure  the company may use derivative financial instruments 
at december   debt subject to short term interest rate volatility and seasonal increases in short term debt outstanding  represented of the company s total debt portfolio 
market risk is estimated as the potential impact resulting from fluctuations in interest rates on adjustable rate borrowing arrangements exposed to short term interest rate volatility 
during and  the weighted average combined borrowings under these arrangements were million and million  respectively 
at december   and  combined borrowings under these arrangements were million and million  respectively 
based upon average borrowing rates under these facilities during the years ended december  and  an increase of basis points one percentage point in the rates would have increased interest expense by million and million  respectively 
other risks by using forward purchase contracts and derivative financial instruments to manage risk  the company as well as proliance exposes itself to counter party credit risk and market risk 
the company manages exposure to counter party credit risk by entering into contracts with companies that can be reasonably expected to fully perform under the terms of the contract 
counter party credit risk is monitored regularly and positions are adjusted appropriately to manage risk 
further  tools such as netting arrangements and requests for collateral are also used to manage credit risk 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in commodity prices or interest rates 
the company attempts to manage exposure to market risk associated with commodity contracts and interest rates by establishing parameters and monitoring those parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken 
the company s customer receivables from gas and electric sales and gas transportation services are primarily derived from a diversified base of residential  commercial  and industrial customers located in indiana and west central ohio 
the company manages credit risk associated with its receivables by continually reviewing creditworthiness and requests cash deposits or refunds cash deposits based on that review 
credit risk associated with certain investments is also managed by a review of creditworthiness and receipt of collateral
