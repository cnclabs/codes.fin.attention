item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations canadian us dollar exchange rate fluctuation effect on earnings for further information on foreign exchange risks related to our operating costs 
to reduce our exposure to differences in canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations  we periodically enter into and designate canadian dollar forward contracts to hedge certain of our forecasted canadian dollar cash outflows 
we estimate the monthly forecasted canadian dollar outflows on a rolling month basis and  depending on the level of the canadian dollar  hedge the first monthly canadian dollar outflows of manufacturing costs up to of such monthly forecasts in each of the first twelve months and up to in the following twelve months of total forecasted canadian dollar outflows 
at december   we had a notional amount of million of canadian dollar contracts outstanding  however  due to the strong canadian dollar  we are not currently entering into new hedging agreements beyond the next three months 
information regarding the carrying value and fair market value of the contracts is set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our fixed rate long term debt and our short term variable rate bank debt 
our objective is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and on the market value of our borrowings 
we have a mix of fixed rate and variable rate borrowings 
at december  and  we had  million and  million  respectively  of fixed rate long term debt and million and million  respectively  of short and long term variable rate debt 
the fixed rate long term debt is exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates  but not earnings or cash flows 
our variable rate short and long term debt approximates fair value as it bears interest rates that approximate market  but changes in interest rates do affect future earnings and cash flows 
based on our outstanding short and long term variable bank debt  a basis point increase in interest rates would have increased our annual interest expense in and by approximately million and million  respectively 
commodity price risk we purchase significant amounts of energy  chemicals  wood fiber and recovered paper to supply our manufacturing facilities 
these raw materials are market priced commodities and  as such  are subject to fluctuations in market prices 
increases in the prices of these commodities will tend to reduce our reported earnings and decreases will tend to increase our reported earnings 
from time to time  we may enter into contracts aimed at securing a stable source of supply for commodities such as timber  wood fiber  energy  chemicals and recovered paper 
these contracts typically require us to pay the market price at the time of purchase 
thus under these contracts we generally remain subject to market fluctuations in commodity prices
