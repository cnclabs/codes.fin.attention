we currently sell and distribute our products throughout the united states and canada through our network of independent distributors dsd and our national retail accounts dtr  as well as through licensing and distribution arrangements 
we also participate in the carbonated soft drink industry through distribution and sales of our ounce cans of jones pure cane soda through national beverage co 
in grocery and mass merchant channels 
with respect to our distributors dsd we have focused our sales and marketing resources on the expansion and penetration of our products through our independent distributor network in our core markets consisting of the northwest  southwest and midwest us and western canada  as well as targeted expansion into our less penetrated markets consisting of the northeast and southeast us and eastern canada 

table of contents we launched our direct to retail business strategy in as a complementary channel of distribution to our dsd channel  targeting large national retail accounts 
through these programs  we negotiate directly with large national retailers  primarily premier food service based businesses  to carry our products  serviced through the retailer s appointed distribution system 
we currently have distribution arrangements with barnes noble  panera bread company  cost plus world markets  starbucks coffee company and target corporation 
beginning in  we launched our licensing business strategy as a method to extend our brand into non alternative beverage products and non beverage products 
we currently have licensing arrangements with two companies lime lite marketing corporation and big sky brands  inc with these licensing agreements  we believe that we are able to partner with companies that are able to manufacture jones related products and extend our jones brand into select products that we feel enhance our brand image 
critical accounting estimates and policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including  among others  those affecting revenues  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the salability of inventory and the useful lives of tangible and intangible assets 
the discussion below is intended as a brief discussion of some of the judgments and uncertainties that can impact the application of these policies and the specific dollar amounts reported on our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  or if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
many of our estimates or judgments are based on anticipated future events or performance  and as such are forward looking in nature  and are subject to many risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report 
we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this discussion to reflect any future events or circumstances 
we have identified below some of our accounting policies that we consider critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this is not a complete list of all of our accounting policies  and there may be other accounting policies that are significant to us 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and our other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
revenue recognition our products are sold to distributors and various customers and retailers for cash or on credit terms 
our credit terms  which are established in accordance with local and industry practices  typically require payment within days of delivery 
we recognize revenue upon receipt by our distributors and customers of our products  in accordance with written sales terms  net of provisions for discounts and allowances 
all sales to distributors and customers are final sales and we have a no return policy  however  in limited instances  due to credit issues or distributor changes  we may take back product 
licensing revenues are recorded when confirmation of sale to third parties is received by the customer  and represents amounts realized net of provisions for sales returns 
we recognize sale of concentrate relating to a licensing agreement  and as a result  the sale of concentrate and associated costs are recorded on a net basis resulting in no impact to our statements of operations 

table of contents concentrate sales under the agreement with national beverage are recorded on a gross basis 
we also pay lump sum slotting fees and cash payments to certain of our retailers for shelf space in their stores 
these payments have been recorded as a reduction of revenue of approximately  for the twelve month period ended december  compared to a reduction in revenue of approximately  for the twelve month period ended december  we amortize lump sum slotting fee payments over a year period  which is based on current data of product maintenance on retail shelves for that period of time 
allowance for doubtful accounts  bad debt expense management must estimate the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we believe that in general bad debts for other companies in the beverage industry represent approximately of total sales 
historically  our bad debt expense has represented approximately of total sales 
bad debt expense is classified within general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
to date  other than as a result of specific customer bankruptcies in  we have not incurred material write offs of accounts receivable 
in considering the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we rely heavily on our history of write offs and that our revenue is not dependent on one or a few customers  but is spread among a number of customers 
other factors which could cause management to change its estimates would be a downturn in the economy that management determines has the potential to affect collections if we experience a greater concentration of our receivables coming from fewer customers 
in such events  we may be required to record additional charges to cover this exposure 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our bad debt expenses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
inventory we hold raw materials and finished goods inventories  which are manufactured and procured based on our sales forecasts 
we value inventory at the lower of cost and estimated net realizable value and include adjustments for estimated obsolescence  principally on a first in first out basis 
these valuations are subject to customer acceptance and demand for the particular products  and our estimates of future realizable values are based on these forecasted demands 
we regularly review inventory detail to determine whether a write down is necessary 
we consider various factors in making this determination  including recent sales history and predicted trends  industry market conditions and general economic conditions 
differences could result in the amount and timing of write downs for any period if we make different judgments or use different estimates 
we also determine an allowance for obsolescence based on finished goods that are older than twelve months from production date 
deferred income taxes the determination of our provision of income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
significant judgment is required in assessing  among other things  the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items 
prior to the second quarter of  we maintained a valuation allowance for all of the us and foreign deferred taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes due to the uncertainty regarding the full utilization of our deferred tax asset 
with our improved profitability over the past three years  during which time we generated taxable income to utilize some of these loss carry forwards  management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized and has  as such  reversed the valuation allowance against us federal deferred tax assets in as at december   we have operating losses of approximately

and in anticipation of dsd sales for the first quarter of contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements our commitments as of december  with respect to known contractual obligations were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations long term debt purchase delegations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet capital expenditure commitments total we have approximately  of commitments for capital expenditures in relating to the purchase of co packing equipment related to the conversion to pure cane sugar in our co packing facilities 
seasonality we have experienced significant fluctuations in quarterly results that have been the result of many factors 
in particular  like many other companies in the beverage industry  we generate a substantial percentage of our revenues during the warm weather months of april through september 
management believes that the demand for our products will continue to reflect such seasonal consumption patterns 
in addition  our operating results are dependent upon the performance of our independent distributors  as well as competition in the industry and general economic conditions 
due to these and other factors  our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period 
as a result  management believes that period to period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance 
while we look to expand our distribution network and increase market penetration  however  such seasonality may not be easily discernible from results of operations 
due to all of the foregoing factors  our operating results in a particular quarter may fail to meet market expectations 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  stock based compensation expense is recognized using the fair value based method for all awards granted on or after the date of adoption 
compensation expense for unvested stock options and awards that were outstanding on january  will be recognized over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of those options and awards as previously calculated under the pro forma disclosures under sfas  as adjusted to reflect the estimated forfeitures 
we have adopted the black scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value of each option grant 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in our pro forma information required under sfas for the periods prior to january   we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of our business  our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks 
the principal market risks to which we are exposed are competition within the beverage industry and fluctuations in energy and commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and also the limited availability of certain raw materials and co packer capacity 
we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because of our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
the majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  a majority portion of our co packing operations are in canada  and we are subject to fluctuations in the canadian dollar 
we are also subject to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate  including the collectibility of accounts receivable 
there are no other off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases disclosed in contractual obligations 
at december   the majority of our debt consisted of variable rate debt under our capital leases and we have no long term debt 
during the year ended december   we did not make any draws on our line of credit
