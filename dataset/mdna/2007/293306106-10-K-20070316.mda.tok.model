item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion is qualified in its entirety by  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
note to the financial statements contain segment information 
overview we furnish engineering consulting and control system services to the petroleum refining  petrochemical  pipeline  production and processing industries 
our business consists of two segments engineering and systems 
our engineering segment offers engineering consulting services to clients for the development  management and turnkey execution of engineering projects  construction management  inspection services  land management and environmental compliance services 
our systems segment designs  assembles  integrates and services control and instrumentation systems for specific applications in the energy and process related industries 
the company s revenue is composed of engineering  construction and procurement service revenue and product sales 
the company recognizes service revenue as soon as the services are performed 
the majority of the company s engineering services have historically been provided through cost plus contracts whereas a majority of the company s product sales are earned on fixed price contracts 
in the course of providing our services  we routinely provide engineering  materials  and equipment and may provide construction services on a subcontractor basis 
generally  these materials  equipment and subcontractor costs are passed through to our clients and reimbursed  along with fees  which in total are at margins lower than those of our normal core business 
in accordance with industry practice and generally accepted accounting principles  all costs and fees are included in revenue 
the use of subcontractor services can change significantly from project to project  therefore  changes in revenue may not be indicative of business trends 
for analytical purposes only  we have historically segregated from our total revenue the revenues derived from material assets or companies acquired during the first months following their respective dates of acquisition and referred to such revenue as acquisition revenue 
we also segregate gross profits and sg a expenses derived from material assets or company acquisitions on the same basis as we segregate revenues 
we analyze  for internal purposes only  the percentage of our revenue that comes from staffing services versus the percentage that comes from engineering services  as engineering services have a higher margin than staffing services 
operating sg a expense includes management and staff compensation  office costs such as rents and utilities  depreciation  amortization  travel and other expenses generally unrelated to specific client contracts  but directly related to the support of a segment s operation 
corporate sg a expense is comprised primarily of marketing costs  as well as costs related to the executive  governance investor relations  finance  accounting  safety  human resources  project controls and information technology departments and other costs generally unrelated to specific client projects  but which can vary as costs are incurred to support corporate activities and initiatives 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data derived from our consolidated statements of operations and indicates the percentage of total revenue for each item

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued year ended december  compared to year ended december  note previously  within the systems segment  esi provided products and services supporting the advanced automation and integrated controls fields

revenues and expenses have been reclassified between the segments to provide comparative results 
amounts will tie in total to prior reporting  however  individual segments will vary from prior reports 
total revenue engineering revenue accounted for of our total revenue for the year  increasing million from million in to million in the increase in engineering revenue was primarily brought about by increased activity in the engineering and construction markets 
refining related activity has been particularly strong  including projects to satisfy environmental mandates  expand existing facilities and utilize heavier sour crude 
capital spending in the pipeline area is also trending higher  with numerous projects in north america currently underway to deliver crude oil  natural gas  petrochemicals and refined products 
renewable energy appears to be an emerging area of activity and potential growth  with the company currently performing a variety of services for ethanol  biodiesel  coal to liquids  petroleum coke to ammonia  and other biomass processes 
the acquisitions of wrc in the second quarter of  together with our clients increased demand for in plant and inspection resources  stimulated growth in our staffing services division where revenues increased  or million  from million in to million in revenue from procurement services decreased  or million  from million in to million in this significant decrease is primarily related to three projects  two of which began in and one of which began in and were materially completed in the level of procurement services is expected to vary over time depending on the volume of procurement activity our customers choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services on larger epc contracts 
in  the company was awarded two significant fixed price engineering  procurement and construction epc projects in the refining industry that included procurement and subcontractor activities within our scope of work 
this accounts for the higher level in that year 
together these two fixed price epc projects accounted for approximately million of the engineering segment revenues during compared to approximately million during the current combined contract value of these two projects is approximately million and both are currently scheduled for completion by the end of the second quarter of as a result of revised estimates of the percentage of completion of these projects  the company suffered a reversal of million in the third quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of due to losses incurred in the execution of these contracts  we anticipate that we will enter into this type of contract only on a very limited basis  if at all 
the systems segment contributed of our total revenue for the year  as its revenue increased million  or  from million in to million in revenue in a general turnaround in the oil and gas industry  together with the acquisition of ati in january has increased the demand for esi s services 
another factor positively affecting esi s business is that the computer based distributed control systems equipment used for facility plant automation becomes technologically obsolete over time  which supports ongoing replacement of these systems 
backlog for esi at december  reached million  compared to million at december  gross profit primarily due to losses on two epc fixed price contracts in our engineering segment  as discussed above  total gross profit decreased million  or  from million in to million in and  as a percentage of total revenue  decreased from to during the same period 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued due to the material financial impact of the losses on two significant fixed price epc projects during  the following non gaap proforma financial is being presented to demonstrate the performance of the historical core business within the engineering segment

as a percentage of revenue  total gross profit  again  excluding the recorded losses on two significant fixed price epc projects  would have increased  increasing from in to in due to the significant losses on these two projects the company plans to limit the size and scope of fixed price epc contracts in the future 
both of the significant fixed price epc projects are scheduled for completion by the end of the second quarter of also during the past year  the company has shifted a portion of its services to developer type work for customers that are typically smaller than its historical customer base 
the viability of these projects and the creditworthiness of these types of customers must be carefully analyzed to assure profitable results 
in the future  the company intends to analyze these projects much more carefully before accepting them 
the company has also engaged in a number of entrepreneurial ventures over the past several years  not all of which have been profitable 
in the future  the company intends to scrutinize these projects much more carefully before engaging in them and exit them more quickly if they are not successful 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued gross profit from engineering  including the breakout of acquisitions  decreased million  or  from million in to million in and  as a percentage of revenue  decreased from in to in primarily due to estimated losses of approximately million on two epc fixed price contracts 
both projects are currently scheduled for completion by the end of the second quarter of the staffing services division  consisting of our in plant staffing  land management and inspection operations  increased gross profit million  or  from million in to million in we earn a lower margin on procurement services as compared to the margin we earn on our core engineering services 
as an example  procurement services for produced a gross profit margin 
comparably  in gross profit margin on core engineering services was 
our level of procurement revenue has recently trended down  from million or of total revenue for to million or of total revenue for any shift from engineering only to epc projects that include material procurement and construction responsibility will negatively impact engineering gross profit as a percentage of revenue 
in this case  lower gross profit will occur because higher historical cost plus margins on engineering labor recognized during the period in which it was earned will now be combined with the lower margins on procurement services and construction subcontractor charges and recorded throughout the overall duration and completion of the projects 
at december   we had outstanding unapproved change orders claims of approximately million  net of reserves of million associated with ongoing fixed price epc projects 
if in the future we determine collection of the unapproved change orders claims is not probable  it will result in a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 
gross profit for our systems segment increased million  or  from million in to million in however  as a percent of revenue  gross profit increased by from in to in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in  primarily due to increases in salaries and burdens  facilities and office expenses  amortization expense and travel 
as a percent of revenue  sg a increased from in to in salaries and burden expenses increased million in over of which million of this increase was related to stock compensation expense recorded during the year 
the company did not record stock compensation expense during  as the company adopted sfas no 
r on january  see note 
an additional million of the increase was due to increases in corporate salaries  as employees were added  primarily in business development  accounting and it  to support company growth 
the remainder of the increase came from increases in operation salaries and burdens primarily due to increases in administrative staffing from acquisitions and eag s continued growth during the year 
facilities and office expenses increased million in over due to the expansion of eei s offices in tulsa  houston  and beaumont to meet both current and projected growth requirements  plus the additional cost of facilities utilized by acquisitions made throughout the year 
amortization expense increased approximately  primarily as a result of our completing the valuation of intangible assets acquired in acquisitions completed during see note 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued increased business development activity pushed marketing and travel expenses up by over  in over similar expenses in operating profit operating profit decreased million to million in as compared to million in  decreasing  as a percentage of total revenue  from in to in this decrease was primarily the result of the company s performance on two fixed price contracts

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued year ended december  compared to year ended december  note previously  within the systems segment  esi provided products and services supporting the advanced automation and integrated controls fields 
in january  eag assumed responsibility for these services  which resulted in a move of this division of esi to the engineering segment 
revenues and expenses have been reclassified between the segments to provide comparative results 
amounts will tie in total to prior reporting  however  individual segments will vary from prior reports 
total revenue engineering revenue accounted for of our total revenue for  an increase of million from million in to million in the increase in engineering revenue was primarily brought about by increased activity in the engineering and construction markets 
refining related activity has been particularly strong  including projects to satisfy environmental mandates  expand existing facilities and utilize heavier sour crude 
acquisitions in the fourth quarter of  together with our client s increased demand for in house technical and inspection resources  stimulated growth in our staffing services division where revenues increased  or million  from million in to million in revenue from procurement services increased  or million  from to and contributed  or million  of the increase in total engineering revenue during the same period 
the level of procurement services varies depending on the volume of procurement activity our customers choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services on the larger epc contracts 
in  the company was awarded two significant fixed price engineering  procurement and construction epc projects in the refining industry that includes procurement and subcontractor activities within our scope of work 
the systems segment contributed of our total revenue for the year  as its revenue increased million  or  from million in to million in revenue in projects from one major supplier of distributed control systems dcs equipment  together with projects from a large engineering and construction firm  contributed most of the increase in revenue in the completion of turnkey remote instrument enclosures rie s from projects awarded in the fourth quarter of contributed million to esi s revenue in acquisition revenue  represented only of total revenue for  increased  or million  during the comparable periods  primarily from nine months of revenue generated in through acquisitions completed in the th quarter of gross profit total gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in although  as a percentage of total revenue  decreased slightly from to during the same period 
gross profit from engineering increased million  or  from million in to million in and  as a percentage of revenue  increased from in to in gross profit was negatively impacted by approximately  during due to start up expenses and non reimbursable proposal activity conducted by two of the company s internal start up initiatives  englobal sulfur group and englobal automation group 
the staffing services division increased gross profit million  or  from million in to million in on margins remaining relatively stable over the comparable periods  although such margins are approximately lower than average margins on all other engineering revenues 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued we earn a lower margin on procurement services as compared to the margin we earn on our core engineering services 
in  million  or of the increase in our total revenue was from procurement services  providing a gross profit margin 
comparably  gross profit margin on core engineering services was 
in  procurement services produced a 
gross profit margin 
due to the increase in procurement services in over  our overall gross profit  as a percentage of total revenue  was negatively impacted by and  respectively 
again  the shift to more fixed price epc type projects will negatively impact engineering gross profit as a percentage of revenue because higher historical cost plus margins on engineering labor recognized during the period in which it was earned will now be combined with the lower margins on procurement services and construction subcontractor charges and recorded throughout the overall duration and completion of the projects 
gross profit for our systems segment decreased million  or  from million in to million in also  as a percent of revenue  gross profit decreased by from in to in the lower margin in is a result of several factors 
the increase in the workload created a shortage in shop labor which was filled by hiring contract labor leading to inefficiencies and rework 
this led to overruns in shop labor on projects  thus dropping margins below already tight budgeted margins 
secondly  with the increase in proposal work  estimates of material and labor cost were underestimated  thus causing lower profit margins 
lastly  market pressures drove down margins on projects overall 
corrective measures were taken during the first quarter of to replace all contract labor with more stable  direct hire employees and additional staffing and systems within the estimating and proposal group should improve proposal pricing 
during the fourth quarter of  esi experienced delays in receiving major components for a project that were being supplied by a third party vendor 
as a result  the work esi expected to perform on such project during was completed in  resulting in a corresponding delay in our recognition of revenues and profits 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in  primarily due to increases in salaries and burdens  facilities and office expenses  and travel 
however  as a percent of revenue  sg a decreased from in to in salaries and burden expenses increased million in over million of this increase was related to additional incentives paid under the incentive plans 
an additional million of the increase was due to increases in corporate salaries  primarily in business development  accounting and project controls  to support company growth 
the remainder of the increase came from increases in operation salaries and burdens primarily due to increases in administrative staffing from acquisitions  eag s start up during the year  esi s expansion into the beaumont area  and increases in their administrative support staffing in the houston facility  plus additional overhead due to the growth of eei s offices in beaumont and tulsa 
facilities and office expenses increased million in over due to the expansion of eei s offices in tulsa  houston  dallas  and beaumont to meet both current and projected growth requirements  plus the additional cost of facilities utilized by acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of increased business development activity pushed marketing and travel expenses up by almost  in over similar expenses in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued operating profit operating profit increased million to million in as compared to million in  increasing  as a percentage of total revenue  from in to in although operating profit for exceeded operating profit for  our net operating profit for the fourth quarter of was down approximately million  or  over third quarter operating results  primarily due to losses of approximately  in start up expenses and non reimbursable proposal activity conducted by two of the company s internal start up initiatives  englobal sulfur group and eag 
for  the combined operating loss for both groups was approximately  other income expense other income decreased from  in to  in the income in resulted from a legal settlement 
the income in was derived from distributions from pei investments  insurance proceeds from hurricane rita losses  and income from the sale of assets  partially offset by a reclassification of financing costs 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have satisfied our cash requirements through operations and borrowings under a revolving credit facility 
the company s current credit facility is with comerica bank comerica and consists of a line of credit maturing july  the loan agreement positions comerica as senior to all other debt 
the line of credit is limited to million subject to loan covenant restrictions 
the comerica credit facility is collateralized by substantially all the assets of the company 
as of december   the outstanding balance on the line of credit was million and we had working capital of million 
our total long term debt outstanding on december  was million see note  an increase from million as of december  under the terms and conditions of our revolving credit facility  as of december   we have additional borrowing capacity of approximately million after consideration of borrowing base limitations with no letters of credit outstanding at december  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  caption payments due by period and total thereafter in thousands 
del long term debt     operating leases       total contractual cash obligations    del 
long term debt includes future interest payments assuming the existing long term debt and revolving credit facility remain outstanding with the interest rate in effect at december  the company s interest rate on its revolving credit facility fluctuates with the prime rate 
cash flow we believe that we have sufficient available cash required for operations for the next months 
however  cash and the availability of cash could be materially restricted if circumstances prevent the timely internal processing of invoices  if amounts billed are not collected or are not collected in a timely manner  if project mix shifts from cost reimbursable to fixed costs contracts during significant periods of growth  if the company was to lose one or more of its major customers  if the company experiences further costs overruns on fixed price contract  or if we not able to meet the covenants of the comerica credit facility 
if any such event occurs  we would be forced to consider alternative financing options 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued operating activities operating activities required the use of million  million  and million in net cash in  and  respectively 
though a decline in revenues would be likely to adversely impact our cash flow from operations  we believe that future cash flows  our ability to manage the timing of acquisitions  and our borrowing capacity under our line of credit will allow us to meet cash requirements in and beyond 
future uses of cash in operations will continue to be primarily for labor and material costs required in connection with contract performance 
the primary factors impacting the increase in our need for cash and the year over year increase in average accounts receivable days outstanding were a past due accounts receivable balance of approximately million as of december  related to delays in receipts for services on the start up of a major alliance agreement that began during the second quarter of this year  a decrease in billings in excess of costs from approximately million to  as of december  and respectively  and an increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings from approximately million to million as of december  and  respectively 
although the above factors are all within rights and restrictions of contractual terms and conditions within client contracts  we are taking measures to remediate each of these factors and at this time do not expect their impact to continue beyond the first quarter of investing activities investing activities used cash totaling million in  compared to million in and million in in  our investing activities consisted of capital additions of million primarily for computers and leasehold improvements to our offices and software implementations 
in the fourth quarter   was used to complete the acquisition of watco management  inc future investing activities are anticipated to remain consistent with prior years and include capital additions for leasehold improvements  technical applications software  and equipment  such as upgrades to computers 
on december   we amended our line of credit to permit an increase in annual capital expenditure limits from million to million 
financing activities financing activities provided cash totaling million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
our primary financing mechanism is our revolving line of credit 
the line of credit has been used principally to finance acquisitions and accounts receivable 
during  our borrowings  on the line of credit were million  and we repaid an aggregate of million on our short term and long term bank and other debt 
future cash flows from financing activities are anticipated to be borrowings  payments on the line of credit and payments on long term debt instruments 
line of credit fluctuations are a function of timing related to operations  obligations and payments received on accounts receivable 
payments on long term debt  including interest for the coming year  are estimated to be million 
in  non cash transactions included  notes receivable issued for sale of assets and million notes payable issued for acquisitions 
also in  million of stock was issued associated with the acquisition of wrc 
there were no significant non cash transactions in in  non cash transactions include million notes payable issued related to acquisitions and  note payable issued for treasury stock 
we also acquired insurance with notes payable of million   and million in   and  respectively 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued due to significant losses incurred on two fixed price projects during the third and fourth quarter  the company requested and was successful in obtaining a waiver and subsequent amendment to its credit agreement with comerica bank in order to meet the monthly fixed charge ratio 
if we had not been able to obtain a waiver or amendment of the covenant  we may have been unable to make further borrowings and may have been required to repay all loans then outstanding under the credit facility 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or otherwise 
furthermore  we have not engaged in energy or commodity trading activities and do not anticipate doing so in the future  nor do we have any transactions involving unconsolidated entities or special purpose entities 
asset management we typically sell our products and services on short term credit and seek to minimize our credit risk by performing credit checks and conducting our own collection efforts 
our trade accounts receivable increased to million from million as of december  and  respectively 
the number of days outstanding for trade accounts receivable increased from days at december   to days at december  our actual bad debt expense has been approximately 
and 
of revenues for the years ending december  and we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from  to  or of trade accounts receivable balance for each of the years and  respectively 
risk management in performing services for our clients  we could potentially be liable for breach of contract  personal injury  property damage or negligence  including professional errors and omissions 
we often agree to indemnify our clients for losses and expenses incurred as a result of our negligence and  in certain cases  the sole or concurrent negligence of our clients 
our quality control and assurance program includes a control function to establish standards and procedures for performance and for documentation of project tasks  and an assurance function to audit and to monitor compliance with procedures and quality standards 
we maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and third party property damage  professional errors and omissions  and workers compensation coverage  which we consider sufficient to insure against these risks  subject to self insured amounts 
seasonality holidays and employee vacations during our fourth quarter exert downward pressure on revenues for that quarter  which is only partially offset by the year end efforts on the part of many clients to spend any remaining funds budgeted for engineering services or capital expenditures during the year 
the annual budgeting and approval process under which these clients operate is normally not completed until after the beginning of each new year  which can depress results for the first quarter 
principally due to these factors  our revenues during the first and fourth quarters generally tend to be lower than in the second and third quarters 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition because the majority of the company s revenues are recognized under cost plus contracts  significant estimates are generally not involved in determining revenue recognition 
however  in  the company suffered reversals due to its failure to accurately estimate revenue recognition on our two significant fixed price epc contracts 
most of our contracts are with fortune companies 
as a result  collection risk is generally not a relevant factor in the recognition of revenue 
however  timing of accounts receivable collections has resulted in a serious impact in the company s liquidity 
also  the company is engaging in more development contracts with smaller companies 
we anticipate that collection risk will be a larger risk on these projects 
our revenues are largely composed of engineering service revenue and product sales 
the majority of our services are provided through time and material contracts also referred to as cost plus contracts  of which have not to exceed provisions that place a cap on the revenue that we may receive under a particular contract 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued these time and material billings are produced every two weeks 
most of the contracts with not to exceed provisions are minor in nature 
on occasion  we serve as purchasing agent by procuring subcontractors  material and equipment on behalf of a client and passing the cost on to the client with no mark up or profit 
in accordance with statement of position sop  revenues and costs for these type purchases are not included in total revenues and costs 
for financial reporting this pass through type of transaction is reported net 
profits and losses on fixed fee contracts are recorded on the percentage of completion method of accounting  measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date to estimated total contract costs for each contract 
contract costs include amounts paid to subcontractors 
anticipated losses on uncompleted construction contracts are charged to operations as soon as such losses can be estimated 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
the asset  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed on fixed fee contracts 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated profits on uncompleted contracts represents amounts billed in excess of revenues recognized on fixed fee contracts 
goodwill a change in assumptions in the estimation of the fair market value of the segments would unlikely give rise to an impairment of goodwill without deteriorating operating results in the segments 
in conjunction with each acquisition  we must allocate the cost of the acquired entity to the assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
as additional information becomes available  adjustments may be made to the original estimates within a short time subsequent to the acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized but instead is periodically assessed for impairment 
the impairment testing entails estimating current market value of the segments  based on management s estimate of market conditions including pricing  demand  competition  operating costs and other factors 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired involves professional judgment and is ultimately based on management s assessment of the value of the assets acquired 
we believe our estimates for these items are reasonable  but there is no assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
change orders change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change deliverables under a contract without adding new provisions 
either we or our clients may initiate change orders 
change orders may include changes in specifications or design  manner of performance  equipment  materials  scope of work  and or the period of completion of the project 
change orders occur when changes are experienced once a contract is begun 
change orders are sometimes documented and the terms of change orders are agreed with the client before the work is performed 
other times  circumstances may require that work progress without the client s written agreement before the work is performed 
in those cases  we are taking a risk that the customer will not sign a change order or at a later time the customer will seek to negotiate the pricing of the additional work 
costs related to change orders are recognized when they are incurred 
change orders are included in the total estimated contract revenue when it is probable that the change orders will result in a bona fide addition to value that can be reliably estimated 
we have a favorable history of negotiating and collecting for work performed under change orders and our bi weekly billing cycle has proven to be timely enough to properly account for change orders 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the provisions of sfas no 
should be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which sfas no 
is initially applied  except in limited circumstances 
the company expects to adopt sfas no 
beginning january  the company is currently evaluating the impact that this interpretation may have on its consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab no 
 which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
the provisions of sab no 
are effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of the company does not expect any impact to its consolidated financial statements upon adoption of sab no 
in june  fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement accounting for income taxes  was issued 
fin no 
describes accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  and includes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for recognizing the effect of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted fin no 
on january   and the company expects that it will not have a material effect on its financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation was revised sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions and requires that companies record compensation expense for employee stock option awards 
sfas no 
r is effective for annual periods beginning after june  the company adopted sfas no  r on january  using the modified prospective method 
see note in march  fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 was issued 
fin no 
clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin no 
was effective for the year ended december   but did not have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
this statement also resolves issues addressed in statement no 
implementation issue no 
d  application of statement to beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
sfas no 
permits fair value re measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation and clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas no 
sfas no 
is amended to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued during fiscal years beginning after september  the company does not expect this statement to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no there are no investments at december  accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
as of december  and  the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
the company s primary interest rate risk relates to its variable rate line of credit debt obligation  which totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
assuming a increase in the interest rate on this variable rate debt obligation ie  an increase from the actual average interest rate of as of december   to an average interest rate of  annual interest expense would have been approximately  higher in based on the annual average balance 
the company does not have any interest rate swap or exchange agreements 
the company has no market risk exposure in the areas of interest rate risk from investments because the company did not have an investment portfolio as of december  currently  the company does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
transactions in canadian dollars in our canadian subsidiary have been translated into us dollars using the current rate method  such that assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and revenue and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange during the appropriate fiscal period
