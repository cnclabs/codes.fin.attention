item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial section roadmap the financial section of our annual report includes management s discussion and analysis  our consolidated financial statements  notes to those financial statements and a five year summary of financial information 
we have prepared the following summary  or roadmap  to assist in your review of the financial section 
it is designed to give you an overview of our company and focus your review by directing you to some of the more important activities and events that occurred this year 
our business we principally research  design  develop  manufacture  integrate  operate and sustain advanced technology systems and products  and provide a broad range of management  engineering  technical  scientific  logistic and information services 
we mainly serve customers in domestic and international defense  civil agencies  and homeland security 
our sales to agencies of the us government  including those to the department of defense dod  represented of our sales in of the remaining of sales  approximately related to sales to international customers including foreign military sales funded  in whole or in part  by the us government  with the remainder attributable to commercial and other customers 
in and  sales to agencies of the us government represented and of our total sales  respectively 
our main areas of focus are in defense  space  intelligence  homeland security  and government information technology 
we operate in five principal business segments aeronautics  electronic systems  space systems  information technology global services it gs  and integrated systems solutions is s 
the name of our it gs segment  formerly known as information technology services  was changed to better reflect the segment s capabilities and service offerings following the growth experienced by our information technology and business process services businesses and through recent acquisitions 
as a lead systems integrator  our products and services range from electronics and information systems  including integrated net centric solutions  to missiles  aircraft and spacecraft 
on february   we announced a realignment of our operations to enhance support for critical customer missions and increase our integration of resources 
the realignment includes the combination of our it gs and is s business segments into a new business segment named information systems global services is gs 
in addition  several smaller components of our businesses were realigned as discussed more fully under the caption business segments in item business 
these changes do not affect the historical results  discussion or presentation of our business segments as set forth in this form k 
we will begin to report our financial results consistent with this new structure beginning with the first quarter of financial section overview the financial section includes the following management s discussion and analysis  or md a pages through provides our management s view about industry trends  risks and uncertainties relating to lockheed martin  accounting policies that we view as critical in light of our business  our results of operations  including discussions about the key performance drivers of each of our business segments  our financial position and cash flows  commitments and contingencies  important events or transactions that have occurred over the last three years  and forward looking information  as appropriate

the notes to the financial statements also are prepared in accordance with gaap 
highlights the financial section of our annual report describes our ongoing operations  including discussions about particular lines of business or programs  our ability to finance our operating activities  and trends and uncertainties in our industry and how they might affect our future operations 
we also discuss those items affecting our results that were not considered in senior management s assessment of the operating performance of our business segments 
we separately disclose these items to assist in your evaluation of our overall operating performance and financial condition of our consolidated company 
we would like to draw your attention to the following items disclosed in this financial section and where you will find them topic location s critical accounting policies contract accounting revenue recognition page and page postretirement benefit plans page and page environmental matters page  page and page discussion of business segments page and page liquidity and cash flows page and page capital structure and resources page  page  page and page legal proceedings  commitments and contingencies page and page stock based compensation page  page and page industry considerations department of defense business the president s budget proposal for fiscal years focuses on achieving a balanced budget while addressing the nation s most critical needs and prosecuting the global war on terrorism 
the administration s priorities include a strong national defense  tax relief to support economic growth  enhanced energy security  affordable health care  and further education improvement 
approximately of the budget is devoted to defense and other matters of national security 
customer requirements for defense and related advanced technology systems for and beyond will continue to be affected by the global war on terrorism through the continued need for military missions and reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan and the related fiscal consequences of war 
for fiscal year  the president s budget includes billion for the department of defense the dod  reflecting the administration s commitment to continued modernization of our armed forces while prosecuting the war on terrorism 
this amount  called the base budget  excludes any funding for ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan and the global war on terrorism 
these costs  discussed below  are requested as emergency supplemental funding 
the fiscal year dod base budget is an increase of billion  or over the fiscal year base budget 
the dod base budget includes billion for procurement of systems procurement and billion for research  development  test  and evaluation rdt e  known as the investment accounts 
the current year s budget represents a nearly increase in the investment accounts over fiscal year levels 
the operations and maintenance accounts  which contain the bulk of funding for training  logistics  services  and other sustainment activities  total approximately billion for fiscal year  an increase of billion  or nearly  over fiscal year levels 
the balance of the budget  including amounts for military personnel and military construction  is funded at billion  compared to the fiscal year level of billion 
over the fiscal years future years defense plan fydp  total dod funding is expected to rise to billion in  or higher than the fiscal year budget 
total funding for the dod over the first four years covered by the fiscal year fydp proposal is  billion  an increase of billion from the corresponding four fiscal years in the fiscal year plan released one year ago 
in addition to the base dod budget  the budget proposal includes billion in supplemental funding for those activities not funded in the base budget for fiscal years   and  bringing the grand total for dod requested in the president s february  budget proposal to billion 
as part of the supplemental amounts  the administration is again requesting funding to defray costs for operation iraqi freedom and operation enduring freedom in afghanistan 
for fiscal year  the administration is requesting billion for dod  in addition to the billion already approved by congress in the fiscal year dod appropriations act 
for fiscal year  the administration has included a request for billion in supplemental  or bridge  funding for anticipated  but not yet fully defined  war related costs that are 
table of contents expected to be needed early in fiscal year in addition  the administration has included an estimate of billion in the fiscal year dod budget projection for continuing costs of the iraq and afghanistan deployments 
spending for procurement of equipment and systems comprises about  or billion  of these requested supplemental funds for fiscal year and  reflecting the administration s broadened definition of emergency funding related to the global war on terrorism 
supplemental funding enables the dod to proceed on critical modernization and acquisition programs  versus using amounts available for those programs to pay for the iraq and afghanistan missions 
while congress has expressed concern about the size of supplemental budgets  it is unlikely that funding for ongoing operations will be significantly curtailed by congress and  thus  we do not believe that operations in iraq and afghanistan will materially impact the investment accounts in the near term 
we believe our broad mix of programs and capabilities continues to position us favorably to support the current and future needs of the dod 
our strong positions in air power projection  precision strike capability  and air mobility aircraft are strongly supported in the dod budget request 
two of our more significant programs are the f raptor air dominance fighter and the f lightning ii joint strike fighter 
the president s fiscal year budget request includes billion for the f program to continue production of the aircraft under a multiyear contract expected to be entered into this year  and billion for the f program  including procurement of aircraft 
in addition  funding of million is proposed to support the last year of production under the c j multiyear contract  with additional aircraft included in the supplemental funding requests 
the air force budget also supports our contract to upgrade the c strategic airlift aircraft 
we are also represented in almost every aspect of land  sea  air and space based missile defense  including the aegis weapon system program  the medium extended air defense system meads  the patriot advanced capability pac missile program  the terminal high altitude area defense thaad system  and the multiple kill vehicle mkv program 
in the areas of space intelligence and information superiority  we have leadership positions on programs such as the tsat mission operations system tmos  mobile user objective system muos  the advanced extremely high frequency aehf system  and the space based infrared system high sbirs h  and in classified programs 
we are broadly positioned across the dod in the area of command  control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance cisr  including the air operations center weapons system integrator aoc wsi  the warfighter information network tactical win t  the combatant commanders integrated command and control system ccics  and the global communications support system air force gcss af 
we have expanded into adjacent military product lines utilizing our existing advanced technology products and services 
both the littoral combat ship and the vh us presidential helicopter programs are supported in the budget request 
we are a significant presence in information technology support and modernization for the dod 
we are continuing to pursue opportunities to expand our sustainment and logistical support activities to enhance the longevity of the systems procured by our customers and improve supply chain management  and we see opportunities to grow our business in outsourcing of service functions and business process management 
recent acquisitions  such as savi technology  inc  pacific architects and engineers  inc 
pae and aspen systems corporation  support our access to new business within the dod and other agencies of the us government 
most of the aforementioned programs require funding over several annual government budget cycles 
there is always an inherent risk that these and other dod programs which are subject to annual appropriation by congress could become potential targets for future reductions or elimination of funding to pay for other programs 
non department of defense business the war on terrorism has focused greater attention on the security of our homeland and the need for better communication and interoperability among law enforcement  civil government agencies  intelligence agencies  and our military services 
our experience in the defense arena  together with our core information technology expertise  has enabled us to provide products and services to a number of government agencies  including the departments of homeland security  justice  commerce  health and human services  transportation and energy  the us postal service  the social security administration  the federal aviation administration  the national aeronautics and space administration nasa  the environmental protection agency epa  and the library of congress 
certain of our acquisition activities  such as the acquisition of pae in  have also given us access to new customers outside of the dod  such as the department of state 
we have continued to expand our capabilities in critical intelligence  knowledge management and e government solutions for our customers  including the social security administration and the epa  as well for the dod 
we also provide program management  business strategy and consulting  complex systems development and maintenance  complete life cycle 
table of contents software support  information assurance and enterprise solutions 
the expected growth in business process outsourcing has been enabled by rule changes for public private competitions  enabling the selection in of lockheed martin to operate the federal aviation administration s automated flight services station network 
in addition  recent trends continue to indicate an increase in demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems and solutions 
as a result  we continue to focus our resources in support of infrastructure modernization that allows for interoperability and communication across agencies 
in addition  the continuing strong emphasis on homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as air traffic management  ports  waterways and cargo security  biohazard detection systems for postal equipment  employee identification and credential verification systems  information systems security and other global security systems solutions 
although our lines of business addressing civil government needs are not dependent on defense budgets  they share many of the same risks as our defense businesses  particularly the requirement for approval in annual appropriations acts 
other risks are unique to particular programs 
for example  although indemnification by the us government to cover potential claims or liabilities resulting from a failure of technologies developed and deployed may be available in some instances for our defense businesses  us government indemnification may not be available for homeland security purposes 
in addition  there are some instances where the us government could provide indemnification under applicable law  but elects not to do so 
while we maintain insurance for some business risks  it is not possible to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities 
we generally seek  and in certain cases have obtained  limitation of such potential liabilities related to the sale and use of our homeland security products and services through qualification by the department of homeland security under the safety act provisions of the homeland security act of where we are unable to secure indemnification or qualification under the safety act or choose not to do so  we may nevertheless elect to provide the product or service when we think the related risks are manageable 
space business we provide products and services to nasa  mainly through our space systems and it gs business segments 
in  space systems was selected by nasa to design and build the agency s next generation human space flight crew transportation system known as orion  with an initial contract value of approximately billion 
orion is a key element of nasa s vision for space exploration  and is planned to succeed the space shuttle in transporting a new generation of human explorers to and from space 
in the fiscal year nasa budget proposal  orion is supported at a level of million 
we also have a equity interest in united space alliance  llc which provides ground processing and other operational services to the space shuttle program 
as with the dod and other government funded programs  our government space programs require annual funding  subject to specific congressional approval in annual appropriations acts 
we continued to receive new orders from the us military in for satellites to support missile defense  battlefield communications and other defense initiatives 
the environment for our commercial satellites business continues to be very competitive due mainly to low demand for new satellites as a result of excess capacity in the telecommunications industry 
we are managing our commercial satellite business with an expectation of receiving fewer orders due to market constraints 
for a discussion of the results of operations of our space systems segment  see the discussion of business segments section 
in december  we completed the formation of united launch alliance  llc ula  a joint venture with the boeing company boeing  which combines the production  engineering  test and launch operations associated with us government launches of our atlas launch vehicles and boeing s delta launch vehicles 
under the terms of the joint venture agreement  atlas and delta expendable launch vehicles will continue to be available as alternatives on individual launch missions 
the joint venture is a limited liability company in which we and boeing each own 
we contributed the assets of our atlas launch vehicle business to ula and ula assumed the liabilities of that business  in exchange for our ownership interest 
we are accounting for our investment in ula under the equity method of accounting 
the formation of ula did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position for in october  we sold our ownership interests in lockheed khrunichev energia international  inc lkei and ils international launch services  inc ils 
lkei is a joint venture we had with russian government owned space firms which has exclusive rights to market launches of commercial  non russian origin space payloads on the proton family of rockets 
one of the joint venture partners  khrunichev state research and production space center khrunichev  is the manufacturer 
table of contents of the proton launch vehicle and provider of the related launch services 
ils was a joint venture between lkei and us to market atlas and proton launch vehicles and services 
in periods prior to the sale of these interests  we consolidated the results of operations of lkei and ils into our financial statements based on our controlling financial interest 
contracts for proton launch services usually required substantial advances from the customer prior to launch which were included as a liability on our balance sheet in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred 
at december   those advances totaled million 
a sizeable percentage of the advances we received from customers for proton launch services were sent to khrunichev and included on our balance sheet in inventories for launches under contract 
at december   those payments to khrunichev totaled million 
if a contracted launch service was not provided  the related advance would have to be refunded to the customer by lkei 
in the event lkei did not refund the advance  we would have been responsible for making the payment to certain customers 
under the sale agreement  we will continue to be responsible to refund advances to certain customers if launch services are not provided and ils does not refund the advance 
due to this continuing involvement with those customers of ils  many of the risks related to this business have not been transferred and we did not recognize this transaction as a divestiture for financial reporting purposes 
we deferred recognition of a net gain of approximately million that otherwise would have been recognized on the sale of our interests in lkei and ils  and have continued to include the related assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
our ability to realize the deferred net gain is dependent upon khrunichev providing the contracted launch services and  in the event the launch services are not provided  ils s ability to refund the advance 
through december   all proton launch services through lkei were provided according to contract terms 
other business considerations as a government contractor  we are subject to us government oversight 
the government may ask about and investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations 
depending on the results of those audits and investigations  the government could make claims against us 
under government procurement regulations and practices  an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and suspended from being able to bid on  or be awarded  new government contracts for a period of time 
a conviction could result in debarment for a specific period of time 
similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business 
although we cannot predict the outcome of these types of investigations and inquiries with certainty  based on current facts  we do not believe that any of the claims  audits or investigations pending against us are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
we are exposed to risks associated with us government contracting  including technological uncertainties  dependence on fewer manufacturing suppliers and obsolescence  as well as congressional appropriation and allotment of funds each year 
many of our programs involve the development and application of state of the art technologies aimed at achieving challenging goals 
as a result  setbacks  delays  cost growth and product failures can occur 
we have entered into various joint venture  teaming and other business arrangements to help support our portfolio of products and services in many of our lines of business 
some of these business arrangements include foreign partners 
the conduct of international business introduces other risks into our operations  including changing economic conditions  fluctuations in relative currency values  regulation by foreign countries and the potential for unanticipated cost increases resulting from the possible deterioration of political relations 
the nature of our international business also makes us subject to the export control regulations of the us department of state and the department of commerce 
if these regulations are violated  it could result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges 
we are currently unaware of any violations of export control regulations which are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
critical accounting policies contract accounting revenue recognition approximately of our sales are derived from long term contracts for design  development and production activities  with the remainder attributable to contracts to provide other services that are not associated with design  development or production activities 
we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting method for a particular contract 

table of contents accounting for design  development and production contracts generally  we record long term  fixed price design  development and production contracts on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing sales 
for example  we use this method of revenue recognition on our c j tactical transport aircraft program and multiple launch rocket system program 
for certain other long term  fixed price development and production contracts that  along with other factors  require us to deliver minimal quantities over a longer period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract  sales are recorded when we achieve performance milestones or using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  we recognize sales based on the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion 
as examples  we use this methodology for our f raptor program and the aegis weapon system program 
in some instances  long term production programs may require a significant level of development and or a low level of initial production units in their early phases  but will ultimately require delivery of increased quantities in later  full rate production stages 
in those cases  the revenue recognition methodology may change from the cost to cost method to the units of delivery method after considering  among other factors  program and production stability 
as we incur costs under cost reimbursement type contracts  we record sales 
cost reimbursement type contracts include time and materials and other level of effort type contracts 
examples of this type of revenue recognition include the f lightning ii joint strike fighter system development and demonstration sdd program and the thaad missile defense program 
most of our long term contracts are denominated in us dollars  including contracts for sales of military products and services to foreign governments conducted through the us government ie  foreign military sales 
as a general rule  we recognize sales and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost to cost and milestone methods of percentage of completion accounting than when we use the units of delivery method 
in addition  our profits and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long term contracts undertaken  the costs incurred in their performance  the achievement of other performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees  particularly under incentive and award fee contracts  is finally determined 
incentives and award fees related to performance on design  development and production contracts  which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer  as well as penalties related to contract performance  are considered in estimating sales and profit rates 
estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and anticipated performance 
incentive provisions which increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are generally not recognized until the event occurs 
such incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance 
accounting for design  development and production contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
we have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability  the complexity of the work to be performed  the availability of materials  the length of time to complete the contract to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials  and the availability and timing of funding from our customer 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
we have accounting policies in place to address these as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long term contracts 
products and services provided under long term design  development and production contracts represent approximately of our sales for therefore  the amounts we record in our financial statements using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material 
because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if our underlying circumstances were to change 
for example  if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all design  development and production contracts was higher or lower by one percentage point  our net earnings would increase or decrease by approximately million 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required  any changes from prior estimates are included in earnings in the current period 

table of contents accounting for other services contracts revenue under contracts for services other than those associated with design  development or production activities is generally recognized either as services are performed or when a contractually required event has occurred  depending on the contract 
this methodology is mainly used by our information technology global services segment 
services contracts primarily include operations and maintenance contracts  and outsourcing type arrangements 
revenue under such contracts is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the period of contract performance  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs incurred under these services contracts are expensed as incurred  except that initial set up costs are capitalized and recognized ratably over the life of the agreement 
operating profit related to such services contracts may fluctuate from period to period  particularly in the earlier phases of the contract 
incentives and award fees related to performance on services contracts are recognized when they are fixed and determinable  generally at the date of award 
other contract accounting considerations the majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the us government 
cost based pricing is determined under the federal acquisition regulations far 
the far provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under us government contracts 
for example  costs such as those related to charitable contributions  advertising  interest expense  and public relations are unallowable  and therefore not recoverable through sales 
in addition  we may enter into agreements with the us government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters 
for example  most of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation related to discontinued operations and sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under far provisions and supporting agreements reached with the us government 
we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
business segment personnel assess the status of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews 
also  regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost  scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel independent from the business segment performing work under the contract 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are reviewed for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel  and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 
for other information on accounting policies we have in place for recognizing sales and profits  see our discussion under sales and earnings in note to the financial statements 
postretirement benefit plans most of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans pension plans  and we provide health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees 
our earnings may be negatively or positively impacted by the amount of expense or income we record for our employee benefit plans 
this is particularly true with expense or income for pension plans because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions and workforce demographics 
non union represented employees hired after january  do not participate in our defined benefit pension plans  but are eligible to participate in a new defined contribution plan in addition to our other retirement savings plans 
those employees have the ability to participate in our retiree medical plans  but we do not subsidize the cost of their participation 
we account for our pension plans using statement of financial accounting standards fas  employers accounting for pensions and fas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
fas was adopted as of december  fas requires that the amounts we record  including the expense or income for the plans  be computed using actuarial valuations 
these valuations include many assumptions  including assumptions we make relating to financial market and other economic conditions 
changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions we use 
the key year end assumptions used to estimate pension expense or income for the following calendar year are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in future compensation levels 
we use judgment in reassessing these assumptions each year because we have to consider current market conditions and  in the case of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  past investment experience  judgments about future market trends  changes in interest rates and equity market performance 
we also have to consider factors like the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants 
an example of how changes in these assumptions can affect our financial statements occurred in the discount rate assumption is based on available yields on high quality fixed income investments 
after reviewing yields on high quality 
table of contents long term bonds at the end of  and how those yields might apply to our projected pension cash flows  we increased our discount rate assumption to at december   compared to used at the end of this change  together with other factors such as the effects of the actual return on plan assets over the past few years  resulted in our projecting that the amount of pension expense for will decrease by approximately as compared to expense 
at the end of  prior to our adoption of fas  we recorded a noncash after tax adjustment in stockholders equity to reflect a minimum pension liability for many of our pension plans 
we calculated the minimum pension liability on a plan by plan basis by comparing the accumulated benefit obligation abo for each plan to the fair value of that plan s assets 
we recorded the amount by which the abo exceeded the fair value of the plan assets  after adjusting for previously recorded accrued or prepaid pension cost for the plan  as a minimum pension liability  with a corresponding increase in an intangible asset  if appropriate  and a reduction to stockholders equity 
in  the minimum pension liability decreased from the balance recorded at december   primarily due to a higher than expected return on benefit plan assets in and the increase in the discount rate assumption  and therefore we recorded a noncash after tax adjustment that increased stockholders equity by  million 
fas required us to recognize on a plan by plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax  in stockholders equity 
the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and the projected benefit obligation pbo of the plan 
upon its adoption  we recognized assets for all of our overfunded plans and liabilities for our underfunded plans on our balance sheet at december   recognized an adjustment to the ending balance of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity  net of tax  for previously unrecognized net actuarial losses and prior service cost or credits  and eliminated the minimum pension liability balance and intangible assets related to our plans that had been recorded prior to its adoption 
the previously unrecognized actuarial losses and prior service costs were netted against the plans funded status on our balance sheet in prior periods in accordance with fas at year end  the noncash after tax adjustment we recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the adoption of fas reduced stockholders equity by  million 
the net impact of the minimum liability recognized under fas and the adjustments recorded under fas was to reduce our stockholders equity by  million 
us government cost accounting standards cas are a major factor in determining our pension funding requirements and govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the us government 
funded amounts are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on us government contracts  and therefore are recognized in our net sales 
the total funding requirement for pension plans under cas in was million 
this is also the cas expense we recorded for the year and included in our segment results of operations 
that amount was funded through discretionary prepayments we made to the plans in for  we expect our funding requirements and expense under cas to decrease 
also in  funding in addition to the amount calculated under cas will likely be required under internal revenue code irc rules 
any additional amounts computed under the irc rules are considered to be prepayments under the cas rules  and are recorded on our balance sheet and recovered in future periods 
in  and  we made discretionary prepayments of million  million and million  respectively  to the pension trust 
prepayments reduce the amount of future cash funding that will be required under the cas and irc rules and  as a result  we expect to have no required cash contributions to the pension plans in the fas cas pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with fas and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with cas 
since the cas expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on us government contracts  and therefore recognized in a particular segment s net sales  the results of operations of our segments only include pension expense as determined and funded in accordance with cas rules 
accordingly  the fas cas adjustment is an amount included in the reconciliation of total segment operating profit to consolidated operating profit under gaap 
see the discussion of net unallocated corporate expense income under discussion of business segments 
in august  the president signed into law new legislation related to pension plan funding in response to the public s concern over the adequacy of such funding 
the new law has the effect of accelerating the required amount of annual pension plan contributions under the internal revenue code that most companies will be required to pay  effective in the legislation provides an exemption for us as well as other large us defense contractors that delays the requirement to accelerate funding 
the legislation also requires the cas board to modify its pension accounting rules by to better align the recovery of pension contributions on us government contracts with the new accelerated funding requirements 
the new funding requirements for large us defense contractors will be delayed until the earlier of or the year in which the changes to the cas rules are effective 

table of contents environmental matters we are a party to various agreements  proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues  including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the epa or by a state agency 
we record financial statement accruals for environmental matters in the period that it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated see the discussion under environmental matters in note to the financial statements 
judgment is required when we develop assumptions and estimate costs expected to be incurred for environmental remediation activities due to difficulties in assessing the extent of environmental remediation to be performed  complex environmental regulations and remediation technologies  cost allowability issues  agreements between prps to share in the cost of remediation as discussed below and other factors 
we enter into agreements eg  administrative orders  consent decrees which document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation 
we are also involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements exist but do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation 
environmental cleanup activities usually cover several years  which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to  for example  changing remediation technologies 
to determine the costs related to cleanup sites  we have to assess the extent of contamination  the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and evolving regulatory environmental standards 
we consider these factors in our estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation actions 
in cases where a date to complete activities at a particular environmental site cannot be estimated by reference to agreements or otherwise  we project costs over an appropriate time frame not to exceed years 
given the required level of judgment and estimation  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change eg  a change in environmental standards 
if we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a prp  we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable prps 
generally  prps that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share  on an allocated basis  the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation of hazardous materials 
under existing environmental laws  responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and  therefore  we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation 
in the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation  the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of contribution from the other prps 
the amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other prps  which we are required to pursue by agreement and us government regulation 
under agreements reached with the us government  most of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs 
under existing government regulations  these and other environmental expenditures relating to our us government business  after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other prps  are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services 
as a result  a substantial amount of the expenditures we incur are being included in our sales and cost of sales according to us government agreement or regulation 
at the end of  the total amount of liabilities recorded on our balance sheet for environmental matters was million 
about of the liability relates to sites in redlands  burbank and glendale  california  and in great neck  new york  mainly for remediation of soil and groundwater contamination 
the remainder of the liability relates to other properties including current operating facilities and certain facilities operated in prior years for which our obligation is probable and the financial exposure can be estimated 
we have recorded assets totaling million at december  for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for us government businesses 
the amount that is expected to be allocated to our commercial businesses has been expensed through cost of sales 
any recoveries we receive from other prps or insurance would reduce the allocated amounts included in our future us government sales and cost of sales 
acquisition and divestiture activities we continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers 
we accomplish this not only internally  through our independent research and development activities  but also through acquisitions 
we selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments that complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies 
we have made a number of such niche acquisitions of 
table of contents businesses during the past several years 
over the last five years  we have paid billion to complete such acquisitions 
conversely  we may also explore the sale of businesses  investments and surplus real estate 
if we were to decide to sell any such businesses or real estate  the resulting gains  if any  would be recorded when the transactions are consummated and losses  if any  would be recorded when the value of the related asset is determined to be impaired 
acquisitions in and  we completed acquisitions of the following businesses 
there were no significant acquisition activities in year ended december  pacific architects and engineers  inc  a provider of services to support military readiness  peacekeeping missions  nation building activities  and disaster relief services included in our it gs segment  savi technology  inc  a developer of active radio frequency identification solutions included in our is s segment  aspen systems corporation  an information management company that delivers a range of business process and technology solutions included in our it gs segment  isx corporation  a provider of military decision systems and other information technology solutions included in our electronic systems segment  and hmt vehicles  a military vehicle design company included in our electronic systems segment

the aggregate cash paid for the acquisitions  as well as for amounts paid in related to acquisitions completed in  was billion 
additional payments totaling approximately million are required to be made over the next three years related to these acquisitions  with approximately one half of that amount payable over the next months 
the aggregate cash paid for the acquisitions  as well as for amounts paid in related to acquisitions completed in prior periods  was million 
we accounted for these acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting  and therefore recorded purchase accounting adjustments by allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the acquisitions were not material to our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and divestitures during  and  we continued to execute the strategy to monetize certain of our equity investments and surplus real estate  as follows in  we sold the following our ownership interests in lkei and ils  as discussed in space business under industry considerations 
the gain on the sale was deferred pending the provision of launch services for certain customers  million shares of inmarsat plc  which resulted in a gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income and expenses  and increased net earnings by million per share  the assets of space imaging  llc  which resulted in a gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income and expenses  and increased net earnings by million per share  and certain surplus land in california and florida  which resulted in an aggregate gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income and expenses  and increased net earnings by million per share 
in  we sold the following our interest in neustar  inc  which resulted a gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income and expenses  and increased net earnings by million per share  
table of contents million of our inmarsat plc shares for million 
in addition  primarily as a result of a successful initial public offering by inmarsat  we recognized a gain of million which had previously been deferred 
together  these transactions resulted in gains  net of state income taxes  totaling million in other income and expenses  and increased net earnings by million per share  and our interest in intelsat  ltd  which resulted in a gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income and expenses  and increased net earnings by million per share 
in  we sold our shares of new skies satellites  nv new skies which resulted in a gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income and expenses  and an increase in net earnings of million per share 
results of operations since our operating cycle is long term and involves many types of development and production contracts with varying production delivery schedules  the results of operations of a particular year  or year to year comparisons of recorded net sales and profits  may not be indicative of future operating results 
the following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context 
all per share amounts cited in this discussion are presented on a per diluted share basis 
net sales in billions logo the following discussion of net sales and operating results provides an overview of our operations by focusing on key elements set forth in our statement of earnings 
the discussion of business segments which follows  describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated sales and operating profit for  and we follow an integrated approach for managing the performance of our business  and generally focus the discussion of our results of operations around major lines of business versus distinguishing between products and services 
as mentioned previously  most of our services revenues are generated in our information technology global services segment 
for  net sales were billion  a increase over sales 
sales for were billion  an increase of compared to sales  as compared to the prior years  increased in all segments except for anticipated reductions at aeronautics in both and the us government is our largest customer  accounting for about of our sales for  compared to in and in other income and expense  net was million for compared to million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from higher interest rates and amounts invested  and gains from the sale of land 
other income and expense  net increased million from to due to an increase in investment income  gains from the sale of investments primarily intelsat and inmarsat and charges in for the early retirement of debt 
effective january   we adopted fas r  share based payments  and related rules  on a modified prospective basis see note 
under this method  we recognize compensation cost related to the estimated fair value of nonvested stock options and restricted stock granted in and prior years 
prior to january   we measured compensation cost for stock options using the intrinsic value method  but disclosed the pro forma effects on net earnings and earnings per share as if compensation cost had been recognized based upon the fair value based method 
during the year ended december   we recorded compensation cost related to stock options and restricted stock totaling million which is included in the statement of earnings in cost of sales 
the net impact to earnings was million per share 
compensation cost related to restricted stock in prior periods was not material 
as of december   we had million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options  restricted stock units and restricted stock awards 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 

table of contents state income taxes are included in our operations as general and administrative costs and  under us government regulations  are allowable in establishing prices for the products and services we sell to the us government 
therefore  a substantial portion of state income taxes is included in our sales and cost of sales 
as a result  the impact on our operating profit earnings before interest and taxes of certain transactions and other matters disclosed in this form k is disclosed net of state income taxes 
our operating profit for was billion  an increase of compared to our operating profit for was billion  an increase of compared to interest expense for was million  million lower than interest expense for was million  million lower than in the decrease in interest expense in both years was primarily due to reductions in our debt outstanding 
our effective tax rates were for  for  and for the effective rates for and were lower than the statutory rate of primarily due to tax benefits related to extraterritorial income exclusion eti and the tax deductions for us manufacturing activities and dividends related to our employee stock ownership plan 
in addition  the rate for included a tax benefit related to claims we filed with the internal revenue service for additional eti tax benefits for sales in previous years 
this benefit decreased income tax expense by million per share  and reduced our effective tax rate for by 
for  our tax rate was reduced from the statutory rate by the tax benefits related to eti and tax deductible dividends 
in addition  the rate reflected a million per share reduction in our income tax expense primarily resulting from the closure of an internal revenue service irs examination  which reduced our effective rate by 
net earnings increased as compared to the prior year for the fifth consecutive year 
we reported net earnings of billion per share in  compared to net earnings of billion per share in and net earnings of billion per share in discussion of business segments we operate in five business segments aeronautics  electronic systems  space systems  information technology global services it gs and integrated systems solutions is s 
our aeronautics business segment designs  develops and produces advanced military aircraft  air vehicles and related technologies  primarily for us and allied country military services 
combat aircraft programs include the f  f and f aircraft 
the f lightning ii is currently in the system development and demonstration phase 
the successful first flight of the conventional take off and landing ctol variant aircraft took place in we have been producing the f raptor since  and delivered to the us air force in we also received a contract for production lot aircraft and advanced procurement funding for production lots  and a total of f fighting falcons were delivered in sales at aeronautics are expected to decline slightly in  with a more substantial decline expected in primarily due to a projected reduction in f revenue 
in the area of air mobility  we produce the c j super hercules aircraft 
we delivered aircraft in to the us military 
a total of have been ordered  with of those delivered through in addition to aircraft production  the segment provides logistics support  sustainment  and upgrade modification and services for its aircraft 
the electronic systems business segment has a broad portfolio of products and services 
many of their activities involve a combination of both development and production contracts with varying delivery schedules 
this business segment has continued to expand its core competencies as a leading systems integrator  as demonstrated with its role as the prime contractor on the littoral combat ship program  which launched its first ship in  and the presidential helicopter program 
the space systems business segment is a key supplier of space solutions  primarily to our us government customers 
growth will depend on our government satellite and missile defense businesses  as well as activities associated with the nasa orion program 
with the formation of ula and the sale of our interests in lkei and ils  growth in the segment will be less dependent on launch vehicles 
launch services to our us government customers are expected to be provided by ula 
the it gs and is s business segments continue to focus their capabilities in providing information technology services to defense  intelligence and other government customers  including expanding those capabilities through our acquisition activities over the past two years 
we expect continued strong growth in providing information technology solutions to government agencies 

table of contents in the following table of financial data  total operating profit of the business segments is reconciled to the corresponding consolidated amount 
the reconciling item net unallocated corporate expense includes the fas cas pension adjustment see the discussion of postretirement benefit plans under critical accounting policies  earnings and losses from equity investments  interest income  costs for stock based compensation programs  the effects of items not considered part of management s evaluation of segment operating performance  and corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments  as well as other miscellaneous corporate activities

total negotiated backlog was approximately billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
this amount included both funded backlog unfilled firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer congress in the case of us government agencies and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated 
negotiated backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts 
funded backlog was approximately billion at december  the aeronautics segment generally includes fewer programs that have much larger sales and operating results than programs included in the other segments 
therefore  due to the large number of comparatively smaller programs in the remaining segments  the discussions of the results of operations of these business segments generally focus on lines of business within the segments rather than on specific programs 
the following tables of financial information and related discussions of the results of operations of our business segments are consistent with the presentation of segment information in note to the financial statements 
segment operating profit in millions logo 
table of contents aeronautics aeronautics operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit backlog at year end net sales for aeronautics decreased by in compared to the anticipated decline in net sales was due to a decline in air mobility sales that was partially offset by an increase in combat aircraft sales 
air mobility sales declined by million primarily due to c j deliveries in compared to in and lower volume on the c program 
combat aircraft sales increased by million mainly due to higher f and f volume  partially offset by reduced volume on f programs 
net sales for aeronautics decreased by in compared to the decrease was mainly due to anticipated declines in combat aircraft  which were partially offset by growth in air mobility 
combat aircraft sales decreased by million for the year primarily due to declines in f volume  which more than offset higher f and f volume 
the sales growth in air mobility was due to additional c j deliveries in compared to in and higher volume on other air mobility programs 
operating profit for the segment increased by in compared to combat aircraft operating profit increased by million  mainly due to higher volume on the f and f programs  and improved performance on f programs 
the improvement for the year was also attributable in part to the fact that in  operating profit included a reduction in earnings on the f program 
air mobility operating profit increased million  mainly due to improved performance on c j sustainment activities in operating profit for the segment increased by in compared to the increase was due to higher air mobility operating profit that exceeded a decline in combat aircraft operating profit 
air mobility operating profit increased million mainly due to improved performance and increased deliveries on the c j program 
combat aircraft operating profit declined due to decreased f deliveries in compared to in and reduced earnings on the f development program  which more than offset increased volume and improved performance on the f program

the increase in backlog during over resulted primarily from increased orders on certain platform integration programs in pt ts 
space systems space systems operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit backlog at year end net sales for space systems increased by in compared to during the year  sales growth in satellites and strategic defensive missile systems s dms offset declines in space transportation 
the billion growth in satellites sales was mainly due to higher volume on both government and commercial satellite programs 
there were five commercial satellite deliveries in compared to no deliveries in higher volume in both fleet ballistic missile and missile defense programs accounted for the million sales increase at s dms 
in space transportation  sales declined million primarily due to lower volume in government space transportation activities on the titan and external tank programs 
increased sales on the atlas evolved expendable launch vehicle launch capabilities elc contract partially offset the lower government space transportation sales 
net sales for space systems increased by in compared to during the year  sales growth in satellites and s dms offset declines in space transportation 
the million increase in satellites sales was due to higher volume on government satellite programs that more than offset declines in commercial satellite activities 
there were no commercial satellite deliveries in  compared to four in increased sales of million in s dms were attributable to the fleet ballistic missile and missile defense programs 
the million decrease in space transportation s sales was mainly due to having three atlas launches in compared to six in operating profit for the segment increased in compared to operating profit increased in satellites  space transportation and s dms 
the million growth in satellites operating profit was primarily driven by the volume and performance on government satellite programs and commercial satellite deliveries 
in space transportation  the million growth in operating profit was attributable to improved performance on the atlas program resulting from risk reduction activities  including the first quarter definitization of the elc contract 
in s dms  the million increase in operating profit was due to higher volume and improved performance on both the fleet ballistic missile and missile defense programs 
operating profit for the segment increased in compared to operating profit increased in space transportation  s dms and satellites 
in space transportation  the million increase in operating profit was primarily attributable to improved performance on the atlas vehicle program 
satellites operating profit increased million due to the higher volume and improved performance on government satellite programs  which more than offset the decreased operating profit due to the decline in commercial satellite deliveries 
the million increase in s dms was attributable to higher volume on fleet ballistic missile and missile defense programs 
in december  we completed a transaction with boeing to form ula  a joint venture which combines the production  engineering  test and launch operations associated with us government launches of our atlas launch vehicles and boeing s delta launch vehicles see related discussion on our space business under industry considerations 
we are accounting for our investment in ula under the equity method of accounting 
as a result  our share of the net earnings or losses of ula are included in other income and expenses  and we will no longer recognize sales related to launch vehicle services provided to the us government 
in  we recorded sales to the us government for atlas launch services totaling approximately million 
we have retained the right to market commercial atlas launch services 
we contributed assets to ula  and ula assumed liabilities related to our atlas business in exchange for our ownership interest 
the net book value of the assets contributed and liabilities assumed was approximately million at 
table of contents december   the date of closing 
we accounted for the transfer at net book value  with no gain or loss recognized 
if our proportionate share of ula s net assets exceeds the book value of our investment  we would recognize the difference ratably over the next years in other income and expenses 
we currently anticipate that our ownership share of ula s net assets will exceed the book value of our investment in ula  but that amount remains subject to adjustment based on the final working capital and value of other assets which we and boeing contributed to ula 
in addition  under our agreement with boeing  we could be required to make an additional cash contribution to ula based on changes in the working capital of the business and other assets contributed 
any additional capital contribution would have the effect of increasing our investment and decreasing the difference between our investment and our share of ula s net assets 
this would decrease the amount that we would amortize and recognize in other income and expenses in the future 
we currently estimate that the amount by which our share of ula s net assets will exceed our investment will be between million and million 
both we and boeing also have agreed to provide approximately million in additional funding to ula 
as of december   we had provided million of additional funding to ula see note 
the formation of ula did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position for we sold our ownership interests in lkei and ils in october see related discussion on our space business under industry considerations 
lkei is a joint venture we had with russian government owned space firms which has exclusive rights to market launches of commercial  non russian origin space payloads on the proton family of rockets 
in periods prior to the sale of these interests  we consolidated the results of operations of lkei and ils into our financial statements based on our controlling financial interest 
in  we recorded sales related to proton launch services totaling approximately million 
the increase in backlog during as compared to was mainly due to order volume related to the orion program and government satellite programs  partially offset by a billion decrease in backlog resulting from the formation of ula and the sale of our interests in lkei and ils

unallocated corporate expense income  net the following table shows the components of net unallocated corporate expense income 
in millions fas cas pension adjustment items not considered in segment operating performance stock compensation expense other  net the fas cas pension adjustment represents the difference between pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with cas and pension expense determined in accordance with fas that difference is not included in segment operating results and therefore is a reconciling item between operating profit from the business segments and consolidated operating profit 
the cas funding amount is allocated among the business segments and is included as an expense item in the segments cost of goods sold 
a majority of the cost is also passed along to our customers through contract pricing  and is consequently included in the segments sales 
the following table shows the cas funding that is included as expense in the segments operating results  the related fas expense  and the resulting fas cas pension adjustment in millions fas expense less cas expense and funding fas cas pension adjustment expense fas expense decreased in primarily due to the change in the rate of future compensation increases as well as the growth in plan assets in  including contributions we made to the pension trust 
certain items are excluded from segment results as part of senior management s evaluation of segment operating performance consistent with the management approach promulgated by fas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
for example  gains and losses related to the disposition of businesses or investments managed by corporate  as well as other corporate activities such as charges recorded related to the early repayment of debt  are not considered by management in evaluating the operating performance of business segments

liquidity and cash flows we have a balanced cash deployment and disciplined growth strategy to enhance shareholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise 
consistent with that strategy  we have invested in our business eg  capital expenditures  independent research and development  made selective acquisitions of businesses  repurchased shares  increased our dividends and opportunistically reduced and refinanced our debt 
the following provides an overview of our execution of this strategy 
net cash provided by operating activities in millions logo operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to billion in as compared to after having increased by million to billion in as compared to in  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net earnings of million  and also to an increase in working capital improvements of million compared to the remaining change in cash between the periods was due to income tax payments  postretirement benefit plan contributions  and the timing of various other operating activities 
in  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net earnings of million as compared to  which more than offset a million reduction in working capital improvements between the years 
the remaining increase in cash between those periods was due to income tax payments and the timing of various other operating activities 
the focus on improving our cash management processes continues to contribute to the aggregate reduction in operating working capital accounts receivables  
table of contents inventories  accounts payable  and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred  including an aggregate reduction of million in as compared to a reduction of million in although we will continue to focus on management of operating working capital accounts  we do not expect the rate of improvements we have experienced in prior periods to continue 
investing activities capital expenditures capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment amounted to million in  million in and million in we expect our capital expenditures over the next three years to exceed expenditures consistent with the expected growth in our business and to support specific program requirements 
acquisitions  divestitures and other activities we have a process to selectively identify businesses for acquisition that meet our financial targets  help build a balanced portfolio and provide disciplined growth 
we paid  million  including amounts related to acquisitions completed in prior years  for the acquisition of new businesses in  compared with million in and million in during  we received proceeds of million from the sale of our remaining shares in inmarsat  million from the sale of assets of space imaging  llc  and million from the sale of lockheed martin intersputnik 
during  we received proceeds of million from the divestiture of non core equity investments 
the proceeds included million from the sale of our investment in intelsat  ltd  million from the sale of inmarsat shares and the redemption of certain inmarsat equity related investments  and million from the sale of our neustar investment 
during  we received million from the sale our investment in new skies satellites  nv and million related to the reduction of our investment in inmarsat group holdings  ltd 
financing activities issuance and repayment of long term debt cash provided from operations has been our principal source of funds to refinance and reduce our long term debt 
during  we paid million to complete an exchange of debt and million related to scheduled debt repayments 
in  we used million of cash for the early retirement and scheduled repayment of long term debt 
in  we used billion of cash for the early retirement and scheduled repayment of long term debt 
of that amount  million related to the early retirement of debt through tender offers for which we incurred million of associated costs 
share repurchases and dividends we also used cash in each of the last three years for common share repurchase activity as follows  million for million common shares in  all of which were settled during the year along with million for million shares purchased in   million for million common shares in  of which  million for million of those common shares  as well as million for million common shares purchased in  was settled during the year  and million for million common shares in  of which million for million common shares was settled during the year 
our share repurchase program authorizes the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock from time to time at management s discretion  including million of additional shares our board authorized for repurchase in as of december   we had repurchased a total of million shares under the program  and there remained approximately million shares that may be repurchased in the future 
the payment of dividends on our common shares is one of the key components of our balanced cash deployment strategy 
shareholders were paid cash dividends of million in  million in and million in we have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last three years 
we paid quarterly dividends of per share during each of the first three quarters of and per share for the last quarter of  per share during each of the first three quarters of and per share for the last quarter of  and per share during each of the first three quarters of and per share for the last quarter of capital structure and resources at december   we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately billion and short term investments of million 
our long term debt  net of unamortized discounts  amounted to billion 
our long term debt is mainly in the form of publicly issued notes and debentures 
we have billion of convertible debentures that have a floating interest rate based on libor  however  at december   we had an agreement in place to swap variable interest rates on the debentures for a fixed interest rate 
with this swap agreement  our entire long term debt portfolio effectively bears interest at fixed rates 

table of contents in august  we issued billion of new notes due the new notes 
the new notes were issued in exchange for a portion of certain then outstanding debt securities the old notes  and cash consideration of million 
holders also received a cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest on the old notes 
we accounted for the transaction as an exchange of debt under eitf  debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments 
the cash consideration of million is being amortized over the life of the new notes as a discount  using the effective interest method  and recorded in interest expense 
the new notes are included on our balance sheet under the caption long term debt  net and are presented net of the unamortized discount 
the expenses associated with the exchange  net of state income tax benefits  totaled million and reduced net earnings by million per share 
our stockholders equity amounted to billion at december   a decrease of billion from december  the decrease was primarily due to the adoption of fas  which required recognition of a billion adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss to recognize the net unrecognized actuarial losses and prior service costs  as well as the elimination of the previously recorded minimum pension liability and intangible asset  to record the unfunded status of our postretirement benefit plans 
that adjustment was partially offset by a billion minimum liability adjustment recorded prior to the adoption of fas  resulting in a net decrease of billion 
see the discussion of postretirement benefit plans under critical accounting policies and disclosure in note for additional information 
net earnings and stock plan activities more than offset the reduction in stockholders equity as a result of our share repurchases and the payment of dividends 
through our debt repayment activities  our long term debt balance has declined billion over the last five years from billion at december  our debt to total capitalization ratio was at december   unchanged from at december  debt to total capital ratio logo return on invested capital roic improved by basis points during to 
we define roic as net earnings plus after tax interest expense divided by average invested capital stockholders equity plus debt  after adjusting stockholder s equity by adding back amounts related to postretirement benefit plans  including those for minimum pension liabilities and  for  the adoption of fas we believe that reporting roic provides investors with greater visibility into how effectively lockheed martin uses the capital invested in its operations 
we use roic to evaluate multi year investment decisions and as a long term performance measure 
we also use roic as a factor in evaluating management performance under certain of our incentive compensation plans 
roic is not a measure of financial performance under us generally accepted accounting principles  and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 
roic should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of performance 
see consolidated financial data five year summary on page of this form k for additional information concerning how we calculate roic 

table of contents return on invested capital ratio logo at december   we had in place a billion revolving credit facility which expires in july there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at december  borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based  at our option  on the eurodollar rate or a bank base rate as defined 
each bank s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to  among other things  our compliance with various representations  warranties and covenants  including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets  and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio 
we have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper 
there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at december  if we were to issue commercial paper  the borrowings would be supported by the billion credit facility 
we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission to provide for the issuance of up to billion in debt securities 
if we were to issue debt under this shelf registration  we would expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes 
these purposes may include repayment of debt  working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions and any other general corporate purpose 
we actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable 
our management continually reviews changes in financial  market and economic conditions to manage the types  amounts and maturities of our indebtedness 
we may at times refinance existing indebtedness  vary our mix of variable rate and fixed rate debt  or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs 
cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and other available financing resources are expected to be sufficient to meet anticipated operating  capital expenditure and debt service requirements  as well as acquisition and other discretionary investment needs  projected over the next three years 
contractual commitments and off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had contractual commitments to repay debt  make payments under operating leases  settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services  and settle other long term liabilities 
capital lease obligations were negligible 
payments due under these long term obligations and commitments are as follows payments due by period in millions total less than year years years after years long term debt a other long term liabilities operating lease obligations purchase obligations operating activities capital expenditures total contractual cash obligations a the total amount of long term debt excludes unamortized discounts of million see note 

table of contents long term debt includes scheduled principal payments only 
generally  our long term debt obligations are subject to  along with other things  compliance with certain covenants  including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets 
amounts related to other long term liabilities in the preceding table represent the contractual obligations for certain long term liabilities recorded as of december  such amounts mainly include expected payments under deferred compensation plans  non qualified pension plans  environmental liabilities and business acquisition agreements 
obligations related to environmental liabilities represent our estimate of remediation payment obligations under government consent decrees and agreements  excluding amounts reimbursed by the us government in its capacity as a potentially responsible party 
purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and requirements contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages 
such agreements and contracts may  for example  be related to direct materials  obligations to sub contractors and outsourcing arrangements 
total purchase obligations in the preceding table include approximately billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our us government customers 
however  the us government would generally be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts for convenience pursuant to far 
for example  if we had commitments to purchase goods and services that were entered into as a result of a specific contract we received from our us government customer and the customer terminated the contract for their convenience  any amounts we would be required to pay to settle the related commitments  as well as amounts previously incurred  would generally be reimbursed by the customer 
this would also be true in cases where we perform sub contract work for a prime contractor under a us government contract 
the termination for convenience language may also be included in contracts with foreign  state and local governments 
we also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions  including contracts with commercial customers 
purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include amounts for facilities and equipment at various of our locations  related to customer contracts 
we also may enter into industrial participation agreements  sometimes referred to as offset agreements  as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries 
these agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country 
offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash  including transferring technology  providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in country projects  and the purchase by third parties eg  our vendors of supplies from in country vendors 
these agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in country vendors  providing financial support for in country projects  and building or leasing facilities for in country operations 
we do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive 
offset programs generally extend over several years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements 
no such penalties have been incurred during the last five years 
the amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and generally require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement 
at december   we had outstanding offset agreements totaling billion  primarily related to our aeronautics segment  that extend through to the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at december  that also satisfy offset agreements  those amounts are included in the preceding table 
with respect to the formation of ula  both we and boeing have committed to provide up to million each as additional capital contributions and million each in other financial support to ula  as required 
the non capital funding will be made in the form of a revolving credit agreement between us and ula or guarantees of ula financing with third parties  in either case  to the extent necessary for ula to meet its working capital needs 
we have agreed to provide this support for at least five years  and would expect to fund our requirements with cash on hand 
to satisfy our non capital financial support commitment  we and boeing put into place at closing a revolving credit agreement with ula 
at december   we had made million in payments under our capital contribution commitment  and no amounts had been drawn on the revolving credit agreement 
in addition  both we and boeing have cross indemnified ula related to certain financial support arrangements eg  letters of credit  surety bonds or foreign exchange contracts provided by either party and guarantees by us and boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ula under certain launch service contracts 
we believe ula will be able to fully perform its obligations and that it will not be necessary to fulfill the guarantees contemplated under the cross indemnities 
we have entered into standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers mainly relating to advances received from customers and or the guarantee of future performance on some of our 
table of contents contracts 
in some cases  we may also guarantee the contractual performance of third parties 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit  surety bonds and guarantees  as follows commitment expiration by period in millions total commitment less than year a years a years after years standby letters of credit surety bonds guarantees total commitments a approximately  million and million of standby letters of credit in the less than year and year periods  respectively  and approximately million of surety bonds in the less than year period  are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation 
included in the table above is approximately million representing letter of credit and surety bond amounts for which related obligations or liabilities are also recorded on the balance sheet  either as reductions of inventories  as customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred  or as other liabilities 
approximately billion of the standby letters of credit in the table above were to secure advance payments received under an f contract from an international customer 
these letters of credit are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance  and the amount available will be reduced as certain events occur throughout the period of performance in accordance with the contract terms 
similar to the letters of credit for the f contract  other letters of credit and surety bonds are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance 
under the agreement to sell our ownership interests in lkei and ils see related discussion on our space business under industry considerations  we will continue to be responsible to refund customer advances to certain customers if launch services are not provided and ils does not refund the advance 
we expect to recognize the million deferred net gain on the transaction when our responsibility to refund the advances expires  which we generally believe will be in based on the expected proton launch schedule  which is subject to change 
our ability to realize the deferred net gain is dependent upon khrunichev providing the contracted launch services or  in the event the launch services are not provided  ils s ability to refund the advance 
the amount we could be required to pay is expected to increase over time due to the payment of additional advances by the customers to ils related to the specific launches we have guaranteed  and will be reduced by the occurrence of those launches 
at december   the total amount that could be payable under the guarantees  approximating the total contract value of the guaranteed launches  was million 
that amount may be partially mitigated by approximately million of cash we retained that  absent any requirements to make payments under the guarantees  will be paid to the buyer over time as the launches occur 
our balance sheet at december  included current and noncurrent assets relating to lkei and ils totaling million  and current and noncurrent liabilities totaling million  both of which will be reduced as the launch services are provided 
the assets relate primarily to advances we have made to khrunichev for future launches  and the liabilities relate primarily to advances we have received from customers for future launches 
any potential earnings impact resulting from our inability to realize the assets we have recorded related to lkei and ils would be partially mitigated by our not recognizing the deferred gain on the transaction 
through december   proton launch services provided through ils were provided according to contract terms 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed rate and floating rate long term debt 
at december   we had an agreement in place to swap variable interest rates on our billion of convertible debentures based on libor for a fixed interest rate through august  with this swap agreement  our long term debt portfolio effectively bears interest at fixed rates 
we have designated the agreement as a cash flow hedge of the forecasted libor based variable interest payments 
based on our evaluation at the inception of the hedging agreement and in subsequent periods  we expect the hedging relationship to be highly effective in achieving the offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged variable interest payments  resulting in a fixed net interest expense reported on the statement of earnings 
we determined that the hedging relationship remained effective at december  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is adjusted at each balance sheet date  with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was not material 
we use forward foreign exchange contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and generally do so in ways that qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
these exchange contracts hedge the fluctuations in 
table of contents cash flows associated with firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions contracted in foreign currencies  or hedge the exposure to rate changes affecting foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities 
related gains and losses on these contracts  to the extent they are effective hedges  are recognized in income at the same time the hedged transaction is recognized or when the hedged asset or liability is adjusted 
to the extent the hedges are ineffective  gains and losses on the contracts are recognized in the current period 
at december   the fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding  as well as the amounts of gains and losses recorded during the year then ended  were not material 
we evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have minimal credit risk 
we periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
accounting pronouncements pending adoption in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which is effective january  the purpose of fin is to clarify and set forth consistent rules for accounting for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this interpretation  which is required to be reported separately as a noncash adjustment to the opening balance of our retained earnings in  is currently not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures  including internal control over financial reporting  that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic filings with the sec is reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms  and to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly executed and recorded 
our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management  including our chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo  as appropriate  to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
in designing and evaluating such controls and procedures  we recognize that any controls and procedures  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives  and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 
also  we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities 
as we do not control or manage these entities  our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries 
we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency  while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment 
changes may include such activities as implementing new  more efficient systems  consolidating the activities of two or more business units  and migrating certain processes to our shared services centers 
in addition  when we acquire new businesses  we review the controls and procedures of the acquired business as part of our integration activities 
we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures  including internal control over financial reporting  as of december  the evaluation was performed with the participation of senior management of each business segment and key corporate functions  and under the supervision of the ceo and cfo 
based on our evaluation  we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december  during  we also performed a separate evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  including performing self assessment and monitoring procedures 
based on those activities and other evaluation procedures  our management  including the ceo and cfo  concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december  management s report on our financial statements and internal control over financial reporting appears on page in addition  both our assessment and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting were audited by our independent registered public accounting firm 
their report appears on page there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected  or are reasonably likely to materially affect  our internal control over financial reporting
