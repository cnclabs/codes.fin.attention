item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this discussion is to focus on important factors affecting the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
reclassification in certain circumstances  reclassifications have been made to prior period information to conform to the presentation 
critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are listed below 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within the statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset  or relieving a liability 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded loan commitments the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance and reserve is based on two basic principles of accounting i statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and ii sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses on impaired loans be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows  or values observable in the secondary market  and the loan balance 
the company s allowance for loan losses has three basic components the formula allowance  the specific allowance  and the unallocated allowance 
each of these components is determined based on estimates that can and do change 
the formula allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses along with various qualitative factors  including levels and trends in delinquencies  nonaccrual loans  charge offs and recoveries  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of changes in underwriting standards  experience of lending staff  and economic conditions  and portfolio concentrations 
in the formula allowance  the historical loss rate is combined with the qualitative factors  resulting in an adjusted loss factor for each risk grade category of loans 
the adjusted loss factor is multiplied by the period end balances for each risk grade category 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss for specifically identified impaired loans 
the unallocated allowance includes estimated losses whose impact on the portfolio has yet to be recognized in either the formula or specific allowance 
the use of these values is inherently subjective and actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
the reserve for unfunded loan commitments is an estimate of the losses inherent in off balance sheet loan commitments at the balance sheet date 
it is calculated by multiplying an estimated loss factor by an estimated probability of funding  and then by the period end amounts for unfunded commitments 
the reserve for unfunded loan commitments is included in other liabilities 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  accordingly  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the annual impairment analysis for goodwill and core deposit intangibles acquired with the acquisition of community first is scheduled for the second quarter of additionally  under sfas  acquired intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles are separately recognized if the benefit of the assets can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  and amortized over their useful lives 
branch acquisition transactions were outside the scope of sfas and  accordingly  intangible assets related to such transactions continued to amortize upon the adoption of sfas the cost of purchased deposit relationships and other intangible assets  based on an independent valuation by a qualified third party  are being amortized over their estimated lives 
amortization expense charged to operations was  and  for the twelve month periods ended december  and  respectively 

index non gaap presentations the management s discussion and analysis may refer to the efficiency ratio  which is computed by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and noninterest income excluding gains on sales of securities or other assets 
this is a non gaap financial measure which management believes provides investors with important information regarding the company s operational efficiency 
comparison of the company s efficiency ratio with those of other companies may not be valid because other companies may calculate the efficiency ratio differently 
the analysis of net interest income in this document is performed on a tax equivalent basis 
management believes the tax equivalent presentation better reflects total return  as many financial assets have specific tax advantages that modify their effective yields 
a reconcilement of tax equivalent net interest income to net interest income is provided

analysis of operating results the results of operations for the year ended december   include the affect of the acquisition of community first financial corporation  which occurred april   and do not include the results of operations of community first prior to april  net interest income net interest income  the company s largest source of revenue  is the excess of interest income recorded on interest earning assets over interest expense recorded on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is influenced by a number of factors  including the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  interest rates earned on earning assets  and interest rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
for analytical purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to recognize the income tax savings on tax exempt assets  such as state and municipal securities 
a tax rate of was used in adjusting interest on tax exempt assets to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
net interest income divided by average earning assets is referred to as the net interest margin 
the net interest spread represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased  or from to the net interest margin  on a taxable equivalent basis  improved slightly from to 
the improvement in net interest income was due largely to the acquisition of community first  which significantly increased the company s interest earning assets 
the bank s highest yielding assets  loans  increased on average from  to  a increase 
net interest income for also includes a positive impact of  related to the valuation of the loans acquired from community first 
similarly  interest expense reflects a  reduction related to the valuation of certain community first deposits 
beginning april   the loan valuation is being amortized over fifty two months and the deposit valuation over thirteen months 
excluding these adjustments  the interest margin was in to meet its funding needs for the community first acquisition  the company issued  of trust preferred securities during the second quarter of interest expense associated with these securities was  for the following presentation is an analysis of net interest income and related yields and rates  on a taxable equivalent basis  for the years through nonaccrual loans are included in average balances

market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in interest rates and market prices 
the company is generally not subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
as a financial institution  interest rate risk and its impact on net interest income is the primary market risk exposure 
the magnitude of the change in earnings resulting from interest rate changes is impacted by the time remaining to maturity on fixed rate obligations  the contractual ability to adjust rates prior to maturity  competition  and the general level of interest rates 
the company s asset liability investment committee alco is primarily responsible for establishing asset and liability strategies and for monitoring and controlling liquidity and interest rate risk within established policy guidelines 
alco is also responsible for evaluating the competitive interest rate environment and reviewing investment securities transactions

loans include loans held for sale and are net of unearned income 
the company uses simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of projected earnings to changes in interest rates 
simulation takes into account current balance sheet volumes and the scheduled maturities and payments of assets and liabilities 
it incorporates numerous assumptions including growth  changes in the mix of assets and liabilities  prepayments  and average rates earned and paid 
based on this information  the model projects net interest income under multiple interest rate scenarios 

index table shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income as of december   assuming gradual and parallel changes in interest rates  and consistent levels of assets and liabilities 
table estimated changes in net interest income dollars in thousands as of december  change in changes in interest net interest income rates amount percent up up down down represents the difference between estimated net interest income for the next months in the new interest rate environment and the current interest rate environment 
the projected changes in net interest income due to simulated changes in interest rates at december   were within established policy guidelines 
net interest income for the following twelve months is projected to increase when interest rates are higher than current rates and decrease when interest rates are lower than current rates 
management cannot predict future interest rates or their exact effect on net interest income 
computations of future effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
certain limitations are inherent in such computations 
assets and liabilities may react differently than projected to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag changes in market interest rates 
also  the methodology uses estimates of various rates of withdrawal for money market deposits  savings  and checking accounts  which may vary significantly from actual experience 
the company is subject to prepayment risk  particularly in falling interest rate environments or in environments where the slope of the yield curve is relatively flat or negative 
such changes in the interest rate environment can cause substantial changes in the amount of prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities  which may in turn affect the company s interest rate sensitivity position 
additionally  credit risk may increase if an interest rate increase adversely affects the ability of borrowers to service their debt 
noninterest income noninterest income was  in  compared with  in and  in the increase of  for is largely due to an increase in trust fees  increases in deposit account service charge income  increased mortgage banking revenue  and income from bank owned life insurance policies acquired from community first

asset quality and credit risk management the purpose of the allowance for loan losses is to provide for probable losses in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and by recoveries of previously charged off loans 
loan charge offs decrease the allowance 
the company s lenders are responsible for assigning risk ratings to loans using the parameters set forth in the company s credit policy 
the risk ratings are reviewed for accuracy  on a sample basis  by the company s loan review department  which operates independently of loan production 
these risk ratings are used in calculating the level of the allowance for loan losses 
the credit committee has responsibility for determining the level and adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
among other factors  that committee  on a quarterly basis  considers the company s historical loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  individual risk ratings  nonperforming loans  impaired loans  other problem credits  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  and national and local economic conditions 
the audit and compliance committee and the board of directors also review the allowance calculation quarterly 
no single statistic  formula or measurement determines the adequacy of the allowance 
management makes difficult  subjective  and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain  and different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
for analytical purposes  management allocates a portion of the allowance to specific loan categories and specific loans the allocated allowance 
the entire allowance is used to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio  including identified and unidentified losses 
the allowance is supplemented to adjust for imprecision particularly in commercial  commercial real estate  and construction lending and to provide for a range of possible outcomes inherent in estimates used for the allocated allowance 
this reflects the result of management s judgment of risks inherent in the portfolio  economic uncertainties  and other qualitative factors  including economic trends in the company s regions 
the relationships and ratios used in calculating the allowance  including the qualitative factors  may change from period to period 
furthermore  management cannot provide assurance that  in any particular period  the company will not have sizeable credit losses in relation to the amount reserved 
management may find it necessary to significantly adjust the allowance  considering current factors at the time  including economic conditions  industry trends  and ongoing internal and external examination processes 
the southside virginia market  in which the company has a significant presence  is under economic pressure 
the region s economic base has historically been weighted toward the manufacturing sector 
increased global competition has negatively impacted the textile industry and several manufacturers have closed plants due to competitive pressures or the relocation of some operations to foreign countries 
other important industries include farming  tobacco processing and sales  food processing  furniture manufacturing and sales  specialty glass manufacturing  and packaging tape production 
additional declines in manufacturing production and unemployment could negatively impact the ability of certain borrowers to repay loans 

index the allowance is subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer banks 
the provision for loan losses was  in   in  and  in the provision was largely attributable to a  loan secured by a hotel in a major north carolina metropolitan area 
the loan was determined to be impaired and was placed on nonaccrual status at december  this loan was sold at a discount  and the remaining balance charged off in the amount charged off was less than the specific reserve established for the loan  contributing to the reduction in the provision expense for the decrease in the provision for is due to an improvement in credit quality  as indicated by a reduction in nonperforming loans and by other internal measurements

off balance sheet transactions were as follows in thousands off balance sheet transactions december  december  commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to purchase securities mortgage loan rate lock commitments commitments to extend credit to customers represent legally binding agreements with fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being funded  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future funding requirements

the decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income was largely due to the adoption of sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  which resulted in a  net of tax  reduction 
the company declared and paid quarterly dividends totaling 
and 
per share of common stock in and  respectively 
cash dividends in totaled  and represented a payout of net income  compared to in and in the company intends to pay dividends that are competitive in the banking industry while maintaining an adequate level of capital to support growth 
one measure of a financial institution s capital level is the ratio of shareholders equity to assets 
shareholders equity was of assets at december  and at december  in addition to this measurement  banking regulators have defined minimum regulatory capital ratios for financial institutions 
these ratios take into account risk factors identified by those regulatory authorities associated with the assets and off balance sheet activities of financial institutions 
the guidelines require percentages  or risk weights  be applied to those assets and off balance sheet assets in relation to their perceived risk 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers 
tier i capital consists primarily of shareholder s equity  while tier ii capital consists of qualifying allowance for loan losses 
total capital is the total of tier i and tier ii capital 
another indicator of capital adequacy is the leverage ratio  which is computed by dividing tier i capital by average quarterly assets less intangible assets 
the regulatory guidelines require that minimum total capital tier i plus tier ii of be held against total risk adjusted assets  at least half of which must be tier i capital 
at december   the company s tier i and total capital ratios were and  respectively 
at december   these ratios were and  respectively 
the ratios for both years exceeded the regulatory requirements 
the company s leverage ratios were and at december  and  respectively 
the leverage ratio has a regulatory minimum of  with most institutions required to maintain a ratio of  depending upon risk profiles and other factors 
as mandated by bank regulations  the following five capital categories are identified for insured depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
these regulations require the federal banking regulators to take prompt corrective action with respect to insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
under the regulations  well capitalized institutions must have tier i risk based capital ratios of at least  total risk based capital ratios of at least  leverage ratios of at least  and not be subject to capital directive orders 
management believes  as of december  and  that the company met the requirements to be considered well capitalized 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
the most significant effect of inflation is on other expenses that tend to rise during periods of inflation 
changes in interest rates have a greater impact on a financial institution s profitability than do the effects of higher costs for goods and services 
through its balance sheet management practices  the company has the ability to react to those changes and measure and monitor its interest rate and liquidity risk
