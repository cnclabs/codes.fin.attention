item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading casual dining restaurant company headquartered in nashville  tennessee 
we own and operate three restaurant concepts under the o charley s  ninety nine and stoney river legendary steaks trade names 
as of december   we operated o charley s restaurants in states in the southeast and midwest regions  ninety nine restaurants in nine northeastern states  and ten stoney river restaurants in the southeast and midwest 
as of december   we had six franchised o charley s restaurants including five franchised o charley s restaurants in michigan and one franchised o charley s restaurant in ohio 
as of december   we had three joint venture o charley s restaurants in louisiana  and one joint venture o charley s restaurant in wisconsin  in all of which we have an ownership interest 
on february   we reported our fiscal earnings in our unaudited press release 
subsequently  we concluded that we needed to reclass share based compensation expense associated with sfas r 
historically  we have classified all share based compensation on our consolidated statements of earnings in the general and administrative expense line 
on march  the securities exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab to address the interaction of sfas r and certain securities and exchange commission rules and regulations 
one of the items addressed in sab in item f was the classification of share based compensation expense on the income statement 
item f stated that companies should present the expense related to share based payment arrangements in the same line or lines as cash compensation paid to the same employees 
we therefore concluded that our past practice was incorrect and have made reclasses in the current and prior year presentations throughout this k to reflect those reclasses 
the following table sets forth the impact to each affected line item as a result of the reclassification adjustments year ended december  december  december  in thousands payroll and benefits restaurant operating costs cost of commissary sales advertising and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses net impact upon earnings we believe the improvement in our results for reflect our progress in our turnaround and transformation efforts 
our turnaround strategy is focused on strengthening the organization with a new core of talent and building a winning team 
during  we continued to build our core of executive talent as we hired a concept president o charley s  chief supply chain officer  senior corporate counsel  chief information officer  vice president of human resource development  vice president of communications and vice president of strategic sourcing 
we now believe that we have in place a management team that is substantially complete and that will be able to execute successfully our turnaround and transformation efforts 
we have already benefited from the new ideas and strategies that our new team members have brought to o charley s which we believe is reflected in the improvement in our fiscal consolidated operating margin 
we are now working to optimize the performance of every member of our organization in order to achieve our long term vision to be the best of class in food and service in our segments of the restaurant industry 
improving the box economics through the execution of product and labor cost management and increasing same restaurant sales through new product offerings  new marketing  and a more analytical approach to menu pricing 

as a percentage of restaurant sales  cost of food and beverage and payroll and benefits costs in were both lower than in the prior year on a consolidated basis 
this was the result of a higher average check in all three of our concepts  the impact of our theoretical food cost system and our increased focus on team member and management labor productivity as well as changes we made to our restaurant level incentive plans 
we have also made the decision to gradually phase out our kids eat free program by mid which we believe will in the short term decrease the number of our guest visits but will increase our average check and operating margin 
our intent is to increase same restaurant sales through new product offerings  our limited time or seasonal product offerings and increase in service levels 
our project revo lution and project dress to the nines teams continue to focus on box economics by  among other initiatives  developing new team member selection and training tools  introducing new kitchen technology and engineering  capitalizing on dining room efficiencies and applying these improvements along with our rebrandings of our o charley s and ninety nine restaurants 
another important aspect of our rebranding is the introduction of concept specific elements including new uniforms  plateware  menu designs  curbside to go service and new service standards 
we have now completed project revo lution rebrandings at our o charley s restaurants  and dressed to the nines rebrandings at our ninety nine restaurants 
we plan to complete an additional five rebrandings at o charley s  and three rebrandings at ninety nine during the first quarter of while we still consider the rebrandings completed to date a test  we continue to be pleased with the increased sales volume following the reopening of these restaurants 
we have also developed a new prototype restaurant which features new interior and exterior color schemes  new exterior signage and a number of interior changes designed to enhance the guest experience and improve operational efficiencies in both the dining room and kitchen 
all of the planned new o charley s and ninety nine restaurants for will feature this new prototype design 
enhancing guest satisfaction and intent to return by instilling a passion to serve sm 
in  we adopted the vision statement a passion to serve sm 
this statement describes our commitment to our guests  each other  our stakeholders and our communities 
our vision is to be the best of class in food and service in our segments of the restaurant industry 
we are holding ourselves to higher standards as measured by our guest satisfaction index or gsi 
our project rev olution and project dressed to the nines initiatives are designed to improve the guest experience 
our senior management teams at ninety nine and o charley s have followed this roll out with a combination of in store and market focus groups designed to solicit feedback about how we can continue to improve our delivery of great food and service 
we believe that an increase in the average check requires sustainable improvement in the guest experience 
we believe that we are taking the appropriate steps to generate profitable and sustainable growth while enhancing shareholder value

the calculation of change in the same restaurant sales  guest visits and average check per guest for excludes the prior year sales and guest visits for o charley s restaurants closed during or after hurricane katrina for the days they were closed 
the average check per guest is computed using all restaurants open at the end of the year 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year revenues during  total revenues increased million  or percent  to million from million in in  we increased average check at all of our concepts  partially offset by a decrease in guest visits at all of our concepts 
the increase in check average and decrease in guest counts was primarily attributable to the partial phase out of the kids eat free program at our o charley s concept  the reduction of promotional coupons and a more analytical approach to menu pricing at all of our concepts in in  we had weeks as compared to weeks in fiscal and the estimated revenue increase associated with the rd week was million 
we also had a net addition of ten company owned restaurants in o charley s company operated restaurant sales increased million  or percent  to million during as compared to million in  as a result of an increase in average check of percent offset by a decrease in same restaurant guest visits of percent

cost of food and beverage during  our cost of food and beverage was million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared with million in the same prior year period  or percent of restaurant sales  in this basis point improvement in food and beverage cost as a percentage of sales in the year reflects the impact of higher average checks and lower costs for poultry  cheese and cooking oils and by a further narrowing of the gap between our theoretical and actual food costs at the o charley s concept  partially offset by higher costs for beef and seafood  and higher fuel related distribution costs 
payroll and benefits during  payroll and benefits were million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared to million in the same prior year period  or percent of restaurant sales  in reflecting an improvement of basis points 
payroll and benefits costs as a percentage of restaurant sales were lower at the o charley s concept when compared to the prior year 
reductions in employee benefits expense  management salaries  and restaurant level bonus expense were partially offset by higher hourly wage expenses and share based compensation 
the reduction in management salaries reflects reductions in the average number of managers per restaurant in the o charley s concept  while the reduction in bonus expense reflects the impact of our new performance focused bonus plans 
the cost of our employee benefit plans was lower as a percentage of restaurant sales in than in  reflecting reductions negotiated with certain health care plans earlier in  and the implementation of our new benefit plans on september  restaurant operating costs during  restaurant operating costs were million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared to million in the same prior year period  or percent of restaurant sales  in the same prior year period

advertising and marketing expenses during  advertising and marketing expenditures increased percent to million from million in and  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to percent from percent in prior year 
the ten basis point increase as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to additional advertising and marketing expenditures to support our limited time menu offerings 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased percent to million in from million in  and as a percentage of total revenues  increased to percent from percent in the prior year 
this basis point increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of severance  recruiting and relocation expenses related to our recent management changes  an increase in incentive compensation expense  an increase in share based compensation expense and an increase in legal expenses  partially offset by decreases in other areas 
the increase in legal expense is primarily attributable to previously disclosed legal proceedings 
see footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of these legal proceedings 
the increase in share based compensation expense is primarily attributable to restricted share expense and also includes the expensing of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan discount as a result of the adoption of financial accounting standards board statement no 
r  share based payment 
depreciation and amortization during  depreciation and amortization expense was million as compared to million in and was flat as a percentage of total revenues at percent 
the increase in deprecation and amortization is primarily attributable to the company s capital expenditures in and asset impairment and disposals our results of operations for the year ended december  include net charges of million for asset impairment and disposals 
this amount includes an asset impairment charge of approximately million related to the three planned o charley s restaurant closures  million relating to one o charley s restaurant and two ninety nine restaurants that are impaired but will remain open  and million relating to the impairment of purchased software and assets related to the company s rebranding efforts 
the million charge in was offset by a net gain of million on assets held for sale and other assets that were sold or settled 
in  the company recorded impairment and disposal charges of million related to six restaurant closures  a corporate aircraft  two restaurants that remained open and other non operating assets 
pre opening costs during  our pre opening costs decreased approximately million to million  or percent of total revenues  compared with million in the same prior year period  or percent of total revenues  in the percent decrease is due to company owned restaurant openings in as compared to company owned restaurant openings in interest expense our interest costs were million in as compared to million in interest expense during reflects million of senior subordinated notes at a fixed rate of percent  approximately million weighted average debt outstanding on our million revolving credit facility  and other debt including capitalized lease obligations and prepaid financing costs 
approximately million of the percent senior subordinated notes have been effectively converted through interest rate swap agreements into a variable interest rate obligation based on the six month libor rate in arrears plus percent 
on october   we entered into a five year million secured revolving credit facility  which amended and restated our million secured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on november  this new facility is less costly to us than the facility that it replaced  and we believe that it provides us with greater financial flexibility 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under the new credit facility 
income taxes during  our income tax expense increased million to million  or percent of total revenues  compared with million  or percent of total revenues  in our effective tax rate was percent in compared to percent in this increase was primarily attributable to higher pretax earnings

stoney river restaurant sales increased million  or percent  to million during  as a result of same restaurant sales increases of percent 
the percent same restaurant sales increase was comprised of a percent improvement in the average check and a percent increase in guest counts 
cost of food and beverage while our cost of food and beverage in was lower than by percent as a percentage of sales it was higher than we anticipated  due in part to our traffic building promotions  higher distribution costs and higher costs associated with the opening of the bellingham distribution center 
reductions in poultry costs were offset by increases in produce costs resulting from weather related crop damage  and increased seafood costs 
payroll and benefits during  payroll and benefits increased basis points as a percentage of restaurant sales compared to the same prior year period 
higher average wage and benefit rates and declines in productivity contributed to the increase as well as an increase in the hourly health care plans in as compared to restaurant operating costs restaurant operating costs as a percentage of restaurant sales increased basis points during increases in packaging costs  higher energy costs and repairs and maintenance costs resulted in the year over year increase 
the higher packaging costs were the result of an increase in packaging material costs combined with increases in our to go sales 
the increase in energy costs were primarily associated with natural gas price increases 
advertising and marketing expenses during  our advertising and marketing costs decreased million to million  or percent of total revenues  compared with million  or percent of total revenues  in the decrease in advertising and marketing expenditures as a percentage of total revenues is primarily due to the use of the same promotional calendar on a year over year basis  enabling us to utilize some print and television media which were produced in the prior years 
general and administrative expenses during  our general and administrative costs increased million to million  or percent of total revenues  compared with million  or percent of total revenues  in general and administrative expenses increased in as compared to primarily because of million in severance and consulting expenses associated with the financial system conversion project 
we also incurred approximately million in severance and recruiting expenses in associated with previously announced management changes 
in  we incurred severance and related costs of approximately million associated with the organizational changes that were implemented during the third and fourth quarter of depreciation and amortization during  our depreciation and amortization costs increased million to million  or percent of total revenues  compared with million  or percent of total revenues  in the percent increase is primarily attributable to additions of long lived assets of million during asset impairment and disposals during  we recorded impairment and disposal charges of million 
the impairment and disposal charges consisted of a million charge related to the planned closure of six under performing o charley s restaurants  million for two o charley s restaurants that remain open  million for losses relating to the o charley s store in biloxi  mississippi that was destroyed by hurricane katrina  and a million impairment charge to write down the value of a corporate aircraft  which we intend to sell  to reflect the difference between its current book value and the estimated net sale proceeds 
these charges also include net losses of approximately million on asset sales 
pre opening costs during  our pre opening costs increased million to million  or percent of total revenues  compared with million  or percent of total revenues  in the percent increase is due to timing of restaurant openings and the increased costs incurred for opening the first stoney river restaurant since interest expense during  our interest costs increased million to million  or percent of total revenues  compared with million  or percent of total revenues  in the percent increase is due to higher short term interest rates on our variable rate debt 
interest expense during reflects million of senior subordinated notes at a fixed rate of percent  approximately million weighted average debt outstanding on our million revolving credit facility at one month libor plus percent  and other debt including capitalized lease obligations and prepaid financing costs 
approximately million of the percent senior subordinated notes have been effectively converted through interest rate swap agreements into a variable interest rate obligation based on the six month libor rate in arrears plus percent 
income taxes during  our income tax expense decreased million to million  or percent of total revenues  compared with million  or percent of total revenues  in our effective tax rate of percent in dropped to percent in this decrease was primarily attributable to higher tax credits and lower pre tax earnings 
outlook we expect to report net earnings per diluted share of between and for the week period ending april   and net earnings per diluted share of between and for the fiscal year ending december  projected results for the quarter and the year are based upon anticipated same restaurant sales increases of less than percent for the o charley s and ninety nine concepts  and continued year over year improvement in restaurant level margins 
in  we expect to open between four and six new o charley s company operated restaurants  between three and five new ninety nine restaurants  and one or two new stoney river restaurants 
although we have not yet decided to proceed with a full roll out of these projects  we anticipate between and project revo lution rebrandings at o charley s 
we also expect to complete approximately dressed to the nines rebrandings at ninety nine 
the training expenses and asset write offs associated with these rebrandings are expected to have a negative impact on net earnings in we have locked in our pricing for approximately percent of our annual requirements for poultry and approximately percent of our annual requirement for pork 
compared to  our contracted pricing for is approximately flat for poultry and more than percent lower for pork 
given the current conditions in the beef market we have only locked in pricing for most of the projected needs for the first quarter of our guidance for the first quarter and full year does not reflect any impact for charges or expenses arising from decisions we may make during as part of our turnaround efforts 
our earnings guidance for the fiscal year represents a reduction from the preliminary guidance that we offered on october  due to a more challenging sales environment  and the subsequent passage of minimum wage increases in a number of states 
adjusting for the impact of the rd week  and the charges for asset impairments and disposals and severance and related costs in  our full year guidance for anticipates an increase in net earnings per diluted share of between percent and percent 
we plan to continue to execute all elements of our plan  including improving the overall guest experience in our restaurants  managing our margins  and instilling a passion to serve throughout our organization 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have historically been cash provided by operations  borrowings under our credit facilities and capital leases 
our principal capital needs have historically arisen from property and equipment additions  acquisitions  and payments on long term debt and capitalized lease obligations 
in addition  we lease a substantial number of our restaurants under operating leases and have substantial operating lease obligations 
like many restaurant companies  our working capital has historically had current liabilities in excess of current assets due to the fact that most of our sales are received as cash or credit card charges  and we have reinvested our cash in new restaurant development 
we do not believe this indicates a lack of liquidity 
to the extent operations generate cash in excess of working capital and development needs  we have historically invested this cash in overnight repurchase agreements 
as previously announced  we have slowed our restaurant development in order to focus on improving the performance of our existing restaurants 
we opened three company owned o charley s restaurants  five ninety nine restaurants and three stoney river restaurant during on october   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of october  the credit agreement 
the credit agreement amended and restated our existing senior secured credit facility entered into on november  the credit agreement provides for a five year  million revolving credit facility and permits us to request an increase in the principal amount of the facility of up to million 
at december   we had no amounts outstanding on the revolving credit facility except for approximately million in letters of credit which reduced our available borrowings under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement includes certain customary representations and warranties  negative covenants and events of default 
it requires us to comply with certain financial covenants  including adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio  a senior secured leverage ratio  a fixed charge coverage ratio and capital expenditures ratio 
we were in compliance with such covenants at december  the interest rates per annum applicable to loans outstanding under the credit agreement will  at our option  be equal to either a base rate or a libor rate  in each case plus an applicable margin percent to percent in the case of base rate loans and percent to percent in the case of libor rate loans  depending on our senior secured leverage ratio 
at december   our margin applicable to libor loans was percent 
in addition to the interest payments required under the credit agreement  we are required to pay a commitment fee on the aggregate average daily unused portion of the credit facility equal to percent to percent per annum  depending on our senior secured leverage ratio 
our obligations under the credit agreement are secured by liens on substantially all of our assets  including a pledge of the capital stock of our material subsidiaries but excluding real property acquired after november  
except as otherwise provided in the credit agreement  the credit agreement will mature on october  from time to time  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with certain financial institutions 
during the first quarter of  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a financial institution that effectively convert a portion of the fixed rate indebtedness related to the million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due into variable rate obligations 
the total notional amount of these swaps was million and is based on the six month libor rate in arrears plus a specified margin  the average of which is percent 
the terms and conditions of these swaps mirror the interest terms and conditions on our percent senior subordinated notes due and are accounted for as fair value hedges 
these swap agreements expire in november our weighted average interest rate for the years ended december  and december  was percent and percent  respectively 
in october  we announced an authorization to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
any repurchases will be made from time to time in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions at our discretion 
to date  we have not repurchased any shares of our common stock under this authorization 
any repurchases will be funded by cash provided by operations or proceeds from short term borrowings under our credit facility and will be reported in the company s quarterly reports on form q or annual report on form k for the period in which any such repurchase occurs in accordance with applicable sec rules 
in  net cash flows used by investing activities included capital expenditures incurred principally for building new restaurants  improvements to existing restaurants  new equipment and improvements at our quality product center  and technological improvements at our restaurant support center 
the company did not finance any capital expenditures during the year ended december  during the year ended december   new equipment financed through capitalized lease obligations was million 
capital expenditures for the years ended december  and december  were as follows december  december  in thousands new restaurant capital expenditures other capital expenditures total capital expenditures we expect capital expenditures in to be between million and million 
as part of our focus on improving results in our existing restaurants  we plan to develop and open fewer restaurants in than we have developed prior to we expect to open between four and six new company owned o charley s restaurants  between three and five new ninety nine restaurants  and one or two new stoney river restaurants in our capital expenditure projections for include between and project rev olution rebrandings for our o charley s concept and approximately dressed to the nines rebrandings for our ninety nine concept

these purchase obligations are primarily food obligations with fixed volume with variable pricing that can fluctuate within a contracted range and a fixed beverage contract 
in situations where the price is based on market prices  we use the existing market prices at december  to determine the amount of the obligation 
of the total unconditional purchase obligations shown  million is based on variable pricing 
this pertains to our revolving credit facility 
at december   we had no amounts outstanding on this revolving credit facility 
we have approximately million of outstanding letters of credit as of december  which reduces the capacity of the revolving credit facility but is not funded debt 
as of december   we have approximately million remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
as noted in footnote in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements this credit facility was amended and restated on october  with a maturity date of october  joint ventures and franchise arrangements in connection with our franchising initiative  we may from time to time enter into joint venture arrangements to develop and operate o charley s restaurants 
for any franchisee in which we have an ownership interest  we may make loans to the joint venture entity and or guarantee certain of its debt and obligations 
to date  we have invested in two joint ventures for the development of o charley s restaurants 
on august   we invested in a joint venture for the development of three o charley s restaurants in certain markets in southern louisiana 
on november   we invested in a joint venture for the development of three o charley s restaurants in wisconsin 
under the terms of the limited liability company agreements for both of the joint ventures  ownership of the joint venture entity is shared equally between us and our joint venture partner 
the joint venture entity is managed by a board of managers composed of two individuals designated by the joint venture partner and two individuals designated by us 
the joint venture partner was required to make capital contributions in the aggregate amount of  to the joint venture entity and we agreed to make initial loans to the joint venture entity in the maximum principal amount of  the loans are secured by substantially all of the assets of the joint venture entity and are partially guaranteed by the joint venture partner 
in order to assist this first joint venture jfc enterprises  llc to open its restaurants  we decided to make additional loans to the joint venture  and as of december   we had advanced a total of approximately million to the joint venture 
in addition  the joint venture has been given access to a million loan through ge capital franchise finance corporation which we guarantee 
these loans funded most of the investment in the building and equipment  and the start up and operating losses incurred in the joint venture s restaurants 
although we are not obligated to do so  we are likely to fund future operating losses 
in similar fashion to our first joint venture  in order to assist our second joint venture wi tenn restaurants  llc to open its restaurants  we decided to make additional loans to the joint venture  and as of december   we had advanced a total of approximately million to the joint venture 
this loan funded most of the investment in the building and equipment  and the start up and operating losses incurred in the joint venture s restaurants 
under fin r  both joint ventures are variable interest entities  as we do not anticipate them having sufficient equity to fund their operations 
since we bear a disproportionate share of the financial risk associated with the joint ventures  we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the joint ventures  and in accordance with fin r  we consolidate the joint ventures in our consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period see note to our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on historical experience  outside advice from parties believed to be experts in such matters  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows lease accounting share based compensation property and equipment goodwill and trademarks impairment of long lived assets tax provision and related financial statement items lease accounting on february   the office of the chief accountant of the sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain accounting principles relating to three aspects of lease accounting the period of time used for the amortization of leasehold improvements  the recognition of rent expense when the lease term in an operating lease contains a period of free or reduced rents commonly referred to as a rent holiday  and accounting for landlord improvement incentives to tenants 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
the fasb concludes in this fsp that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period should be expensed 
our policy for lease accounting involves recognizing rent on a straight line basis from the time we are committed to a leased property  which is when all contingencies associated with the delivery of the property by the landlord are taken care of  to the end of the lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
the term  for purposes of straight line rent calculations and the useful life over which leasehold improvements are depreciated  is the shorter of the estimated useful life of the leased property or the base lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
we also recognize tenant allowances as a deferred rent liability and amortize them over the lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
share based compensation prior to the adoption of sfas r  we did not record stock option expense and presented a proforma disclosure 
we did however record the expense of restricted non vested awards 
effective december   the company adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation cost at fair value for all share based payments including stock options 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective method of adoption 
as a result  share based compensation for fiscal includes compensation expense  recognized over the applicable vesting periods  for share based awards granted prior to  but not vested as of december   as well as compensation cost for new share based awards granted during under the black scholes merton option pricing model we estimated volatility using only historical share price performance over the expected life of the option 
results of prior periods do not reflect any restated amounts upon adoption of sfas no 
r under the modified prospective method 
the company s policy is to recognize compensation cost for restricted awards with only service conditions and a graded vesting schedule on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
in addition  sfas no 
r also requires that compensation expense be recognized for only the portion of options and restricted awards that are expected to vest 
therefore  an estimated forfeiture rate derived from historical employee terminations is applied against share based compensation expense 
the forfeiture rate is applied on a straight line basis over the service vesting period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was in substance  multiple awards 
we have retained a third party to estimate our forfeiture rate 
in addition  upon the adoption of sfas no 
r we began expensing the discount associated with our employee stock purchase plan based on the actual discount received 
property and equipment the company has million of property and equipment net of accumulated depreciation at december  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  our property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the following estimated useful lives building and improvements years  furniture  fixtures and equipment to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset s estimated useful life or the expected lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
equipment under capital leases is amortized to its expected value at the end of the lease term 
gains or losses are recognized upon the disposal of property and equipment  and the asset and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts 
maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not enhance the value of or increase the life of the assets are expensed as incurred 
inherent in the policies regarding property and equipment are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including useful life  residual value to which the asset is depreciated  the expected value at the end of the lease term for equipment under capital leases  and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of assets 
these significant estimates and judgments  coupled with the fact that the ultimate useful life and economic value at the end of a lease are typically not known until after the passage of time  through proper maintenance of the asset  or through continued development and maintenance of a given market in which a restaurant operates can  under certain circumstances  produce distorted or inaccurate depreciation and amortization or  in some cases result in a write down of the value of the assets under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
see critical accounting policy impairment of long lived assets below 
we believe that our accounting policy for property and equipment provides a reasonably accurate means by which the costs associated with an asset are recognized in expense as the cash flows associated with the asset s use are realized 
goodwill and trademarks as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
at december   we have million in goodwill and million in indefinite life intangible assets shown on our consolidated balance sheets related primarily to the acquisition of ninety nine restaurants 
the determination of the estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments based upon short and long term projections of future performance 
certain of these forecasts reflect assumptions regarding our ability to successfully integrate the ninety nine concept and to maintain the financial performance that this concept has experienced over its recent history 
we have relied on the judgments of outside valuation experts in evaluating the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets 
changes in strategy  new accounting pronouncements and or market conditions may result in future impairment of recorded asset balances 
on january   we acquired ninety nine restaurants for million in cash and approximately million shares of our common stock 
we completed a valuation of the assets and liabilities of ninety nine and allocated the purchase price to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  including million related to trademarks  with the remaining amount of million being allocated to goodwill 
we selected the first day of each new fiscal year as the date on which we will test the goodwill and trademarks for impairment 
we completed a valuation of the goodwill pursuant to sfas no 
as of january   the first day of fiscal and our valuation showed that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its net book value and no impairment charge was needed 
impairment of long lived assets as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the judgments made related to the ultimate expected useful life and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying value of an asset are affected by such issues as ongoing maintenance of the asset  continued development of a given market within which a restaurant operates  including the presence of traffic generating businesses in the area  and our ability to operate the restaurant efficiently and effectively 
we assess the projected cash flows and carrying values at the restaurant level  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the long lived assets associated with a restaurant may not be recoverable 
we believe that our accounting policy for impairment of long lived assets provides reasonable assurance that any assets that are impaired are written down to their fair value and a charge is taken in operating earnings on a timely basis 
during the year ended december   we took an impairment charge of million for three o charley s restaurants that we plan to close and for one o charley s restaurant and two ninety nine restaurants that will remain open 
we also recorded charges for purchased software that is not longer in use and for asset write offs relating to our project revo lution and dressed to the nines rebranding efforts 
the million charge in was offset by a net gain of million on assets held for sale and assets sold or otherwise settled that were not held for sale 
during the year ended december   we took an impairment charge of million for eight o charley s restaurants and a corporate aircraft 
tax provision and related financial statement items we must make estimates of certain items that comprise our income tax provision and the related current and deferred tax liabilities 
these estimates include employer tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on employee tip income  work opportunity and welfare to work credits  as well as estimates related to certain depreciation and capitalization policies 
these estimates are made based on the best available information at the time of the provision and historical experience 
we file our income tax returns many months after our year end 
these returns are subject to audit by various federal  state and local governments several years after the returns are filed and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
we then must assess the likelihood of successful legal proceedings or reach a settlement  either of which could result in material adjustments to our consolidated financial statements 
as part of the computation of the income tax provision  we identify and measure deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we weigh available evidence in determining the realization of deferred tax assets 
available evidence includes historical  current and future financial performance of the company 
we also consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
if we determine it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be recognized  the deferred tax asset will be reduced by a valuation allowance 
at december   the company had deferred tax valuation allowance of million 
recently issued accounting pronouncements on march   the fasb issued eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation that clarifies how a company discloses its recording of taxes collected that are imposed on revenue producing activities 
eitf is effective for the first interim reporting period beginning after december  the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertain tax positions  as defined 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have not yet determined the impact this interpretation will have on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  fas 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in us generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have not yet determined the impact sfas no 
will have on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab provides guidance regarding the consideration given to prior year misstatements when determining materiality in current year financial statements  and is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp american institute of certified public accountants industry audit guide aug air accounting for planned major maintenance activities fsp aug air 
fsp aug air amends the guidance on the accounting for planned major maintenance activities  specifically it precludes the use of the previously acceptable accrue in advance method 
fsp aug air is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in february   the fasb issued sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we have not yet determined the impact sfas no 
will have on our results of operations or financial position 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  equipment  land construction costs  and fuel energy costs could adversely affect our operations 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
several states are considering changes to their minimum wage and or benefit related laws which  if enacted  could have an adverse impact on the company s payroll and benefit costs 
as a result of increased competition and the low unemployment rates in the markets in which our restaurants are located  we have continued to increase wages and benefits in order to attract and retain management personnel and hourly employees 
in addition  most of our leases require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance  repairs and utility costs  and these costs are subject to inflationary pressures 
commodity inflation has had a significant impact on our operating costs 
we also believe that increased fuel costs over the past months have had a negative impact on consumer behavior and have increased the cost of operating our quality product center 
we attempt to offset the effect of inflation through periodic menu price increases  economies of scale in purchasing and cost controls and efficiencies at our restaurants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing  and cash management activities 
we utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposures to changes in interest rates 
our fixed rate debt consists primarily of capitalized lease obligations and senior subordinated notes and our variable rate debt consists primarily of our revolving credit facility 
as an additional method of managing our interest rate exposure on our credit facility  at certain times we enter into interest rate swap agreements whereby we agree to pay over the life of the swaps a fixed interest rate payment on a notional amount and in exchange we receive a floating rate payment calculated on the same amount over the same time period 
the fixed interest rates are dependent upon market levels at the time the swaps are consummated 
the floating interest rates are generally based on the monthly libor rate and rates are typically reset on a monthly basis  which is intended to coincide with the pricing adjustments on our revolving facility 
at december   the company did not have any swaps outstanding to manage the interest rate exposure of our credit facility 
at december  and december   we had interest rate swap agreements with a financial institution that effectively converted a portion of the fixed rate indebtedness related to our million senior subordinated notes due into variable rate obligations 
the total notional amount of these swaps is million and is based on six month libor rates in arrears plus a specified margin  the average of which is percent 
the terms and conditions of these swaps mirror the interest terms and conditions on the notes 
these swap agreements expire in november
