item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we design and manufacture proprietary automated anastomotic systems used by surgeons to perform coronary bypass surgery 
in coronary artery bypass grafting  or cabg  procedures  veins or arteries are used to construct alternative conduits to restore blood flow beyond closed or narrowed portions of coronary arteries  bypassing the occluded portion of the coronary artery that is impairing blood flow to the heart muscle 
our products provide cardiovascular surgeons with easy to use automated systems to perform consistent  rapid and reliable connections  or anastomoses  of the vessels  which surgeons generally view as the most critical aspect of the bypass procedure 
we currently sell our c port xa distal anastomosis system  or c port xa system  in the united states and europe 
the c port xa  the current generation of our c port system  was cleared by the us food and drug administration  or fda  in november we also sell the c port flex a distal anastomosis system  or c port flex a system  in the united states 
the c port flex a system was cleared by the fda in april each of the c port systems is used to perform a distal anastomosis  which is the connection of a bypass graft vessel to a coronary artery downstream of the occluded portion of the coronary artery 
in addition  we currently sell our pas port proximal anastomosis system  or the pas port system  in europe and japan  and we completed enrollment of a clinical trial of this system in the united states and europe in march the pas port system is used to perform a proximal anastomosis  which is the connection of a bypass graft vessel to the aorta or other source of blood 
in june  we entered into a license  development and commercialization agreement with cook incorporated  or cook  relating to development of a specialized device designed to close the patent foramen ovale  or pfo 
under the agreement  we agreed to develop the pfo device with cook  and cook has exclusive worldwide commercialization rights to market any product that is developed in collaboration 
we have received payments totaling  which have been recorded as deferred development revenue on the balance sheet as of june  we did not recognize any development revenue under the agreement in fiscal year cook may also pay us up to a total of an additional million in future payments if additional development milestones are achieved 
we may potentially receive a royalty based on cook s annual worldwide sales of any pfo device that is developed in collaboration 
in december  we entered into a license  development and commercialization agreement with cook relating to development of our x port tm vascular access closure device  or cook vascular closure device  a product candidate that is currently in clinical studies 
under the agreement  we agreed to develop the cook vascular closure device with cook  and cook has exclusive commercialization rights to market any product that is developed in collaboration for medical procedures anywhere in the body 
we have received payments totaling million 
we recorded as development revenue under the agreement million and million in fiscal year and  respectively 
a total of  had been recorded as deferred development revenue on the balance sheet as of june  we are also entitled to receive from cook up to a total of an additional  in future payments if the final development milestone under the agreement is achieved 
we may potentially receive a royalty based on cook s annual worldwide sales of the cook vascular closure device  if any 
guidant investment is our largest investor  having invested an aggregate of approximately million in our preferred stock in june and august additionally  in august  guidant extended a line of credit to us for million 
we have drawn down this line of credit  and as of june   we had long term notes payable  or notes  of million and accrued interest payable of million outstanding to guidant investment 
the notes bear interest at per annum and would have matured in august in november  we entered into a note conversion agreement with guidant investment pursuant to which guidant investment converted million of the outstanding principal amount under the notes into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the remaining principal balance of million along with accrued interest of approximately million was paid in cash to guidant investment in full satisfaction of all 
table of contents amounts owing under the notes  and the notes were cancelled 
the closing market price of the common stock on the delivery date was per share  resulting in a gain on early retirement of the notes payable of million which has been recorded in the statement of operations for fiscal year guidant corporation  or guidant  distributed our products in europe under a distribution agreement that was signed in may  amended in january and terminated in september guidant terminated the distribution agreement prior to the expiration of its original term 
in addition  we entered into a development and supply agreement with guidant to develop an aortic cutter for guidant s heartstring product  and we manufactured the first  aortic cutters 
guidant has outsourced future production of the aortic cutter to a third party contract manufacturer  and we receive a royalty for each unit sold  but we no longer manufacture the aortic cutter 
we recorded royalty revenue from guidant of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
we manufacture c port systems and pas port systems with parts we manufacture and components supplied by vendors  which we then assemble  test and package 
for fiscal year  we generated net revenue of million  including million of development revenue from cook  and incurred a net loss of million 
we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they require us to make significant judgments and estimates that are used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab no 
 revenue recognition  sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we generally use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
we use shipping documents and third party proof of delivery to verify that title has transferred 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the agreement associated with the transaction 
to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we would defer the recognition of revenue until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
we record product revenue net of estimated product returns and discounts from the list prices for our products 
the amounts of product returns and the discount amounts have not been material to date 
revenue generated from development contracts is recognized upon acceptance of milestone payments by the customer in accordance with contractual terms  only to the extent of actual costs incurred to date 
amounts paid but not yet expended on the project are refundable and are recorded as deferred revenues until such time as project milestones are achieved 
inventory 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost computed on a standard cost basis  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market which is determined as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
standard costs are monitored on a quarterly basis and updated as necessary to reflect changes in raw material costs and labor and overhead rates 
inventory write downs are established when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
inventory write downs are measured as the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value 
inventory write downs are charged to cost of product revenue and establish a lower cost basis for the inventory 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory write downs that could adversely impact our financial results 

table of contents clinical trial accounting 
clinical trial costs are a component of research and development expenses and include fees paid to participating hospitals and other service providers that conduct clinical trial activities with patients on our behalf and the cost of clinical trial insurance 
the various costs of the trial are contractually based on the nature of the services  and we accrue the costs as the services are provided 
accrued costs are based on estimates of the work completed under the service agreements  patient enrollment and past experience with similar contracts 
our estimate of the work completed and associated costs to be accrued includes our assessment of information received from our third party service providers and the overall status of our clinical trial activities 
if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate costs associated with various trials at a given point in time 
although our experience in estimating these costs is limited  the difference between accrued expenses based on our estimates and actual expenses have not been material to date 
stock based compensation 
during fiscal year  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  r  share based payments  which revises sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured on the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee requisite service period 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion  or apb  no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and financial accounting standard board  or fasb  interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb no 

we adopted sfas r applying the prospective method under which we will continue to account for nonvested equity awards outstanding at the date of adoption of sfas r in the same manner as they had been accounted for prior to adoption  that is  we will continue to apply opinion in future periods to equity awards outstanding at the date we adopted sfas r 
the expected term of options granted is determined using the simplified method allowed by sab no 
under this approach  the expected term would be presumed to be the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
the simplified approach is not permitted for options granted  modified or settled after december  since the company is a newly public entity with limited historical data on volatility of its stock  the expected volatility used in fiscal year and is based on volatility of similar entities referred to as guideline companies 
in evaluating similarity  the company considered factors such as industry  stage of life cycle  size  and financial leverage 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on a risk free zero coupon spot interest rate at the time of grant 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
sfas r also requires us to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense related to stock based compensation 
we recognize the stock compensation expense for option awards using the accelerated method over the requisite service period of the award  which generally equals the vesting period of each grant 
in addition  sfas r requires us to reflect the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as both a financing cash inflow and an operating cash outflow upon adoption 
we recorded stock based compensation expense of  or per share and  or per share for fiscal years and  respectively 
total compensation expense related to unvested awards not yet recognized is approximately million at june  and is expected to be recognized over the next months 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  certain stock options were granted with exercise prices that were below the estimated fair value of the common stock at the date of grant 
we recorded deferred stock compensation  net of cancellations due to terminated employees  of million and  for fiscal years and  respectively  in accordance with apb  and will amortize these amounts on a straight line basis over the related vesting period of the options 
we recorded employee stock compensation expense associated with the amortization of deferred stock compensation of   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the total unamortized deferred stock compensation recorded for all option grants through june  is expected to be amortized as follows  in fiscal year   in fiscal year and  in fiscal year 
table of contents stock compensation arrangements to non employees are accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  using a fair value approach 
the compensation costs of these options and warrants granted to non employees  including lenders and consultants  are re measured over the vesting terms as earned  and the resulting value is recognized as an expense over the period of services received or the term of the related financing

research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs within our product development  regulatory and clinical groups and the costs of clinical trials 
research and development expenses increased  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the net increase in expenses in fiscal year was attributable to an increase of million in clinical trial costs for the pas port system in the united states and europe and increased travel expenses primarily in support of the clinical trial efforts  offset in part by decreased net facility related charges as the result of supporting the manufacturing activities of the c port system and lower non cash stock based compensation charges of  we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in absolute terms in future periods as we conduct new clinical studies for the c port xa and the pas port systems  continue to enhance our existing product lines and seek to develop new applications of our technology

these loans were repaid with common stock in october  and there was no additional stock based compensation expense for these loans after october we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as we expand our sales and marketing efforts and continue to address the requirements of being a public company  including costs associated with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of interest income 
interest income increased  or  to million for fiscal year from  for fiscal year the increase in interest income in fiscal year was primarily attributable to higher average investment balances for the full fiscal year as a result of funds received from the initial public offering completed in february and higher overall market interest rates for the period

cost of product revenue decreased  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease in costs in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to no costs incurred for the aortic cutter and higher production cost absorption due to a higher number of clinical and prototype units produced during the period charged to research and development expense  offset in part by higher product sales of the c port in the united states and higher charges taken in fiscal year for obsolete pas port and c port units 
research and development expense

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including auction rate preferred securities  corporate debt securities and debt instruments of the us government and its agencies 
due to the short term nature of these instruments  a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the total value of our portfolio as of june  we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions to any material extent 
accordingly  we believe that  while the instruments we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
although substantially all of our sales and purchases are denominated in us dollars  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products outside the united states 
we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
as of june   the principal amounts  fair values and related weighted average interest rates of our investments in debt securities classified as marketable securities available for sale were as follows in thousands duration less than year to years total principal amount fair value average interest rate
