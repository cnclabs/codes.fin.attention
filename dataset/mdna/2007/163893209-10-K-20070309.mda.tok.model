the company s strategy is to strengthen its business portfolio and continue to reduce operating costs 
to achieve these goals  the company is focusing its resources on its core businesses by divesting non core businesses and assets  and acquiring businesses and assets that will enhance its business portfolio 
divestitures and acquisitions on february   the company signed an asset purchase agreement to sell its epdm business and portions of its rubber chemical business to an affiliate of lion chemical capital  llc 
the transaction is expected to close in the first half of and is subject to certain conditions  including regulatory approvals  financing and a financial audit 
on january   the company announced that it had completed the acquisition of the stock of kaufman holdings corporation kaufman in an all cash transaction 
the kaufman acquisition complements the company s existing petroleum additives segment in that it offers related products in key customer areas  providing the opportunity to strengthen alliances with major suppliers and may offer potential distribution synergies 
on october   the company sold its interest in davis standard llc for aggregate proceeds of million  of which million was received as of december  the company recognized a pretax gain of million on the transaction  which is included in other expense  net in its consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  davis standard llc was established on april  when the company combined our polymer processing equipment business with hamilton robinson s black clawson converting machinery company which resulted in our acquisition of a percent non controlling interest in the combined equity of the entity 
on may   the company sold its industrial water additives iwa business  which was acquired in the merger  to bwa water additives bwa  a subsidiary of close brothers private equity located in the united kingdom 
the company received adjusted cash proceeds of million 
the company recognized a pre tax loss of million on the transaction  which is included in gain loss on sale of businesses  net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  strategic initiatives in addition to focusing on its core businesses  the company is investigating strategic cost savings initiatives that could result in cost reductions at some manufacturing facilities 
as a result of planned divestitures of its non core businesses and strategic cost saving initiatives  the company has accelerated the depreciation and the recognition of the asset retirement obligations related to certain assets at several of its global facilities for which it is probable that there will be a change in the estimated useful lives of those facilities 
in addition  the company has estimated that it will incur severance and related costs due to employee reductions 
as a result of these initiatives  the company recorded pre tax charges for accelerated depreciation of million  accretion of asset retirement obligations of million  and severance and related costs of million in operating profit on its consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  these costs represent the estimated costs based on the facts and circumstances that existed as of december  as divestiture agreements and cost savings plans are formalized  such costs will be revised as necessary to reflect final plans 
c financial information about industry segments information as to the sales  operating profit  depreciation and amortization  assets  capital expenditures and earnings on investments carried on the equity method attributable to each of our business segments during each of our last three fiscal years is set forth in note the business segment data footnote included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our businesses are grouped into six reporting segments plastic additives non flame retardant plastic additives and flame retardant plastic additives  polymers epdm and urethanes  specialty additives petroleum additives and rubber chemicals  crop protection  consumer products  and other optical monomers  industrial water additives  fluorine chemicals and polymer processing equipment

net sales of petroleum additives during  and were  and of the company s total net sales  respectively 
rubber chemicals our rubber chemicals business includes approximately products for use in processing rubber 
these products include accelerators  antioxidants  antiozonants  chemical foaming agents  and specialty waxes 
accelerators are used for curing natural and synthetic rubber  have a wide range of activation temperatures and curing ranges  and use forms that give our customers the flexibility to make many different products 
antiozonants protect rubber compounds from flex cracking and ozone  oxygen and heat degradation 
antioxidants provide rubber compounds with protection against oxygen  light  and heat 
foaming agents produce gas by thermal decomposition or via a chemical reaction with other components of a polymer system and are mixed with rubber to produce sponge rubber products 
waxes inhibit static atmospheric ozone cracking in rubber 
we are a global supplier of rubber chemicals  and we believe our customers value our ability to provide high quality  consistent products world wide to complement their international expansion 
tire manufacturers accounted for approximately of our rubber additives sales in  with the balance consisting of manufacturers of industrial rubber goods  including hoses  belting  sponges  and a wide variety of other engineered rubber products 
on february   the company signed an asset purchase agreement to sell its epdm business and all rubber chemicals businesses associated with products produced at our geismar  louisiana facility as well as flexzone antiozonants produced worldwide to an affiliate of lion chemical capital  llc 
the transaction is expected to close in the first half of and is subject to certain conditions  including regulatory approvals  financing and a financial audit 
net sales of rubber chemicals during  and were   and of the company s total net sales  respectively 
crop protection the crop protection segment had net sales for of million compared to million for and million for increased sales in included of gains primarily related to the merger and other acquisitions 
our crop protection business focuses on specific niches in five major product lines fungicides  miticides and other insecticides  growth regulants  herbicides and fumigants 
we have primarily developed our products for use on high value cash crops  such as tree and vine fruits  ornamentals  nuts and turf  and secondarily for commodity crops  such as soybeans and corn 
our dedicated sales force works with growers and distributors to coordinate the use of our products throughout a crop s growth cycle and to address selective regional  climate  and growth challenges 
crop protection products typically are sold pursuant to contracts with extended payment terms in latin america and europe 
customary  extended payment periods  which are tied to particular crop growing cycles  make our crop protection business susceptible to losses from receivables during economic downturns and may adversely affect our operating results and our cash flows 
we expand our presence in worldwide niche markets by developing new crop protection products and obtaining registrations for new uses and geographies  where demand for our products and services has potential for growth 
we develop and sell our own products  and we also sell and register products manufactured by others on a licensed basis 
our seed treatments are used to coat seeds in order to protect the seed during germination and initial growth phases 
seed treatment is an environmentally attractive form of crop protection  involving localized use of agricultural chemicals at much lower use rates than other agrichemical treatments 
we anticipate growth in seed treatment resulting from the expanded use of higher value genetically modified seed 
on march   the company acquired the trace chemicals business from bayer cropscience lp 
trace chemicals is a leader in farmer applied seed treatments in markets serving the united states 
the acquisition will serve to enhance the company s offerings in the crop protection business 
the cash paid for this acquisition was million and the assets acquired included inventory  property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
the crop protection business works closely with our customers  both distributors and individual growers  as part of an on the ground coordinated effort 
we develop products in response to ongoing customer demands  drawing upon existing technologies and tailoring them to match immediate needs 
for example  a grower s crops may require varying levels of treatment depending on weather conditions and the degree of infestation 
our research and technology is therefore geared towards responding to threats to crops around the world as they emerge under a variety of conditions 
our crop protection business benefits from nearly years of experience in the field  along with product registrations in more than countries 
our experience with registering products is a valuable asset  as registration is a significant barrier to entry  particularly in developed countries 
registration of products is a complex process in which we have developed proficiency over time 
the breadth of our distribution network and the depth of our experience enable us to focus on profitable market niches that are less sensitive to competitive pricing pressures than broad commodity segments of the market 
the crop protection business sells its products in north america through a distribution network consisting of more than distributors and by selling directly to end use customers 
internationally  the crop protection businesses direct sales force services over  distributors  dealers  cooperatives  seed companies and large growers 
part of our expertise in bromine based material is the production and distribution of methyl bromide  a fumigant used to improve crop yields  and protect grain in storage from pest infestation 
such materials are regularly used to treat food processing plants  breweries  warehouses and grain elevators  as well as rail cars  truck trailers and intermodal containers 
while the use of methyl bromide has been restricted by regulations  it continues to play an important role in protecting the food chain 
where safe and effective alternatives are not available  our products continue to be employed at cargo ports where agricultural commodities need to be treated quickly and comprehensively to prevent transmission of infestation across international borders and as a preplant treatment to control weeds  diseases  insects and nematodes in high value food crops leading to increased yields and higher fresh produce quality 
net sales of crop protection during  and were  and of the company s total net sales  respectively 
consumer products the consumer products reporting segment includes two principal product lines pool and spa and household cleaners  which were acquired from great lakes as a result of the merger 
net sales of the consumer products business in were million and million in  representing six months of ownership following the merger 
our pool and spa product line produces and distributes sanitizers  algicides  biocides  oxidizers  ph balancers  mineral balancers and other specialty chemicals and accessories 
our primary channels of distribution are pool and spa dealers  wholesale distributors  and mass market retailers 
we believe that we hold the leading position in the north american pool and spa chemical business and we plan to strengthen our position by expanding our dealer channels and our presence with leading mass market retailers 
through great lakes acquisition of lime o sol and a m cleaning products in  the consumer products business entered the specialty and multi purpose cleaners business with the works brand of non abrasive bathroom cleaners  glass and surface cleaners  toilet bowl cleaners  drain openers and rust and calcium removers  as well as the greased lightning family of multipurpose cleaners 
our primary channels of distribution are to major national retailers in the do it yourself  hardware  mass market  club and discount sectors 
net sales of consumer products during and were and of the company s total net sales  respectively 
other the other reporting segment  with net sales for  and of million  million and million  respectively  consists of four operating segments optical monomers  industrial water additives  and fluorine chemicals  which were acquired from great lakes as a result of the merger  and polymer processing equipment 
optical monomers produces specialized monomers used in eyewear and for such applications as protection sheets for welding masks  safety shields  photographic filters and lab equipment 
industrial water additives are used in the desalination processes and include antiscalents  corrosion inhibitors  dispersants  antifoams and superior bromine based non oxidizing and oxidizing microbiological control products 
the iwa business was divested in the second quarter of the company continues to manufacture and sell these products to the purchaser of this business under supply agreements 
fluorine chemicals are essential to the performance of silicone based materials under demanding conditions where aggressive solvents or high temperatures may be present 
other fluorine chemicals are used as propellants in medical inhalers and as refrigerants 
fluorine fire suppression systems offer waterless solutions for mission critical and high value assets  preventing extensive fire damage and eliminating collateral damage and downtime 
in august  the company received notification that a significant customer of the fluorine business was not going to renew their contract after december  as a result of the projected loss of this customer s revenue from future cash flow projections  the company reviewed the recoverability of the long lived assets and goodwill of the fluorine business 
based on this review the company recorded impairment charges of million related to goodwill and million related to other long lived assets  principally intangibles and property  plant and equipment 
polymer processing equipment business was a global leader in the manufacture of integrated polymer processing equipment 
effective in april  the company contributed its polymer processing equipment business to hamilton robinson  llc to form a venture that was accounted for as an equity investment 
on october   the company sold its majority interest in the davis standard llc venture to hamilton robinson llc  for approximately million in cash  plus an additional million that is payable upon finalizing certain post closing determinations 
sources of raw materials hydrocarbon based and inorganic chemicals constitute most of the raw materials required to manufacture our products 
these materials are generally available from a number of sources  some of which are foreign 
we use significant amounts of ethylene  propylene  benzene  chlorine  caustic  tin  soybean oil  and tallow in many of our chemical manufacturing processes 
large increases in the cost of such key raw materials  as well as natural gas which powers some key production facilities  particularly for sustained periods of time  could adversely affect our operating margins if we are not able to pass the higher costs on to our customers through higher selling prices 
while temporary shortages of raw materials we use may occur occasionally  key raw materials are generally available 
however  their continuing availability and price are subject to domestic and world market and political conditions and regulations 
major requirements for key raw materials are typically purchased pursuant to multi year contracts 
we are not dependent on any one supplier for a significant amount of our raw material requirements  except for one hydrocarbon supplier which provides us with approximately to of our requirements for diverse raw materials sourced from the supplier s multiple manufacturing and processing locations 
however  we have alternative sources of supply for substantially all of the raw materials sourced from this hydrocarbon supplier 
we hold a unconsolidated interest in rubicon inc rubicon  a manufacturing joint venture with huntsman corporation  located in geismar  louisiana  which supplies both huntsman and us with aniline  and us with diphenylamine dpa 
we believe that our aniline and dpa needs in the foreseeable future will be met by production from rubicon 
seasonal business with the exception of the crop protection business and the pool and spa product line in our consumer products segment  no material portion of any segment of our business is significantly seasonal 
our crop business is seasonal in nature and corresponds to agricultural cycles 
sales are weakest in the fourth quarter 
in  the company expects that some sales that in prior years would have been booked in the first quarter will instead occur in the second and third quarters owing to changing buying patterns in the industry 
similarly  the largest portion of our pool chemicals business serves the us recreational water market and generally accelerates in the first half of any calendar year and declines thereafter 
customers no one customer s business accounts for more than ten percent of our consolidated net sales 
competitive conditions we produce a broad range of products for a wide variety of end use markets  including automotive  transportation  construction  packaging  agriculture  lubricants  plastics for durable and non durable goods  including electronics  industrial rubber  and pool  spa and home care products 
the breadth of our product offering provides multiple channels for growth and lessens our dependence on any one market 
we sell our products in more than countries  and this worldwide presence further reduces our exposure to any one country s or region s economy 
we have a broad client base and believe that our products  many of which we customize for the specific needs of our customers  allow us to enhance customer loyalty and attract customers that value product innovation and reliable supply 
product performance  quality  technical and customer service  and price are all important factors in competing in substantially all of our businesses 
we face significant competition in many of the markets in which we operate as a result of the trends toward global expansion and consolidation by competitors 
some of our existing competitors are larger than we are and may have more resources and better access to capital markets for continued expansion or new product development than we do 
some of our competitors also have a greater product range or better distribution capability than we do for specific products or geographical areas 
research and development our research and development expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in higher spending in was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of activity from the great lakes businesses as compared with only six months of spending included in research and development works with each business within the company to help bring safe and effective new products to market in a timely manner while also maintaining existing product registrations required by regulatory agencies around the world 
intellectual property and licenses we have approximately  united states and foreign patents and pending applications and have trademark protection for approximately  product names 
patents  trade names  trademarks  know how  trade secrets  formulae  and manufacturing techniques assist in maintaining the competitive position of certain of our products 
patents  formulae  and know how are of particular importance in the manufacture of a number of specialty chemicals manufactured and sold by us 
we are licensed to use certain patents and technologies owned by other companies  including some foreign companies  to manufacture products complementary to our own products  for which we pay royalties in amounts not considered material to our consolidated financial results 
products to which we have such rights include certain crop protection chemicals 
environmental matters chemical companies are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions to the air  discharges to land  surface  subsurface strata and water and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste and other materials 
chemical companies are also subject to other federal  state and local laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters 
environmental health and safety regulation 
we believe that our business  operations and facilities have been and are being operated in substantial compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations  many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations 
the ongoing operations of chemical manufacturing plants  however  entail risks in these areas and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred 
in addition  future developments  such as increasingly strict requirements of environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and enforcement policies thereunder  could bring into question the handling  manufacture  use  emission or disposal of substances or pollutants at facilities owned  used or controlled by us or our manufacture  use or disposal of certain products or wastes and could involve potentially significant expenditures 
to meet changing permitting and regulatory standards  we may be required to make significant site or operational modifications  potentially involving substantial expenditures and reduction or suspension of certain operations 
we incurred million of costs for capital projects and million for operating and maintenance costs related to environmental health and safety programs at our facilities during in  we expect to incur approximately million of costs for capital projects and million for operating and maintenance costs related to environmental health and safety programs at our facilities 
during  we paid million to clean up previously utilized waste disposal sites and to remediate current and past facilities 
we expect to spend approximately million during to clean up such waste disposal sites and to remediate current and former facilities 
pesticide regulation 
our crop protection business is subject to regulation under various federal  state  and foreign laws and regulations relating to the manufacture  sale and use of pesticide products 
in august  congress enacted the food quality protection act of fqpa  which made significant changes to the federal insecticide  fungicide  and rodenticide act fifra  governing us sale and use of pesticide products  and the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act ffdca  which limits pesticide residues on food 
fqpa facilitated registrations and re registrations of pesticides for special so called minor uses under fifra and authorized collection of maintenance fees to support pesticide re registrations 
coordination of regulations implementing fifra and ffdca is now required 
food safety provisions of fqpa establish a single standard of safety for pesticide residue on raw and processed foods  require that information be provided through large food retail stores to consumers about the health risks of pesticide residues and how to avoid them  preempt state and local food safety laws if they are based on concentrations of pesticide residues below recently established federal residue limits called tolerances  and ensure that tolerances protect the health of infants and children 
ffdca  as amended by fqpa  authorizes the environmental protection agency epa to set a tolerance for a pesticide in or on food at a level which poses a reasonable certainty of no harm to consumers 
the epa is required to review all tolerances for all pesticide products 
some of our products have successfully completed review  others are currently under review and other products will be reviewed under this standard in the future 
the european commission ec has established procedures whereby all existing active ingredient pesticides will be reviewed 
this ec regulation became effective in and will result in a review of all commercial products 
the initial round of reviews covered ninety products  four of which are our products 
evaluation was successful for three of the products  support for the fourth product was withdrawn by the company for commercial reasons 
the remainder of our products will be reviewed in future years with the process expected to be completed by the end of the process may lead to full registration in member states of the ec or may lead to some restrictions or cancellation of registrations if it is determined that a product poses an unacceptable risk 
in december  the european union signed the registration  evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach legislation 
this legislation will require chemical manufacturers and importers in the european union to prove the safety of their products 
the effective date of the legislation is june  and it will require all covered substances to be pre registered within months of the effective date 
there are other provisions of the legislation that phase in over a year period 
the company does not anticipate any impact to its financial position or results of operations in  however  the impact of this legislation in and beyond is unknown at this time 
it is possible that reach may affect our ability to sell and manufacture some products 
geographic information the information with respect to sales and property  plant and equipment attributable to each of our major geographic areas served for each of our last three fiscal years is set forth in note business segment data in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consider that the risks relating to operations of our foreign subsidiaries are comparable to those of other us companies which operate subsidiaries in developed countries 
these risks include risks of political change  change in tax regulations  change in business climate  economic changes and foreign currency volatility

item a 
risk factors the factors described below represent the principal risks that could materially adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
except as otherwise indicated  these factors may or may not occur and we cannot predict the likelihood of any such factor occurring 
other risk factors may exist that we do not consider significant based on information that is currently available 
in addition  new risks may emerge at any time  and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our financial performance 
a decline in general economic conditions and other external factors may adversely impact our results of operations 
external factors  including general economic conditions  international events and circumstances  competitor actions and governmental regulation are beyond our control and can cause fluctuations in demand and volatility in the price of raw materials and other costs that can intensify the impact of economic cycles on our operations 
we produce a broad range of products that are used as additives and components in other products in a wide variety of end use markets 
as a result  our products may be negatively impacted by supply and demand instability in other industries and the effects of that instability on supply chain participants 
economic and political conditions in countries in which we operate may also adversely impact our operations 
these same risks may also impact the financial markets and may negatively affect our access to capital 
while these external factors may adversely affect our businesses  we believe that the breadth of our product offering lessens our dependence on any one market and that our worldwide presence further reduces our exposure to economic conditions or political instability in any one country or region 
significant competition may force us to reduce prices  which may adversely impact our results of operations 
we face significant competition in many of the markets in which we operate as a result of the trend toward global expansion and consolidation by competitors 
some of our existing competitors are larger than we are and may have more resources and better access to capital markets to facilitate continued expansion or new product development 
some of our competitors also have greater product range or better distribution capability than we do for specific products or geographic regions 
price competition also exists in some of the markets in which we participate where customers are sensitive to changes in price 
additionally  other factors such as industry overcapacity and lower cost structures have the effect of putting downward pressure on prices 
we expect that we will continue to face new competitive challenges as well as additional risks inherent in international operations in developing regions 
we also expect to face increased competition from the further use and introduction of generic and alternative products by our competitors 
this increased competition could cause us to reduce our prices and take other steps to compete effectively  which could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  even if we were to raise prices  the reactions of our competitors and customers to such price increases could cause us to reevaluate and possibly reverse such price increases or risk a loss in sales volumes 
the cyclicality of the chemicals industry may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results and cash flows 
our historical operating results reflect the cyclical and volatile nature of the supply and demand balance of the chemicals industry 
the chemicals industry has experienced alternating periods of inadequate capacity and tight supply  allowing prices and profit margins to increase  followed by periods when substantial capacity is added  resulting in oversupply  over capacity and corresponding declining utilization rates  causing declining prices and profit margins 
the cyclicality of the markets in which we operate may result in volatile operating results and cash flow over the business cycle 
future growth in product demand may not be sufficient to utilize current or future capacity 
excess industry capacity may continue to depress our volumes and margins on some products 
as a result of excess industry capacity  rising energy costs and rising raw materials costs  operating results may be volatile 
any disruption in the availability or price of the raw materials or energy utilized for our products may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we purchase large amounts of raw materials and energy for our businesses 
the costs of these materials and energy  in the aggregate  represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses 
the prices and availability of the raw materials used by us vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile 
over the past few years  we have experienced significant cost increases in purchases of petrochemicals  tin  soybean oil  other raw materials and our primary energy source  natural gas 
while we may attempt to match raw material or energy price increases with corresponding product price increases  we may not be able to immediately raise product prices  if at all 
ultimately  our ability to pass on increases in the cost of raw materials or energy to customers is greatly dependent upon market conditions and raising prices could result in a loss of sales volume 
there have been in the past  and will likely be in the future  periods of time during which we are unable to pass raw material and energy price increases on to our customers  in whole or in part 
reactions by our customers and competitors to our price increases could cause us to reevaluate and possibly reverse such price increases  which may increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results 
the results of our crop protection business are dependent on weather  disease  and pest conditions and can be affected by local and regional economic circumstances 
the results of our consumer products business are also dependent on weather conditions 
adverse weather or economic conditions could materially affect our results of operations 
sales volumes for our crop protection business  as with all agricultural products  are subject to the sector s dependency on weather  disease  and pest infestation conditions 
adverse conditions in a particular region could materially adversely affect our crop protection business 
demand for crop protection products is also influenced by the agricultural policies of governments and regulatory authorities particularly in developing countries in regions where we do business  such as in asia and latin america 
changes in governmental policies or product registration requirements could have an adverse impact on our ability to market and sell our products 
also  crop protection products typically are sold pursuant to contracts with extended payment terms in latin america and europe 
customary  extended payment periods  which are tied to particular crop growing cycles  make our crop protection business susceptible to losses from receivables during economic downturns and may adversely affect our operating results and our cash flows 
our pool and spa products in the consumer products business are primarily used in swimming pools and hot tubs 
demand for these products is influenced by a variety of factors including seasonal weather patterns 
an adverse change in weather patterns during pool season could adversely affect the demand for and profitability of our pool and spa products 
current and future litigation  governmental investigations and administrative claims  including antitrust related governmental investigations and lawsuits  could harm our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are currently involved in a number of governmental investigations and administrative claims  including antitrust related governmental investigations and civil lawsuits 
that number could increase in the future 
further  we have incurred and could incur significant additional expense in the future in connection with antitrust related matters  including expenses related to our cooperation with governmental authorities and defense related civil lawsuits 
we are also involved in several significant lawsuits and claims relating to environmental matters 
in addition  we are routinely subject to other civil claims  litigation and arbitration  and regulatory investigations  arising in the ordinary course of our present businesses as well as with respect to our divested businesses 
some of these claims and lawsuits relate to product liability claims  including claims related to current products and asbestos related claims concerning the premises and historic products of our corporate affiliates and predecessors 
we also could become subject to additional claims in the future 
an adverse outcome of one or more of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or cash flows 
environmental  health and safety regulation matters could have a substantial negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign environmental  safety and health laws  and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions in the air  discharges to land and water  and the generation  handling  treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials 
our operations entail the risk of violations of those laws and sanctions for violations  such as clean up costs  costs of waste disposal  and payments for property damage and personal injury 
although it is our policy to comply with such laws and regulations  it is possible that we have not been or may not be at all times in compliance with all of these requirements 
in addition  these requirements  and enforcement of these requirements  may become more stringent in the future 
the ultimate cost of compliance with any such requirements could be material 
non compliance could subject us to material liabilities  such as government fines or orders  third party lawsuits  remediations  and settlements  or the suspension of non compliant operations 
we may also be required to make significant site or operational modifications at substantial cost 
future regulatory or other developments could also restrict or eliminate the use of or require us to make modifications to our products  packaging  manufacturing processes and technology  which could have a significant adverse impact on our cash flow and results of operations 
at any given time  we are involved in claims  litigation  administrative proceedings  settlements  and investigations of various types in a number of jurisdictions involving potential environmental liabilities  including clean up costs associated with hazardous waste disposal sites  natural resource damages  property damage  personal injury  and regulatory compliance or noncompliance 
the resolution of these environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flow 
we are an international company and are exposed to risks in the countries in which we have significant operations or interests 
changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements  export controls or international tax treaties could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are dependent  in large part  on the economies of the countries in which we manufacture and market our products 
of our net sales  were to customers in the us and canada  to europe and africa  to asia pacific and to latin america 
our net property  plant and equipment at december  was located in the us and canada  in europe and africa  in asia pacific and in latin america 
the economies of countries in these areas are in different stages of socioeconomic development 
consequently  we are exposed to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  inflation  governmental spending  social instability and other political  economic or social developments that may materially affect  positively or negatively  our results of operations or cash flows 
we may also face difficulties managing and administering an internationally dispersed business 
in particular  the management of our personnel across several countries can present logistical and managerial challenges 
additionally  international operations present challenges related to operating under different business cultures and languages  we may have to comply with unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements which could negatively impact our operations and ability to manage our global financial resources  export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products into and from some markets  we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and other intellectual property overseas due to uncertainty of laws and enforcement in a number of countries relating to the protection of intellectual property rights  and changes in tax regulation and international tax treaties could significantly reduce the financial performance of our foreign operations or the magnitude of their contributions to our overall financial performance 
the inability to register our products in member states of the european union  under the reach legislation  may lead to some restrictions or cancellation of registrations  which could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain products 
in december  the european union signed the registration  evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach legislation 
this legislation will require chemical manufacturers and importers in the european union to prove the safety of their products 
the effective date of the legislation is june  and it will require all covered substances to be pre registered within months of the effective date 
there are other provisions of the legislation that phase in over a year period 
the company does not anticipate any impact to its financial position or results of operations in  however  the impact of this legislation in and beyond is unknown at this time 
it is possible that reach may affect our ability to sell and manufacture some products 
our results of operations are subject to exchange rate and other currency risks 
a significant movement in exchange rates could adversely impact our results of operations 
significant portions of our businesses are conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
this means that foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results 
the following table shows the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our pre tax loss from continuing operations and net sales for  and year ended december in millions pre tax loss from continuing operations impact of favorable unfavorable foreign currency translation on pre tax earnings loss from continuing operations net sales impact of favorable foreign currency translation on net sales effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results cannot be predicted because of the number of currencies involved  the variability of currency exposures  and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates 
we will face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations 
exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls 
currency devaluations result in diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting a devaluation 
actions of this nature could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 
we have unfunded and underfunded pension plans and post retirement health care plans  which if changes to the funded status occur could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows 
we have unfunded obligations under our domestic tax qualified defined benefit pension plans  totaling approximately million on a projected benefit obligation basis as of december  a significant decline in the value of the plan investments in the future or unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that govern pension plan funding could materially change the timing and amount of required pension funding 
we also sponsor foreign and non qualified pension plans under which there are substantial unfunded liabilities  totaling approximately million on a projected benefit obligation basis as of december  in addition  we sponsor post retirement health care plans under which there are substantial unfunded liabilities  totaling approximately million on a projected benefit obligation basis as of december  mandatory funding contributions with respect to our tax qualified pension plans and potential unfunded benefit liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
changes in our sales strategy may impact our results of operations and our ability to service our customers 
we recently began to utilize third party distributors for sales and service to some customers that purchase small annual quantities of our products 
we believe that this action will lower our costs associated with serving smaller customers  thus enhancing profitability and reducing our investment in inventory 
however  it is possible that changing our sales strategy with respect to these customers could result in the loss of volume to some customers or some disruption in selling and in inventory management during the transition 
we are dependent upon a trained  dedicated sales force  the loss of which could materially affect our operations 
many of our products are sold and supported through dedicated staff and specifically trained personnel 
the loss of this sales force due to market or other conditions could affect our ability to sell and support our products effectively  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
production facilities are subject to operating risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
we are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities 
such production facilities are subject to hazards associated with the manufacturing  handling  storage  and transportation of chemical materials and products  including pipeline leaks and ruptures  explosions  fires  inclement weather and natural disasters  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  labor difficulties  transportation interruptions  remediation complications  chemical spills  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous gases  storage tank leaks  and other environmental risks 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to  or destruction of  property and equipment and environmental damage  fines  and liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our business depends upon many proprietary technologies  including patents and licenses 
our competitive position could be adversely affected if we fail to protect our patents or other intellectual property rights  or if we become subject to claims that we are infringing upon the rights of others 
we have over  united states and foreign patents and pending applications and have trademark protection for approximately  product names 
patents  trademarks  trade secrets in the nature of know how  formulations  and manufacturing techniques assist us in maintaining the competitive position of certain of our products 
our intellectual property is of particular importance to a number of specialty chemicals we manufacture and sell 
we are licensed to use certain patents and technology owned by other companies  including some foreign companies  to manufacture products complementary to our own products  for which we pay royalties in amounts not considered material  in the aggregate  to our consolidated results 
our trademarks or the patents we own or license may be challenged  and as a result of such challenges we could lose our exclusive rights to our proprietary technologies  which would adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
while it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to restrict the use and disclosure of our trade secrets and proprietary know how  those confidentiality agreements may be breached 
in addition  adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know how  and others could obtain knowledge of such trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means 
the failure of our patents  trademarks or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes  apparatuses  technology  trade secrets  or proprietary know how could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
our patents may not provide full protection against competing manufacturers outside of the united states  the european union countries  and certain other developed countries 
weaker protection may adversely impact our sales and results of operations 
in some of the countries in which we operate  such as china  the laws protecting patent holders are significantly weaker than in the united states  the european union  and certain other developed countries 
weaker protection may help competing manufacturers be or become more competitive in markets where  but for the weaker protection  they might not otherwise be able to introduce competing products for a number of years 
we therefore tend  in these regions  to rely more heavily upon trade secret and know how protection  as applicable  than we do patents 
in addition  for our crop protection products being sold in china  we rely on regulatory protection of intellectual property provided by regulatory agencies that may not provide us with complete protection against competitors 
an inability to remain technologically innovative and to offer improved products and services in a cost effective manner could adversely impact our operating results 
our operating results are influenced in part by our ability to introduce new products and services that offer distinct value to our customers 
for example  our crop protection business seeks to provide tailored products for our customers often unique problems  which requires an ongoing level of innovation 
in many of the markets where we sell our products  the products are subject to a traditional product life cycle 
we devote significant human and financial resources to develop new technologically advanced products and services and we may not be successful in our research and development efforts 
convergence of our information systems could have an adverse effect on our internal controls over financial reporting or our results of operations 
we continue to integrate the former great lakes enterprise wide information system and certain international systems into our existing sap system in order to standardize our data and create efficiencies in processing information 
the transition from these systems or the inability to transition to one standard system could adversely affect our business and operations and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results 
any discord with our venture partners could potentially adversely affect the business and operations of the ventures and in turn the business and operations of the company 
a portion of our operations is conducted through certain ventures 
we share control of these ventures with third parties and in the event that our venture partners do not observe their venture obligations  it is possible that the affected venture would not be able to operate in accordance with its business plans or that we would have to increase our level of commitment to the venture to give effect to those plans 
by making these arrangements with third parties we run the risk of encountering differences of opinion or having difficulty reaching consensus with respect to certain business issues 
an inability to execute our portfolio divestiture plan could adversely affect our financial condition 
the assessment of the current businesses in our portfolio continues to be a multi year task and we are in discussions regarding potential transactions 
announcements will be made as agreements become firm 
while we estimate the potential proceeds from these divestitures could be significant  there can be no assurance that any of these transactions can be successfully completed or that we will realize the proceeds or cost savings we anticipate receiving

item legal proceedings the corporation is involved in claims  litigation  administrative proceedings and investigations of various types in a number of jurisdictions 
a number of such matters involve  or may involve  claims for a material amount of damages and relate to or allege environmental liabilities  including clean up costs associated with hazardous waste disposal sites  natural resource damages  property damage and personal injury 
environmental liabilities each quarter  the company evaluates and reviews estimates for future remediation and other costs to determine appropriate environmental reserve amounts 
for each site where the cost of remediation is probable and estimable  a determination is made of the specific measures that are believed to be required to remediate the site  the estimated total cost to carry out the remediation plan  the portion of the total remediation costs to be borne by the company and the anticipated time frame over which payments toward the remediation plan will occur 
at sites where the company expects to incur ongoing operations and maintenance expenditures  the company accrues on an undiscounted basis for a period  which is generally years  where it believes that such costs are estimable 
the total amount accrued for such environmental liabilities at december   was million 
the company estimates the reasonably possible and estimable environmental liability to range from million to million at december  the company s reserves include estimates for determinable clean up costs 
during  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million to increase its environmental liabilities and made payments of million for clean up costs  which reduced its environmental liabilities 
at a number of these sites  the extent of contamination has not yet been fully investigated or the final scope of remediation is not yet determinable 
the company intends to assert all meritorious legal defenses and will pursue other equitable factors that are available with respect to these matters 
however  the final cost of clean up at these sites could exceed the company s present estimates  and could have  individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
it is reasonably possible that the company s estimates for environmental remediation liabilities may change in the future should additional sites be identified  further remediation measures be required or undertaken  current laws and regulations be modified or additional environmental laws and regulations be enacted 
the company and some of its subsidiaries have been identified by federal  state or local governmental agencies  and by other potentially responsible parties a prp under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  or comparable state statutes  as a prp with respect to costs associated with waste disposal sites at various locations in the united states 
because these regulations have been construed to authorize joint and several liability  the epa could seek to recover all costs involving a waste disposal site from any one of the prp s for such site  including the company  despite the involvement of other prp s 
in many cases  the company is one of several hundred prp s so identified 
in a few instances  the company is one of only a handful of prp s  and at one site  the company is the only prp performing investigation and remediation 
where other financially responsible prp s are involved  the company expects that any ultimate liability resulting from such matters will be apportioned between the company and such other parties 
in addition  the company is involved with environmental remediation and compliance activities at some of its current and former sites in the united states and abroad 
the more significant of these matters are described below 
vertac uniroyal chemical company  inc uniroyal a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and its canadian subsidiary  uniroyal chemical co

the parties are currently completing the discovery phase of the cases and  in the first case described above  are preparing for a hearing on claim construction scheduled for the first quarter of osca great lakes previously held interests in osca  inc  which interests were divested to bj services company in may osca is a party to certain pending litigation regarding a blowout of a well in the gulf of mexico operated by newfield exploration company 
in the lawsuit  the plaintiffs claimed that osca and the other defendants breached their contracts to perform work over operations on the well and were negligent in performing those operations 
pursuant to an indemnification agreement between great lakes and bj services entered into at the time of the sale of osca  great lakes agreed to remain responsible for of any uninsured liability and costs in excess of million incurred by osca upon settlement or final determination of this pending litigation 
in april  a jury found osca and the other defendants responsible for those claims and determined osca s share of the damages 
in connection with the lawsuit  osca asserted claims against its insurers and insurance brokers in support of insurance coverage for this incident 
following a related trial on these insurance coverage claims  the court issued its final judgments on the underlying liability claims and the insurance coverage claims  entering judgment against osca for a net amount of approximately million plus interest and finding that such amount was not covered by insurance 
the company and bj services appealed certain of the liability and insurance coverage decisions 
in april  the united states fifth circuit court of appeals affirmed the jury s verdict on liability against osca  but reversed in part the district court s decision regarding insurance coverage available to osca and remanded the matter to the district court 
the district court will now determine what portion of the judgment against osca is covered by insurance after applying a policy exclusion that the fifth circuit found to be valid and applicable 
each quarter the company evaluates and reviews pending claims and litigation to determine appropriate reserve amounts 
as of december   the company s accrual for probable loss in the aforementioned legal proceeding cases is immaterial 
in addition  the related receivable to reflect probable insurance recoveries is also immaterial 
the company intends to assert all meritorious legal defenses and will pursue other equitable factors that are available with respect to these matters 
the resolution of the legal proceedings now pending or hereafter asserted against the company or any of its subsidiaries could require the company to pay costs or damages in excess of its present estimates  and as a result could  either individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition to the matters referred to above  the company is subject to routine litigation in connection with the ordinary course of its business 
these routine matters have not had a material adverse effect on the company  its business or financial condition in the past  and the company does not expect this litigation  individually or in the aggregate  to have a material adverse effect on its business or its financial condition in the future  but it can give no assurance that such will be the case

the company is headquartered in middlebury  connecticut  and operates in a wide variety of end use markets  including automotive  transportation  construction  packaging  agriculture  lubricants  plastics for durable and non durable goods including electronics  industrial rubber and home pool and spa chemicals 
most of our chemical products are sold to industrial manufacturing customers for use as additives  ingredients  or intermediates that add value to their end products 
our pool and spa chemicals are sold to dealers  distributors and major retailers 
we are a market leader in many of our key product lines 
we manufacture and sell more than  products and formulations in more than countries 
the primary economic factors that influence the company s operations and sales are industrial production  residential and commercial construction  auto production and resin production 
in addition  the company s crop protection segment is influenced by worldwide weather  disease and pest infestation conditions 
the company s consumer products segment is also influenced by general economic conditions impacting consumer spending and weather conditions 
other major factors affecting the company s financial performance include industry capacity  customer demand  raw material and energy costs and selling prices 
selling prices are influenced by global demand and supply factors 
the company s strategy is to pursue selling prices that reflect the value of our products and to pass on higher costs for raw material and energy so as to preserve our profit margins 
our target is to achieve a average operating profit margin across our business portfolio 
annual sales for increased million or  of which million was the result of acquisitions  primarily from the merger 
the company was successful in increasing selling prices most notably in its petroleum additives and flame retardants product lines but was required to offer price concessions to regain market share in the non flame plastic additives business ending the year with a net increase related to prices of million 
this was more than offset by a million reduction in sales volume primarily in the rubber chemicals  consumer products and epdm product lines these volume reductions were primarily due to aggressive competition from china  a slow down in the lubricant market  market erosion due to technological change and less than expected sales from new product launches and target customers 
the non flame retardant plastic additives product line  included within the plastic additives segment  showed volume improvement in compared with the the same period in however  volumes did not improve to the level expected due to market share losses  which resulted from the selling price increases implemented in as noted above  price concessions were required to regain market share 
although the company saw a return in volume  the products sold as compared to the prior year had lower overall gross profit margins  which negatively impacted operating profit 
the company will continue to focus on rebuilding the profitability of these products during profits for the flame retardant plastic additives product line  included within the plastic additives segment  improved significantly during  as increases in selling prices more than offset declines in volume 
flame retardant products continue to benefit from selling price increases that the company implemented to recover cost increases experienced in the prior year 
volume declines were primarily the result of a decrease in the domestic polyurethane foam market 
the flame retardant product line also benefited from million of savings derived from manufacturing cost initiatives 
the polymers segment was less profitable compared with the prior year  primarily due to weak demand in the roofing and automotive markets 
selling price increases were insufficient to offset lower plant utilization and higher raw material and energy costs 
sales from the specialty additives segment were one percent lower compared with the prior year 
the rubber chemicals business saw a drop in volume resulting from thiazole and sulfenamides volumes losses due to aggressive competition from china and flexzone volume losses due to price erosion and increased competition 
the company s petroleum additive products experienced continued improvement in selling prices as compared with the prior year  which more than offset volume losses that were the result of a decrease in demand related to slower automotive production 
crop protection sales were up compared with the prior year 
volume decreased in from due primarily to competition in the miticides business and drought conditions in australia 
sales were also unfavorably impacted by price erosion due to economic weakness in brazil  the influx of generic products and increased competition 
the lower volumes and selling prices were offset by the acquisition of trace chemicals in the first half of and a full year of the fumigants business as a result of the merger 
sales for consumer products increased million from the prior year  of which million was the result of acquisitions  primarily from the merger 
the company was able to implement selling price increases at several of its significant customers but this was more than offset by volume losses due to less than expected sales from new product launches and existing target customers 
the company has undertaken various cost reduction initiatives over the past several years and continues to aggressively pursue cost reductions

although plastic additives showed significant improvement in operating profit versus  sales volumes declined in the second half of primarily due to customer reaction to price increases and a related loss of market share in certain product lines 
the company believed these sales volumes reached their lowest point in the fourth quarter 
the decline was primarily in the non flame retardant business 
the company believes it underestimated customer and competitive reactions to its pricing initiatives and it did not expect competitors to so aggressively pursue sales volume 
as a result of the sales volume decline experienced during the second half of  the company has refined its pricing tactics to use customer and product profitability analysis to more selectively implement pricing changes based on customer and product level dynamics  rather than utilize more broadly based pricing tactics 
the company expects these actions will prevent a further loss in market share and result in replacement or recovery of a portion of the sales volumes lost during the second half of polymers polymers sales of million were up from due primarily to improved pricing of and favorable foreign currency translation of  partially offset by a decrease of from lower unit volume

critical accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
accounting estimates and assumptions in this section are those the company considers to be the most critical to understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
for all of these estimates  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following paragraphs summarize the company s critical accounting estimates 
significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill the company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its long lived assets  excluding goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
under such circumstances  the company assesses whether the projected undiscounted cash flows of its businesses are sufficient to recover the existing unamortized cost of its long lived assets 
if the undiscounted projected cash flows are not sufficient  the company calculates the impairment amount by discounting the projected cash flows using its weighted average cost of capital 
the amount of the impairment is written off against earnings in the period in which the impairment has been determined in accordance with statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company tests the recoverability of goodwill of each of its reporting units on an annual basis as of july  or sooner if events occur or circumstances change  by comparing the net book value to the estimated fair value of each of its reporting units to determine if there is a potential impairment issue 
the fair value is estimated based on discounted projected cash flows 
in estimating the discounted projected cash flows  the company utilizes estimated long term revenue and cash flow forecasts developed as part of its planning process  as well as assumptions of terminal value  together with its weighted average cost of capital  to determine fair value 
if the fair value is not sufficient to cover the carrying value of the reporting unit  the company calculates the goodwill impairment amount related to that reporting unit in accordance with statement  goodwill and other intangible assets 
any impairment is charged against earnings in the period in which the amount has been determined 
the company s cash flow projections used to estimate the fair value of its reporting units are based on subjective estimates  the most significant of which are selling prices and their relationship to raw material costs  sales volumes and cost reduction or savings benefits 
deviations of actual results from the company s estimates  as well as a change in the discount rate utilized  could impact the fair value estimates used to determine whether an impairment exists 
based on the fair value estimates used in july to test goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement  the company concluded that an impairment of million existed for its fluorine business at july  the company concluded that no impairment existed in any of its other reporting units at july  although the company believes that its projections reflect its best estimates of the future performance of its reporting units  changes in estimates of sales volume  selling prices  raw material costs  and cost reduction or savings benefits used to project the cash flows for its reporting units could have an impact on the fair value used to test goodwill of the reporting unit for impairment 
any increases in the estimated future cash flows of its reporting units would have had no impact on the carrying value of that reporting unit 
however  a decrease in estimated future cash flows could require the company to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit among the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit for the purpose of determining whether a goodwill impairment exists 
the effect of cost saving initiatives  process improvements and new technology achievements are currently the most sensitive factors affecting the projected cash flows for the non flame retardant plastic additives reporting unit 
if  when conducting its annual goodwill impairment test as of july   the company assumed that the benefits of these initiatives were lower than forecasted  the carrying value of the reporting unit would have exceeded the fair value estimate by approximately million 
had the company assumed no benefit from these initiatives  the carrying value of the reporting unit would exceed the fair value estimate by approximately million 
in either case  the company would have been required to allocate the fair value among the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit for purposes of determining whether a goodwill impairment existed at july  additionally  the relationship of raw material price increases to selling price increases coupled with the company s ability to regain market share could cause actual results to differ significantly from the projected amounts 
the company has factored into their forecasts a terminal value which accounts for this sensitivity 
if the terminal value growth factor used in the non flame retardant plastic additives projections were assumed to be basis points lower  the carrying value of the reporting unit would have exceeded the fair value estimate by approximately million at july   and the company would have been required to determine whether recognition of a goodwill impairment charge was required 
as of july   the company did not factor in any improvements to future cash flow projections that might be made to the reporting unit as a result of acquisitions or expansion of product lines into target regions 
environmental matters the company is involved in claims  litigation  administrative proceedings and investigations of various types in a number of jurisdictions 
a number of such matters involve claims for a material amount of damages and relate to or allege environmental liabilities  including clean up costs associated with hazardous waste disposal sites  natural resource damages  property damage and personal injury 
the company and some of its subsidiaries have been identified by federal  state or local governmental agencies  and by other potentially responsible parties each a prp under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  or comparable state statutes  as a prp with respect to costs associated with waste disposal sites at various locations in the united states 
in addition  the company is involved with environmental remediation and compliance activities at some of its current and former sites in the united states and abroad 
each quarter  the company evaluates and reviews estimates for future remediation  and operation and management costs directly related to remediation  to determine appropriate environmental reserve amounts 
for each site where the cost of remediation is probable and estimable  a determination is made of the specific measures that are believed to be required to remediate the site  the estimated total cost to carry out the remediation plan  the portion of the total remediation costs to be borne by the company and the anticipated time frame over which payments toward the remediation plan will occur 
at sites where the company expects to incur ongoing operation and maintenance expenditures  the company accrues on an undiscounted basis for a period  which is generally years  where it believes that such costs are estimable 
as of december   the company s reserves for environmental remediation activities totaled million 
the company estimates the reasonably possible and estimable environmental liability to range from million to million at december  the company s reserves include estimates for determinable clean up costs 
at a number of these sites  the extent of contamination has not yet been fully investigated or the final scope of remediation is not yet determinable 
the company intends to assert all meritorious legal defenses and will pursue other equitable factors that are available with respect to these matters 
however  the final cost of clean up at these sites could exceed the company s present estimates  and could have  individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  it is possible that the company s estimates for environmental remediation liabilities may change in the future should additional sites be identified  further remediation measures be required or undertaken  current laws and regulations be modified or additional environmental laws and regulations be enacted 
the company intends to assert all meritorious legal defenses and will pursue other equitable factors that are available with respect to these matters 
the resolution of the environmental matters now pending or hereafter asserted against the company or any of its subsidiaries could require the company to pay remedial costs or damages  which are not currently determinable  could exceed the company s present estimates  and as a result could have  either individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
pension and other post retirement benefits expense the company s calculation of pension and other post retirement benefits expense is dependent on a number of assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  expected long term rates of return on plan assets  mortality rates  expected salary and wage increases  and other factors 
components of pension and other post retirement benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other post retirement benefit plans  expected return on plan assets and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations 
actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and other post retirement benefits costs and obligations 
pension plans pension liabilities are measured on a discounted basis and the assumed discount rate is a significant assumption 
at each measurement date  the discount rate is based on interest rates for high quality  long term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to our liabilities 
at november   the company utilized a weighted average discount rate of percent for domestic pension plans  which was basis points lower than the rate used at november   for the international and non qualified plans  a weighted average discount rate of percent was used at november   basis points lower than the weighted rate used at the same time last year 
as a sensitivity measure  a basis point reduction in the discount rate for all plans would result in approximately a million decrease in pre tax earnings for the domestic discount rate adopted at november  utilizes an interest rate yield curve to determine the discount rate pursuant to emerging issues task force eitf topic no 
d  selection of discount rates used for measuring defined benefit pension obligations and obligations of post retirement benefit plans other than pensions 
the yield curve is comprised of aaa aa bonds with maturities between zero and thirty years 
the company discounts the annual cash flows of its domestic pension plans using this yield curve and develops a single point discount rate matching the plan s payout structure 
a similar approach is used to determine the appropriate discount rates for the international plans 
the actual method used varies from country to country depending on the amount of available information on bond yields to be able to estimate a single point discount rate to match the plans benefit disbursements 
the company s weighted average estimated rate of compensation increase was percent for all domestic and international pension plans combined at november  as a sensitivity measure  an increase of basis points in the estimated rate of compensation increase would decrease pre tax earnings for by approximately million 
the expected return on pension plan assets is based on our investment strategy  historical experience  and our expectations for long term rates of return 
the company determines the expected rate of return on plan assets for the domestic and international pension plans by applying the expected returns on various asset classes to the company s target asset allocation 
the company utilized a weighted average expected long term rate of return of percent on all domestic plan assets and a weighted average rate of percent for the international plan assets at november  historical returns are evaluated based on an arithmetic average of annual returns derived from recognized passive indices  such as the s p  for the major asset classes 
the company looked at the arithmetic averages of annual investment returns from passive indices  assuming a portfolio of investments that follow the current target asset alloca tion for the domestic plans over several business cycles  to obtain an indication of the long term historical market performance 
the arithmetic average return over the past years was percent and over the past years was percent 
these values are not significantly higher than the geometric averages for the same periods and exceed the percent domestic expected return on assets 
the actual annualized return on plan assets for the domestic plans for the months ending november  was approximately percent  which exceeded the expected return on asset assumption for the year  resulting in a gain for the plans 
similarly  the international plans earned a weighted average return of approximately percent in local currency terms  before allowing for depreciation of the us dollar against major currencies in and percent in us dollar terms 
the company s target asset allocation for the domestic pension plans is based on investing of plan assets in equity instruments and of plan assets in fixed income investments including real estate 
at november   of the portfolio was invested in equities and the remainder in fixed income investments 
during  the company increased the duration of the fixed income portfolio for the domestic plans to approximately years  so that the overall duration of the assets better matches the duration of the plan liabilities 
the objective of this duration matching is to reduce the volatility of the funded status caused by fluctuations in interest rates  so when interest rates rise  any reduction in the value of the fixed income portfolio will be offset by a reduction in the value of the plan obligations 
similarly  when interest rates fall  any increase in the value of the plan obligations will be offset by an increase in value of the fixed income portfolio 
similarly the investment strategies for international plans give consideration to the different plan liabilities  market conditions and tolerance to risk 
the company has unrecognized actuarial losses relating to its pension plans which have been included in its consolidated balance sheet but not in the consolidated statements of operations 
the extent to which these unrecognized actuarial losses will impact future pre tax earnings depends on whether the unrecognized actuarial losses are deferred through the asset smoothing mechanism the market related value as defined by fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for pensions  or though amortization in pre tax earnings to the extent that they exceed a amortization corridor  as defined by fasb statement no 
 which provides for amortization over the average remaining participant career 
the amortization of unrecognized net losses existing as of november  will result in an million decrease to pre tax earnings for million for the qualified domestic plans and mi llion for the international and non qualified plans 
since future gains and losses beyond are a result of various factors described herein  it is not possible to predict with certainty to what extent the combination of current and future losses may exceed the percent amortization corridor and thereby be subject to further amortization 
the estimated required funding amounts for through discussed below are based on actual november  asset values and assume that the minimum legislated contributions will be made in the future 
the funding estimates also assume that interest rates will remain at or near current levels and no other significant changes will occur with regard to demographics  legislation  plan provisions or actuarial assumptions and methods used to determine the estimated funding requirements 
it is assumed that the expected return on assets  as discussed above  will be earned each year on invested assets 
based on these assumptions  there are no funding requirements for the qualified domestic pension plans for through for the international and non qualified pension plans the cash requirements for funding and the payment of unfunded benefits are estimated to be million in  million in  million in  million in and million in to the extent that current assumptions are not borne out  actual cash requirements may be significantly different from these estimates 
the above projections take into account the effect of the implementation of the pension protection act the ppa 
the ppa extends interest rate relief for qualified domestic pension plans until  at which time a new methodology for determining required funding amounts will be phased in 
these provisions have been taken into account in the above figures  which reflect the company s current understanding of the ppa requirements 
to the extent that further regulations are issued with respect to the ppa  the above amounts may change 
in the united kingdom  changes to legislation impacting funding requirements mean that it is not possible to estimate future contributions with any certainty at this time  as valuations under the new requirements have not yet been prepared 
however  for the purposes of the amounts estimated above  we have assumed that the funding requirements of the plans sponsored by the company in the united kingdom will target a to funding level over a period of years 
it is assumed that the funding level will be examined during and impacting the contribution requirements in and  taking into account contributions and investment returns to the date of examination 
discussions between the company and the trustees of these plans may lead to differing funding requirements than those given 
based on current assumptions  a basis point change in the actual return on assets would not impact the estimated future funding requirements for the qualified domestic pension plans for through the impact of a basis point increase or decrease in the actual return on assets on the estimated funding requirements for the international and non qualified plans would be zero in and  a million increase or decrease in and and a million increase or million decrease in pension income expense is calculated based upon certain assumptions including discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality rates and expected salary and wage increases 
actual results that differ from the current assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and will affect pension expense in future periods 
the following table estimates the future pension expense  based upon current assumptions pension income expense by period in millions qualified domestic pension plans international and non qualified pension plans total pension plans the following tables show the impact of a basis point change in the actual return on assets 
change in pension income expense by period increase decrease basis point increase in investment returns qualified domestic pension plans international and non qualified pension plans total pension plans increase decrease basis point decrease in investment returns qualified domestic pension plans international and non qualified pension plans total pension plans other post retirement benefits the company provides post retirement health and life insurance benefits for current retired and active employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents for certain domestic and international employee groups 
due to a change in legislation in the netherlands  the reserve for the arrangement offering post retirement medical benefits for retirees before age for dutch employees was no longer required at the end of the year 
the discount rates adopted by the company for the valuation of the post retirement health care plans were determined using the same methodology as for the pension plans 
an analysis of the duration of the liabilities and future cash flows showed that it was appropriate to use the same discount rates for the post retirement health care plans as were used for the domestic pension plans at november   namely percent for the domestic plans and a weighted average rate of percent for the international plans 
as a sensitivity measure  a basis point reduction in the discount rate would result in approximately a million decrease in pre tax earnings for assumed health care cost trend rates are based on past and current health care cost trends  considering such factors as health care inflation  changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns  technological advances  and the overall health of plan participants 
the company uses health care trend cost rates which vary by plan  starting with initial levels of percent for the domestic arrangements  grading down to an ultimate level of percent 
for the international arrangement  the weighted average initial rate is percent  grading down to percent 
the pre tax post retirement healthcare expense was million in the following table summarizes projected post retirement benefit expense based upon the various assumptions discussed above 
in millions pre tax expense by period domestic and international post retirement benefit plans income taxes income taxes payable reflects the company s current tax provision and management s best estimate of the tax liability relating to the outcome of current and future tax audits 
if the actual outcome of audits differs from the company s best estimates  an adjustment to income taxes payable could be required  which may result in additional income tax expense or benefit 
the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized 
the company also records deferred tax assets for the expected future tax benefits of net operating losses and income tax credit carryforwards 
valuation allowances are established when the company determines that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations may not generate sufficient taxable income to realize its deferred tax assets during the carryforward period 
the company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
thus  changes in future results of operations could result in adjustments to the company s valuation allowances 
in  the company has recorded tax expense and a deferred income tax liability of million associated with the intent to repatriate earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in subsequent periods 
the company had historically considered substantially all of the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested in their operations 
if this deferred tax liability had not been recognized  a valuation allowance for domestic net deferred tax assets would have been required 
the company also has earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries where the company considers these earnings to be permanently reinvested in their operations 
as such  no us tax cost has been provided on approximately million of earnings at december  if the company changes its intent related to these earnings additional tax would be required 
contingencies on an ongoing basis  the company assesses potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it  including antitrust related matters 
the company accrues for such liabilities when it determines that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the loss can be made 
determining the outcome of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and expense involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates 
in making the determination of likely outcomes of litigation matters  management considers many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims  the company s experience with similar types of claims  the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed  the existence of other defendants  input from outside legal counsel and the current status of the matter 
the company also assesses the likelihood of recovery from insurance  and  in those cases in which realization of an insurance recovery is deemed probable  the company records a corresponding asset 
the company intends to assert all meritorious legal defenses and will pursue all other equitable factors that are available to it with respect to such matters  however  the resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations and cash flows

the tax law is subject to varied interpretation  and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax provision must be recognized as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
fin also requires additional disclosures about unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain income tax positions and a reconciliation of the change in the unrecognized benefit

outlook the company will continue its strategy of setting prices that reflect the value in use of the company s products and offset as much as possible increases in raw material and energy costs 
in doing so  the company is committed to working with customers to achieve its targeted operating profit margin and  in the case of non flame retardant plastic additives  to recapture profitable volume lost in the second half of this will be critical to maintaining and improving operating profit margins as increases in raw material and energy costs are expected to continue 
increases to raw material and energy costs are anticipated due  in large part  to volatility in the worldwide pricing of hydrocarbon based and precious metal raw materials and natural gas  which the company requires to manufacture its products 
it is generally accepted that pricing of these resources has increased mainly due to procurement competition from emerging economies which the company expects to continue during the company anticipates that will reflect continued strength in the flame retardant  urethanes and petroleum additive product lines  and in the consumer products segment 
the company is actively working to reduce costs within its control 
the company will assess how demand fluctuations have affected manufacturing overhead costs and evaluate ways to control those costs  including the evaluation of manufacturing operations to identify any potential opportunities to optimize those operations and continue to work closely with its customers to maximize profitable volume 
based on results through  the company anticipates the following in on february   an asset purchase agreement was signed by the company to sell its epdm business and certain assets of its rubber chemicals business for million 
the transaction is subject to certain conditions  including regulatory approvals  financing and a comprehensive financial audit 
the company expects the transaction to close in the first half of the company expects that the crop protection segment will stabilize in after recording lower sales volume in due to north american weather  competition in the miticides markets  economic pressures in brazilian agricultural markets and unfavorable manufacturing variances related to production volume 
the company also expects that crop protection revenues will be lower than normal in the first quarter  due to a shift in timing to the second and third quarters owing to changes in customer order timing 
the company continues to drive cost savings opportunities with at least to million net savings expected to cost of products sold in the company has also approved additional savings programs designed to achieve at least million in reductions in sg a and research costs 
the company has budgeted raw material and energy costs increases of approximately million over depreciation and amortization of approximately million  which includes approximately million of additional depreciation due to a change in the estimated useful life of assets related to several of the company s manufacturing facilities 
dividends of approximately million  which reflects the annual dividend of twenty cents per share 
continued focus on the divesture of non core businesses and assets  which may cause a reduction in revenues  cost of products sold  depreciation and sg a expenses 
negotiations for the divesture of non core businesses requires concessions of both the buyer and seller on certain terms  therefore  the impact of these divestures can not be completely assessed until the actual terms of the negotiations are final 
the company continues to focus on cost reduction  pricing  and portfolio realignment initiatives to improve the company s gross profit and operating income margins 
the company is utilizing six sigma  lean manufacturing initiatives and outside consultants to assist in identifying and implementing process improvements and cost reductions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s activities expose its earnings  cash flows and financial position to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and energy prices 
the company maintains a risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments as needed to mitigate risk against foreign currency movements and to manage interest rate and energy price volatility 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company has short term exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting from transactions entered into by the company and its foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currency primarily trade payables and receivables 
the company is also exposed to currency risk on intercompany transactions including intercompany loans 
the company manages these transactional currency risks on a consolidated basis  which allows it to net its exposure 
the company purchases foreign currency forward contracts  primarily denominated in euros  canadian dollars  british pounds sterling  mexican pesos  australian dollars and swiss francs to hedge its transaction exposure 
these contracts are generally settled on a monthly basis 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in other expense  net  to offset the impact of valuing recorded foreign currency trade payables  receivables and intercompany transactions 
the company has not designated these derivatives as hedges under fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  and fasb statement no 
 amendment of statement no 
on derivative instruments and hedging activities  although it believes these instruments help reduce the company s exposure to foreign currency risk 
the net effect of the realized and unrealized gains and losses on these derivatives and the underlying transactions is not significant at december  and the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date for the company s long term debt 
weighted average variable interest rates are based on the applicable floating rate index as of december  interest rate sensitivity in thousands and thereafter total fair value at long term debt fixed rate debt average rate debt variable rate debt average rate debt a a average interest rate is based on rates in effect at december  the company uses price swap contracts as cash flow hedges to convert approximately percent of its forecasted natural gas purchases from variable price to fixed price purchases 
these contracts are designated as hedges of a portion of the company s forecasted natural gas purchases for a rolling three year period 
these contracts involve the exchange of payments over the life of the contracts without an exchange of the notional amount upon which the payments are based 
the differential paid or received as natural gas prices change is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
these amounts are subsequently reclassified into costs of products sold when the related inventory layer is liquidated 
the fair value of the contracts at december  was a loss million  which was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
sensitivity analysis is a technique used to evaluate the impact of hypothetical market value changes 
a hypothetical ten percent increase in the cost of natural gas at december  would result in an increase in the fair market value of the outstanding derivatives by million to a fair market value loss of million  conversely  a hypothetical ten percent decrease in the cost of natural gas would result in a decrease in the fair market value of the outstanding derivatives by million to a fair market value loss of million 
the company has accounts receivable programs to sell accounts receivable to agent banks 
the fees charged for the programs are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
at december   million of domestic accounts receivable have been sold at an average cost of approximately and million of international accounts receivable have been sold at an average cost of approximately 
at december   million of domestic accounts receivable have been sold at an average cost of approximately and million of international accounts receivable have been sold at an average cost of approximately for further information see note accounts receivable programs included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements
