annual performance summary was a pivotal year for management and the board of directors in determining whether the unregulated growth strategy embarked on in was going to achieve the desired results 
the company believed that it needed to achieve sufficient scale in our unregulated operations and to utilize the platform for growth which had been successfully created during the initial phases of our strategy 
this planned growth was deemed necessary by management as a means of achieving the targeted margins  expansion in our business lines  and sufficient returns to our shareholders 
to this end  during management aggressively pursued additional acquisition opportunities which were critical to achieving our intended results  while we also continued efforts to control cost and grow our existing businesses 
it is evident from our financial results that we were not able to achieve our goals 
there were several factors which contributed to the poor financial performance including  but not limited to under performance of our unregulated engineering energy efficiency companies  lack of sufficient revenue growth in our software development company  inability to acquire key companies to achieve scale to support the infrastructure required for these operations  cost of acquisitions not completed  liquidity issues created by under performance in unregulated companies  lower net income from the utility business due to unseasonable weather and increases in expense  and insufficient growth in new product and service lines at the unregulated businesses 
as stated in recent filings  based on these facts  the board and management embarked on a process to reassess the strategic options available to the company to improve overall performance 
given the operational and financial challenges we faced  as well as the departure of the ceo who implemented the growth strategy  the company has begun to pursue the divestiture of the unregulated business lines  which has resulted in the reclassification of these businesses as discontinued operations 
as discussed in more detail in the overview of company strategy section below  the company is formulating a strategy centered on the core utility business and is pursuing plans to divest of all unregulated assets 
overview of company strategy prompted by the underperformance of our unregulated operations  and the departure of the ceo in august  the board undertook a deliberate and detailed review of its strategic options 
with the assistance of a third party financial advisor  the board reviewed and took into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of the company and the financial and operating outlook for each business segment in their review process 
the board considered a number of options including  but not limited to the following continued growth of unregulated businesses  continued operation of existing unregulated business units coupled with cost reduction measures  selling of the company  privatization of some or all business segments  and refocus on the core utility business  maine public service company 
the board decided on a refocus on the core utility business as the preferred strategy  based on five significant and compelling reasons the financial performance of the unregulated businesses was not adequate to warrant continued investment 
the unregulated engineering and software businesses were unable to generate the returns and net cash flows expected by management and our shareholders 
as we indicated in prior filings  we needed to achieve sufficient scale and traction within certain markets to recognize our long term vision with these subsidiaries 
while these companies were able to generate modest revenues  their overall performance did not justify continued investments in new acquisitions or maintenance of existing unregulated operations 
the electric utility  mps  has a history of solid earnings  cash flows and shareholder returns 
as a transmission and distribution  or electricity delivery company  the utility has regulated rates of return which help solidify our ability to maintain a positive financial position for our shareholders 
as a year old company  almost years publicly traded  mps has demonstrated that it is capable of long term success  controlling costs and maintaining the electric system for our customers in a prudent and effective manner  while providing shareholder value 
the company believes that by refocusing its efforts on its core utility practice  the company can correct the negative financial performance associated with its unregulated business operations 
the current political and regulatory environment is increasingly more favorable  allowing for new growth opportunities in regulated operations 
in the late s the electric utility industry underwent the process of deregulation 
in an effort to promote competition and therefore lower energy prices  the state of maine passed legislation requiring the sale of all electricity generating assets by the state s three investor owned electric utilities  including mps 
seven years later  it has become apparent that these decisions have not yielded the results sought by lawmakers 
at the same time  the combination of the need for electricity in congested areas of new england  the lack of significant generation being commissioned  and the related need for investment in transmission assets to alleviate the ever growing demand for electricity  have all improved to some extent the opportunity landscape available to our utility business 
new generation in the form of maine s largest wind farm is now located within mps s service territory 
mps is pursing the development of a large scale transmission project which has the potential to produce substantial returns and connect mps to the new england grid 
further  new legislation has been introduced in the state of maine to remove the barrier for in state utilities to once again own electricity generating assets 
all of these factors  when combined  position mps to provide long term shareholder value 
the company  management  and the employee s core competencies are utility based 
the company s current executive team is well steeped in utility operations and regulatory affairs 
to ensure the proper alignment of skills necessary for the future success of the company  the board is currently considering the revised strategy in its process to hire a new ceo 
most importantly  the board believes returning to the core utility is the best strategy to preserve  sustain  and grow shareholder value 
the regulated utility segment of our business remains profitable with positive expectations for continued profitability in the future 
we believe that our utility base of operations is well positioned to leverage opportunities as we move forward 
we will  however  not be without financial and operating challenges during the transition period between the divestiture of our unregulated operations and re focusing our efforts on optimizing the value of our core utility business 
short term liquidity during that period will continue to be strained 
in addition  we will have to remain diligent and steadfast in our efforts to control costs  while making prudent investments in the regulated utility business 
in the end  we believe a change in strategy is required for us to succeed in providing the necessary performance expected by our shareholders
