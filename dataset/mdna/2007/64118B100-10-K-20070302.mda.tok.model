item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
on february   we completed the acquisition of cypress semiconductor corporation s cypress network search engine nse products pursuant to an agreement for the purchase and sale of assets entered into on january   as amended 
upon closing the transaction  we acquired assets relating to cypress nse business  including all intellectual property related primarily to the acquired nse business including all intellectual property related to the sahasra algorithmic technology  the nse and ayama product families and all inventory and fixed assets for those product families the business 
we did not acquire any of cypress tcam  tcam  tcam cr  turbocam or toy cam products and inventory 
to date we have paid cypress approximately million in shares of common stock for the acquired assets 
we may be required to pay an additional million in cash and up to approximately million in shares of common stock if we achieve specific revenue objectives as outlined in the agreement 
the sahasra algorithmic technology complements our layer processing initiative and is a beneficial building block in driving towards low cost layer applications acceleration and security processing solutions 
in addition  the nse  ayama and ayama expanded our product offerings in the high volume  entry level layer switch market 
the discussions in this section of the annual report on form k  as well as the financial statements contained herein  include the effects of this acquisition from february   the date on which the transaction was completed 
overview we are a semiconductor company that designs  develops and markets high performance knowledge based processors for a variety of advanced wireline and wireless networking systems  such as routers  switches  wireless infrastructure equipment  network security appliances  network access equipment and networked storage devices 
our knowledge based processors accelerate a wide variety of complex functions to enable emerging quad play networks and services  or the convergence of voice  video  data and mobility over a single unified internet protocol infrastructure 
knowledge based processors are integrated circuits that employ an advanced processor architecture and a large knowledge or signature database containing information on the network  as well as applications and content that run on the network to make complex decisions about individual packets of information traveling through the network 
our knowledge based processors significantly enhance the ability of networking original equipment manufacturers  or oems  to supply network service providers with systems offering more advanced functionality for the internet  such as high definition video delivery over the internet  or iptv  voice transmission over the internet  or voip  unified threat management  or utm  virtual private networks  or vpns  rich content delivery over mobile wireless networks  and streaming video and audio 
our knowledge based processors incorporate advanced technologies that enable rapid processing  such as a superscalar architecture  which uses parallel processing techniques  and deep pipelining  which segments processing tasks into smaller sub tasks  for higher decision throughput 
these technologies enable networking systems to perform a broad range of network aware and content aware processing functions  such as application based routing  utm network security  intrusion detection and prevention  virus inspection  access control for network security  prioritization of traffic flow to maintain quality of service  or qos  and statistical measurement of internet traffic for transaction billing 
since the second half of  we have experienced significant revenue growth caused by a rapid rise in new customer orders for our knowledge based processors 
our total revenue increased by from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  and by from fiscal to million for fiscal our total revenue for fiscal year ended december  was million  which increased over fiscal 
table of contents as a fabless semiconductor company  our business is less capital intensive than others because we rely on third parties to manufacture  assemble  and test our products 
in general  we do not anticipate making significant capital expenditures 
in the future  as we launch new products or expand our operations  however  we may require additional funds to procure product mask sets  order elevated quantities of wafers from our foundry partners  perform qualification testing and assemble and test those products 
we employ a direct sales force as well as a sales representative network to sell our products 
the majority of our revenue comes from customers headquartered in the united states  however  we also earn a significant amount from customers headquartered in countries outside the united states 
all revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
our product sales cycles can take up to months to complete and volume production can take an additional six months to be achieved  if at all 
cancellations of customer orders or changes in product specifications might result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory or operating expenses 
our recent rapid revenue growth makes it difficult for us to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
in general  we recognize revenue at the time of shipment to our customers or our international stocking sales representatives 
our revenue consists primarily of sales of our knowledge based processors to networking oems and contract manufacturers 
initial sales of our products for a new design are usually made directly to networking oems 
once a design enters production  a networking oem often outsources its manufacturing to contract manufacturers that purchase products directly from us 
as a consequence of the acquisition of nse business from cypress  we began selling our products to a distributor in february we offer price protection and limited stock rotation rights to this distributor 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of returns and price protection and other credits potentially issuable to this distributor  revenues and costs relating to sales to this distributor are deferred  on a gross basis  until such rights lapse  which is generally upon receiving notification from this distributor that it has resold the products to our end customer 
because we purchase all wafers from suppliers with fabrication facilities and outsource the assembly and testing to third party vendors  a significant portion of our costs of revenue consists of payments to our third party vendors 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our suppliers and rely upon them to fulfill our orders 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel as well as costs related to new and existing product development  depreciation  software maintenance and facilities costs 
all research and development costs are expensed in the period incurred 
in order for us to remain competitive  we believe a significant portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development efforts 
we also believe research and development headcount will increase in the future  and that research and development costs will increase in absolute dollars but decline as a percentage of revenue 
selling expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel  marketing programs  travel  facilities overhead and bonuses and commissions for independent sales representatives 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for finance and accounting  patent and corporate legal expenses  and facilities overhead 
our operating expenses are denominated primarily in us dollars  except for expenses incurred by our wholly owned subsidiary in india  which are denominated in the local currency 
the expenses incurred by our subsidiary in india  excluding any foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses which are recorded in other income expense  net  were included in research and development expenses 
beginning in fiscal  our cost of revenue and operating expenses include stock based compensation recorded in accordance with fas r 
for the year ended december   our cost of revenue  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses included stock based compensation of million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make fair and reasonable estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities and operating expenses during the period reported 
the following accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates  our financial statements could be materially impacted 
our estimates are guided by observing the following critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue mainly from product sales and  to a lesser extent  from engineering services 
except for shipments to one distributor  we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  legal title and risk of ownership has transferred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
our sales agreements do not provide for any customer acceptance provisions or return rights 
we have no obligation to provide any modification or customization  upgrades  enhancements  post contract customer support  additional products or enhancements 
customers  other than the distributor discussed below  have no rights of return unless the product does not perform according to specifications 
provisions for warranty expenses are recorded when revenue is recognized 
as a consequence of the acquisition of nse business from cypress  we began selling our products to a distributor in february we offer price protection and limited stock rotation rights to this distributor 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of returns and price protection and other credits potentially issuable to this distributor  revenues and costs relating to the sales to this distributor are deferred  on a gross basis  until such rights lapse  which is generally upon receiving notification from this distributor that it has resold the products to our end customer 
from time to time we perform engineering services for third parties 
engineering service revenue is recognized as services are performed  agreed upon milestones are achieved and customer acceptance  if required  is received from the customer 
inventory valuation and adverse purchase commitments 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
these estimates are generally based on a month forecast prepared by management 
if our inventory on hand is in excess of our forecast  the excess amounts are reserved 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those expected by management  additional adjustment to inventory valuation may be required 
the carrying value of inventory and the determination of possible adverse purchase commitments are dependent on our estimate of the yield that will be achieved  or the percent of good products identified when the product is tested 
a small change in yield could result in a significant adjustment and have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
warranty accrual 
our products are subject to warranty for a period ranging from one to five years from the date of sale and we provide for the estimated future costs of replacement upon shipment of the product in the accompanying statements of operations 
our warranty accrual is estimated based on historical claims compared to historical revenue and assumes that we have to replace products subject to a claim 
for new products  we use our historical percentage for the appropriate class of product 
should actual product failure rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
in the future  as we continue to introduce new products  warranty expenses may increase 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in order to determine the collectability of our accounts receivable  we continually assess factors such as previous customer transactions and the credit worthiness of the customer 
to date  our accounts receivable write offs have been immaterial 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for 
table of contents estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make required payments 
in general  such allowances are established for accounts aged over days from the invoice date  unless specific circumstances indicate that the balance is collectible 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
in applying sfas  we are required to estimate our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
we have established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding our ability to realize these assets 
these uncertainties relate primarily to the level of our historical losses and the absence of objective evidence supporting the future realization of these assets 
in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes merton valuation model the black scholes model  consistent with the provisions of sfas r  sab and our prior period pro forma disclosures of net income  including stock based compensation determined under a fair value method as prescribed by sfas the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life  the price volatility of the underlying stock and future forfeitures and related tax effects 
the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using both the historical and implied volatility of the company s common stock 
changes in the subjective assumptions required in the valuation models may significantly affect the estimated value of the awards  the related stock based compensation expense and  consequently  our results of operations 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue  cost of revenue and gross profit the table below sets forth the fluctuations in revenue  cost of revenue and gross profit data for the years ended december  and in thousands  except percentage data year ended december  percentage of revenue year ended december  percentage of revenue year to year increase increase percentage revenue cost of revenue gross profit revenue 
the increase in total revenue during the year ended december  resulted from the continued growth in sales of our knowledge based processors and from sales of products associated with the purchase of the cypress nse business 
during the year ended december   the volume of our knowledge based processor shipments increased approximately over fiscal the increase in our knowledge based processor sales for the year ended december  was driven by a million increase in the sales of our nl products  which was introduced in early  as well as a million increase in the sales of our nl products over fiscal revenue for the year ended december  also included approximately million from sales of the acquired nse products 
the average selling price of our products in fiscal decreased as compared to fiscal primarily due to lower average selling prices for the acquired nse products  which was lower than that of our knowledge based processor products in the recent period 

table of contents revenue from sales to cisco and its contract manufacturers represented of total revenue for the year ended december  compared to during the year ended december  the decrease in sales to cisco and its contract manufacturers as a percentage of sales in was due to the growth of sales to other customers 
revenue for the year ended december  also included million of nre revenue 
no such revenue was recorded in fiscal we do not expect to generate this type of revenue regularly  however  we may enter into agreements that will generate nre revenue from time to time 
during the latter part of the year ended december   inventory level adjustments at some of our larger customers and slowing demand from our japanese customers resulted in reduced levels of new orders and slower revenue growth 
it appears that the inventory level adjustments were due to excess order placements by our customers in prior quarters to offset an anticipated shortage of organic substrates from suppliers used for some of our knowledge based processors 
it appears  however  that these suppliers did not experience such a shortage  but  as a consequence of their excess order placements earlier in the year  some of our larger customers were left with excess inventory of our knowledge based processors 
we believe this inventory level adjustment will not affect us materially in the future as our largest customers appear to have completed their adjustment process during the fourth quarter of fiscal cost of revenue gross profit gross margin 
the increase in cost of revenue and gross profit during the year ended december  was primarily due to the continued growth in sales of our knowledge based processors 
improvements in our production yields also contributed to the increase in gross profit 
during the year ended december  and  we recorded a provision for excess and obsolete inventory reserve of million and million  respectively  for inventory that is not saleable 
the cost of revenue during the year ended december  included an additional provision of warranty reserve of million to address a warranty issue related to specific devices sold to one of our international customers  and approximately million of stock based compensation expense under sfas r that was inapplicable in the devices were tested by both us and the customer and passed quality assurance inspection at the time they were sold 
the customer subsequently identified malfunctioning systems that included our devices 
no specific warranty reserve was provided for additional units shipped subsequent to june  as the customer modified the software associated with its products to remedy the observed malfunction 
as of december   we maintained million of warranty reserves for anticipated replacement costs of the parts sold to this customer 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  also included million of amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of cypress nse business 
the nre revenue of million during the year ended december  had no associated cost  and accordingly generated gross margin 
gross margin for the year ended december  was benefited by million from the sale of products that had been fully reserved in prior periods and accordingly had no associated cost of revenue 
this amount represented approximately of the gross margin during the year ended december

research and development expenses increased during the year ended december   as compared to fiscal  primarily due to increases in stock based compensation expense of million  payroll related expenses of million  of which million was due to the acquisition of cypress nse business  consulting expenses of million  masks  tooling and product testing expenses of million  and product development and qualification expenses of million as we continue to invest in the development of the next generation knowledge based processor products as well as non knowledge based processor products 
depreciation expense increased by million during the year ended december  as we purchased software and other tools to support our research and development efforts 
the increase in stock based compensation expense was due to the adoption of sfas no 
r effective january  the remainder of the increase in research and development expenses was caused by individually minor items 
in process research and development 
as part of the purchase price allocation in connection with the acquisition of the cypress nse business  we recorded an in process research and development iprd charge of million during the year ended december  based upon our estimate of the fair values of assets acquired 
we acquired only one iprd project  which is related to the acquired sahasra algorithmic technology  that has not reached technological feasibility  and has no alternative use 
the sahasra algorithmic technology complements our layer processing initiative and is a beneficial building block in driving towards low cost layer applications acceleration and security processing solutions 
to date  there have been no significant differences between the actual and estimated results of the iprd project 
as of december   we incurred total post acquisition costs of approximately million related to the iprd project and estimate that an additional investment of approximately million will be required to complete the project 
we expect to complete the project by june and to benefit from it beginning in fiscal  which is consistent with our original estimate 
the development of the acquired technology remains a significant risk due to factors including the remaining efforts to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products  and competitive threats 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning  designing  experimenting  and testing activities necessary to determine that the technology can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased during the year ended december   as compared to fiscal  primarily due to increases in stock based 
table of contents compensation expense of million  payroll related expenses of million  and legal expenses of million 
the increase in stock based compensation expense was due to the adoption of sfas no

the net interest and other income of million generated during the year ended december  was due to a higher average cash and investment balance during the period and higher market yields for our chosen investments 
provision for income taxes 
income tax expense was million and million for the years ended december  and our effective tax rate in and was significantly less than statutory rates because we utilized net operating loss carry forwards  from which no previous benefit had been recognized to offset taxable income in the us stock based compensation under sfas no 
r on january   the company adopted sfas r  on the modified prospective application method  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based awards made to the company s employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases outstanding as of and awarded after january  the total stock based compensation expense recognized for the year ended december  was allocated as follows in thousands year ended december  cost of revenues research and development selling  general and administrative total stock based compensation expense in addition  we capitalized approximately million of stock based compensation in inventory as of december   which represented indirect manufacturing costs related to our inventory

research and development expenses increased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to increases in product development and qualification expenses of million  payroll related expenses of million and consulting expenses of million as we continued to invest in the development of the next generation knowledge based processor products as well as new non knowledge based processor products 
in addition  depreciation expense and software maintenance expense increased by million and million  respectively  during the year ended december  as we purchased software licenses to support our research and development efforts 
during the year ended december   we also incurred million of expenses associated with our new design center in bangalore  india  which consisted primarily of payroll related costs for engineers 
the remainder of the increase in research and development expenses was caused by individually minor items 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to increases in directors and officers insurance premium of million  payroll related costs of million  accounting and consulting expenses of million  investor relations expense of million  sales commission of million and state and local taxes of million 
the increases in directors and officers insurance premium and investor relations expenses occurred subsequent to our initial public offering in july the increase in payroll related costs was due to increased headcount to support our growing operations and the accrual of management bonuses pursuant to an incentive bonus plan  which was adopted for fiscal the increase in accounting and consulting expenses primarily related to our on going effort to document  evaluate and test our system of internal control over financial reporting as we prepare to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of the increase in commission expense was the result of a significant sales increase during the year ended december  the increase in state and local taxes was primarily due to the increased business activities in the states where we conduct business 
the increases in expenses were offset by the release of the allowance for bad debt of million as we continue to improve cash collections

the net interest and other income of million generated during the year ended december  was due to a higher average cash and investment balance during the period and higher market yields for our chosen investments 
the higher average cash and investment balance during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the cash generated from operating activities  which totaled million during fiscal the higher interest expense during the year ended december  resulted primarily from the accelerated amortization of beneficial conversion feature and warrants that were originally recorded in connection with the issuance of 
table of contents promissory notes in march the promissory notes were repaid in full in july  and accordingly  the remaining value of beneficial conversion feature at the time of repayment was entirely charged to interest expense 
during the year ended december   amortization of beneficial conversion feature and warrant fair values totaled million 
interest expense for the year ended december  also included the amounts associated with the outstanding balance under the lines of credit 
all outstanding amounts under the lines of credit and convertible promissory notes were paid off in july and our credit lines expired in october liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity were our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments which totaled million

the cash generated was offset by the increase in accounts receivable of million on higher sales of our knowledge based processors during the period  an increase in inventory of million primarily due to the addition of nse products acquired from cypress and a decrease in accounts payable of million due to the timing of payments to our vendors 
our investing activities used cash of million during the year ended december   of which million was for the purchase of short term investments 
we used million to purchase computer equipment and research and development design tools to support our growing operations 
we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal these capital expenditures will be used primarily to support product development activities 
we will use our cash and cash equivalents to fund these purchases 
we paid approximately million for expenses directly associated with the acquisition of the nse business from cypress semiconductor corp 
our financing activities provided net cash of million for the year ended december   primarily from stock option exercises 
cash provided by financing activities was offset by repayment of software license and other obligations 
cash flows during the year ended december  during the year ended december   our operating activities generated net cash of million 
for cash provided by operating activities  our primary source was net income of million  adjusted for non cash items of million primarily related to depreciation  amortization of deferred stock based compensation and provision for inventory reserves 
the provision for inventory reserves of million was primarily related to the 
table of contents write off of approximately million of inventory during the second quarter of the inventory write off was related to specific inventory that we mutually agreed with our foundry partner did not meet specifications 
this write off did not impact our cash flows during the year ended december  as we received wafer credits from the foundry partner for the same amount 
cash was also generated from increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in accounts receivable resulted from our continued effort to improve cash collections 
the increases in accounts payable and accruals were primarily due to the growth of our overall operations and the timing of vendor invoice payments 
the primary use of cash for operating activities during the year ended december  was for inventory  which increased as we ramped up our production volume in order to meet our customers increasing demand for knowledge based processors 
our investing activities used cash of million during the year ended december  cash was primarily used to purchase research and development design tools and computer equipment to support our growing operations 
our financing activities provided net cash of million for the year ended december  the primary sources of cash were the proceeds from exercises of stock options and repayment of stockholder notes received  which were offset by repayment of software license and other obligations 
cash flows during the year ended december  during the year ended december   our operating activities used net cash of million 
cash used in operating activities consisted of a net loss of million adjusted for non cash items primarily related to depreciation  amortization of stock based compensation and interest expense  which included the amortization and write off of discount related to the issuance of promissory notes 
the primary use of cash for operating activities during the year ended december  was for our inventory  which increased as we ramped up our production volume in order to meet our customers increasing demand for our knowledge based processors 
in addition  the significant growth in our product sales in increased accounts receivable and lowered our operating cash flows 
cash was also used to reduce our accrued liabilities as we settled our product warranty obligations during the period and used a portion of our initial public offering proceeds to reduce our overall liability balance 
other uses of cash for operating activities included an increase in prepaid and other assets due to the payment of a directors and officers insurance premium in connection with our initial public offering  and a decrease in deferred revenue as we completed our obligation under the agreement with micron 
cash used for activities related to inventory  accounts receivable  accrued liabilities  prepaid and other assets and deferred revenue was offset by an increase in accounts payable due to the growth in our operations 
our investing activities provided net cash of million during the year ended december  cash was provided by the sale of short term investments and the reduction in restricted cash as our amended line of credit agreement with a bank no longer required a restricted cash deposit 
cash provided by the sale of short term investments and the reduction in restricted cash was offset by the acquisition of property and equipment totaling million 
the property and equipment expenditures were primarily for purchases of computer equipment and research and development design tools to support our growing operations 
our financing activities provided net cash of million for the year ended december  the primary source of cash was the net proceeds received in connection with our initial public offering of million 
the other sources of cash included the issuance of convertible promissory notes  repayment of stockholder notes received  proceeds from exercises of stock options and warrants and borrowings under the line of credit 
cash provided by these activities was offset by repayment of convertible promissory notes  repayment of the outstanding balance under the working capital line and the payments for software license obligations 

table of contents capital resources we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance of million will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the amount of revenue we generate  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
however  if we do not meet our plan  we could be required  or might elect  to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we also might decide to raise additional capital at such times and upon such terms as management considers favorable and in the interests of the company  including  but not limited to  from the sale of up to million of our debt and or equity securities before reductions for expenses  underwriting discounts and commissions under our shelf registration statement 
contractual obligations our principal commitments as of december  are summarized below in thousands total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations software license obligations wafer purchases other total in addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations quantified in the table above  we have other obligations for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business 
these obligations  however  either are not enforceable or legally binding or are subject to change based on our business decisions 
other obligations shown above represent million of adverse purchase commitments for which the inventory is considered unsalable 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  or spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
indemnities  commitments and guarantees in the normal course of business  we have made certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include agreements to indemnify our customers with respect to liabilities associated with the infringement of other parties technology based upon our products  obligation to indemnify our lessors under facility lease agreements  and obligation to indemnify our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of delaware 
the duration of such indemnification obligations  commitments and guarantees varies and  in certain cases  is indefinite 
we have not recorded any liability for any such indemnification obligations  commitments and guarantees in the accompanying balance sheets 
we do  however  accrue for losses for any known contingent liability  including those that may arise from indemnification provisions  when future payment is probable 

table of contents under master purchase agreements signed with cisco in november  we have agreed to indemnify cisco for costs incurred in rectifying epidemic failures  up to the greater of on a per claim basis of all amounts paid to us by cisco during the preceding months or million  plus replacement costs 
if we are required to make payments under the indemnity  our operating results may be adversely affected 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue how taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
we are required to adopt the provisions of eitf beginning in we do not expect the provisions of eitf to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb sfas  accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation defines the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin is effective for the company in the first fiscal quarter of the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
