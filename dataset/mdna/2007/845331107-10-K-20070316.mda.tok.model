item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation certain contractual commitments and indemnities for additional information 
environmental and water quality risks our services group is subject to environmental and water quality risks 
we operate facilities on behalf of our clients under contract 
these facilities must be operated in accordance with various federal and state water quality standards 
we also handle certain hazardous materials at these facilities  such as chlorine gas and hydrogen sulfide 
any failures of our operation of the facilities  including sewage spills  noncompliance with water quality standards  hazardous material leaks and spills  and similar events  could expose us to environmental liabilities  claims and litigation costs 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully manage these issues  and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
escalating costs our operating costs  construction costs and costs of providing services may rise faster than our revenues 
many of our contracts with municipalities include contractual price increases tied to national consumer price indices 
however  our costs are subject to market conditions and other factors  which may increase significantly higher than a generalized price index 
the largest component of our operating costs is made up of salaries and wages 
these costs are affected by the local supply and demand for qualified labor 
other large components of our costs are general liability insurance  workers compensation insurance  employee benefits and health insurance costs 
these costs may increase at rates higher than the applicable general price index and therefore may result in a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
contract cancellations our operations and maintenance contracts may be canceled  reducing our revenues and service backlog 
also  we may not secure new construction and construction management projects on a consistent basis  leading to fluctuations in revenues and backlog 
our service group revenue backlog consists of new and existing contracts 
we include new contracts in the backlog when we have a signed contract 
revenues included in our backlog may be realized over a multi year period 
the contracts signed by our services group typically have durations of three to five years and some are cancelable with to days prior notice 
the uncompleted portion of base revenue for these existing contracts is reflected in the backlog 
although our services group tends to experience high renewal rates  municipalities and cities periodically change operators or terminate outsourcing at the end of a contract 
the inability to renew existing contracts could have a material adverse impact on our services group 
in addition  a municipality could cancel a long term contract without notice 
this would result in loss of revenues and operating profits and may result in litigation if a breach of contract occurs 
regulatory environment changes in the regulatory environment may adversely affect our results of operations 
our utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by governmental agencies 
in some states  regulators are elected by popular vote  and the results of elections may change the rules and policies of the agency 
changes in rules and policies  including policies allowing our services group to provide operations and maintenance  construction and construction management services to our regulated utilities at fair market value  may adversely impact our operating results 
other risk factors capital resources our capital resources may restrict our ability to operate and expand our business 
we anticipate that our available line of credit borrowing capacity  cash balances  cash flow generated from operations  and execution of additional financing alternatives will enable us to continue operating and expanding our business 
we may be unable to renew our credit facilities when they expire 
we may be unable to execute additional financing alternatives at terms that we find acceptable 
if we were unable to renew our existing lines of credit  or if we were unable to execute additional financing alternatives  our capital spending would be reduced or delayed and any future acquisitions would also be delayed or eliminated 
while we have the ability to take these actions  they could negatively impact our revenues  revenue growth and profitability 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation certain contractual commitments and indemnities for additional information 
debt covenants we are subject to debt covenants 
we are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under some of our loan and debt agreements 
failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing  and we could face penalties  increased borrowing costs  litigation  acceleration of maturity schedules and cross default issues 
such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
geographic diversity our operations are subject to certain risks due to their location 
we own or operate water and wastewater facilities in numerous locations in numerous states and  consequently  we are subject to widely differing weather  political  water supply  labor supply  utility cost  regulatory  economic and other risks in the areas we service 
we cannot control these risks 
however  we believe that our broad geographic service area  while exposing us to these risks in numerous local markets  provides us a certain amount of geographical diversification against these risks at a consolidated company level 
internal control weaknesses internal control weaknesses could have an adverse effect on us 
insufficient internal controls could result in lack of compliance with contractual agreements  misstatements in our financial statements in amounts that could be material and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock 
controls that function effectively today may become inadequate due to changes in conditions 
information technology we rely on a number of complex business systems that could malfunction 
our businesses are dependent on several complex business systems that must function reliably in order for us to operate effectively 
among other things  system malfunctions could prevent us from operating or monitoring our facilities  billing accurately and timely analyzing financial results 
our profitability and cash flow could be impacted negatively in the event these systems do not operate effectively 
uninsured risks we retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies 
we evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually 
our evaluation considers the costs  risks and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage 
retained risks are associated with deductible limits  partial self insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings 
we cannot assure you that we will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have retained or that such uninsured losses will not affect our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations

item legal proceedings on january   the albuquerque bernalillo county water utility authority  a political subdivision of the state of new mexico  and the city of rio rancho  a home rule municipal corporation  as petitioners  filed a petition for condemnation against new mexico utilities  inc  a new mexico corporation  and others  as defendants  in the second judicial district court  county of bernalillo  state of new mexico  no 
cv the action 
new mexico utilities  inc nmui is one of our wholly owned regulated utilities 
the petition seeks to acquire  by condemnation  all of the assets of nmui  including all real property  through the alleged power of eminent domain 
the petition also alleges that the petitioners need to acquire the nmui assets for the public purposes of providing water and wastewater services to nmui customers and that the acquisition of nmui is necessary  appropriate and in the public interest 
we believe we have defenses to the action which we intend to vigorously assert 
if we do not prevail  the petitioners must pay fair market value as determined by the court  based on appraisals 
nmui and the petitioners do not agree on the value of the assets which the petitioners seek to condemn 
while it is too early to predict the outcome of this matter  we believe that the fair market value of the nmui utility exceeds its recorded net book value as of december  on may   one of our operating subsidiaries received a subpoena to provide records to a grand jury 
the requested records relate to the operations of the san simeon wastewater treatment plant in california for the period january to the date of the subpoena

operating income for the five years ended december  includes reimbursement of incremental costs pursuant to a settlement agreement 
in  we were required to remove some of our wells from service due to chemical contamination 
this has resulted in our california utility purchasing a significant portion of its water supply from other sources since in may  a settlement agreement was reached among some of the parties allegedly responsible for the contamination and certain water entities  including our california water utility 
pursuant to the agreement  we received reimbursement of million per share  net of tax in for incremental water and energy costs incurred in  and because of the contamination 
since this reimbursement was an unusual event  we recorded the million in other income rather than as an increase to operating income in accordance with the provisions of apb no

overview southwest water company provides a broad range of services including water production  treatment and distribution  wastewater collection and treatment  utility billing and collection  utility infrastructure construction management  and public works services 
we own regulated public utilities and also serve cities  utility districts and private companies under contract 
our subsidiaries are segmented into two operating groups our utility group and our services group 
utility group our utility group owns public water and wastewater utilities in alabama  california  new mexico  oklahoma and texas and  beginning in february  mississippi 
except for our california utility  our utilities are operated by companies in our services group  which we describe below 
state and federal agencies issue regulations regarding standards of water quality  safety  environmental and other matters which affect these operations 
the rates that our regulated utility subsidiaries charge for water and wastewater usage are established by state or local authorities 
utility group revenues reflect fees earned for the production and distribution of water and the collection and treatment of sewage for residential  business  industrial and public authority use 
the group s operating expenses reflect the costs associated with purchasing  producing and distributing water  collecting and treating wastewater  salaries  wages and employee benefits  facilities costs  supplies and equipment  repairs and maintenance  professional fees and other costs 
services group our services group operates our contract service businesses in which we operate and maintain water and wastewater facilities owned by cities  public agencies  municipal utility districts  private entities and investor owned utilities  including most of our own utilities 
our services group operates primarily in alabama  california  colorado  georgia  mississippi  new mexico  south dakota and texas 
while state and federal agencies issue regulations regarding standards of water quality  safety  environmental and other matters which affect these operations  our services group s pricing is not subject to regulation 
services group revenues reflect fees earned for water and wastewater facility operations and maintenance services  equipment maintenance and repair  sewer pipeline cleaning  billing and collection services  public works and state certified water and wastewater laboratory analysis 
our services group also facilitates the design  construction  project management and operating aspects of various water and wastewater projects 
the group s operating expenses reflect salaries  wages and employee benefits  facilities costs  supplies and equipment  repairs and maintenance  professional fees and other costs 
most work performed by the services group is required to be performed by state licensed and certified technicians 
some companies in our services group provide construction  operations and maintenance services to our utility group and recognize a profit on those services 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas  we do not eliminate the services group s profit because management believes the sales price is reasonable and it is probable that  through the rate making process  future utility group revenue approximately equal to the sales price will result from the regulated utilities use of the services 
we do  however  eliminate revenues to the extent of the related costs in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the guidance provided in sfas selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of costs related to personnel  facilities  insurance  consulting and professional services  which support our sales  marketing  human resources  finance and administration functions for the entire company 
acquisitions and dispositions our financial position  results of operations and cash flows have been affected by our history of acquisitions and  in  a disposition 
our most recent significant acquisitions  which affect the comparability of the historical financial condition and results of operations described in the md a  are utility group monarch utilities  a texas based water utility  acquired in july  an alabama based wastewater collection and treatment system  which we operate as southwest water alabama  in september  services group ace technologies  a texas based water and wastewater testing laboratory  acquired in september  and novus utilities  an alabama based contract operations company  acquired in march in june we sold master tek international  inc  our submetering business that provided multi family residential utility metering  billing and collection services for residential properties 
the sale of this business  which was part of our services group  is not expected to affect the operations of our remaining businesses in the services group or our utility group 
as a result of the sale  the business we sold is reflected as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements and the discussion below reflects only continuing operations for all periods 
new mexico eminent domain condemnation proceedings in  the albuquerque bernalillo county water utility authority and the city of rio rancho  new mexico  filed a petition for condemnation the petition against our new mexico regulated utility  new mexico utilities  inc nmui 
the petition seeks to acquire  by condemnation  all of the assets of nmui  including all real property  through the alleged power of eminent domain 
the petition also alleges that the petitioners need to acquire the utility assets for the public purposes of providing water and wastewater services to customers and that the acquisition of nmui is necessary  appropriate and in the public interest 
we believe we have defenses to the action which we intend to vigorously assert 
if we do not prevail  the petitioners must pay fair market value as determined by the court  based on appraisals 
nmui and the petitioners do not agree on the value of the assets which the petitioners seek to condemn 
while it is too early to predict the outcome of this matter  we believe that the fair market value of the nmui utility exceeds its recorded net book value as of december  for additional information  see item legal proceedings of this report 
business outlook the water and wastewater industry generates annual revenues in excess of billion in the united states 
both services are primarily owned by government municipalities 
growing regulatory complexity and escalating water quality awareness has led to a dwindling supply of low cost potable water 
the market is characterized by an aging and deteriorating municipal infrastructure and there is minimal state and federal government funding available to upgrade these systems to meet the higher standards 
the epa estimates that an investment of to million may be needed over the next years to meet the higher standards 
these factors lead us to a very positive outlook for growth in our industry as more government entities look to the private sector to help them meet these challenges 
we intend to grow our market share of this industry by focusing on both increasing the number of utilities we own and on increasing the dollars generated by operating and maintaining government owned utilities 
our long term strategic plan is to increase our profitability through acquisitions and organic growth in both our utility group and our services group 
the utility group growth strategy focuses on strategically located acquisitions  organic customer growth and actively managed rate proceedings 
we look to acquire strategic utilities located within our geographic footprint  thereby expanding our presence in a region and gaining economies of scale 
we also look to acquire utilities in population growth areas 
historically  our utilities in population growth areas experience new development in their service areas which generates organic growth through increased customer connections 
to ensure a reasonable rate of return on investments in our capital assets  we manage rate proceedings through our relationships with public utility commissions 
the services group growth strategy focuses on expanding our client base  making strategic acquisitions and providing peripheral services such as construction of infrastructure  billing and collection services  customer care call centers  meter replacement and laboratory analysis of water and wastewater samples 
by pursuing new operations and maintenance contracts with cities  municipalities and private owners of water and wastewater utilities within our geographic footprint  we expand our presence in a region and gain economies of scale 
we look to expand the scope of our contracts with current clients by adding additional services such as billing and collections and providing capital improvement project management services 
an opportunity unique to our business model is that it includes an integrated strategy in which the services group provides construction and operation and maintenance services to our utility group 
this provides us with economies of scale 
we also continue to pursue acquisitions of small  strategic service companies that expand our geographic presence and give us knowledge of the regions water and wastewater needs 
this local knowledge positions us for growth both in the service as well as the utility side of the business as municipalities look to form public private partnerships or to sell their utility assets 
this was demonstrated in march by our acquisition of novus utilities  a contract operations business in alabama which gave us local knowledge and relationships in the region 
this positioning in turn led to the acquisition of a utility business  southwest water alabama  in september results of operations compared to revenues

we will continue this effort in and expect to show continued improvement 
services group gross profit on revenues from our utility group increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year

selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the following a million increase in salaries  wages and related benefits resulting from workforce increases to support our business growth  a million increase related to one time charges for relocation assistance extended to our new ceo  a million increase attributable to acquisitions which occurred in  and a million increase in legal and other professional fees  relating to certain litigation and other routine legal and administrative proceedings arising during the ordinary course of business  offset by a million decrease in sarbanes oxley compliance related costs

during  charges totaling million have been recorded to reflect the impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
as required by sfas  we test goodwill annually for impairment at the reporting unit level  as of october st of each year  or when events or circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment using discounted cash flow methodologies  transaction values for comparable companies  and other valuation techniques for reporting units with goodwill balances 
the realizability of the company s long lived assets  including goodwill  is dependent on expected future cash flows from the underlying operations 
during the second quarter of  we reviewed the business strategy for our water and wastewater testing laboratory reporting unit 
this review resulted in our decision to realign the operations by reducing the size and scope of its business activities and focusing on its core operations and customers 
this realignment is intended to create a strong foundation for providing high quality laboratory testing and reporting services to municipal utility districts and targeted commercial customers  enhancing future growth and performance 
the carrying value of the entity was tested for impairment using the revised cash flow projections and it was determined that carrying values were not fully recoverable 
as a result  million of goodwill associated with the laboratory reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and was charged to expense in the second quarter of during the third quarter of  a significant contract at the testing laboratory was not renewed 
the carrying value of the entity was tested again for impairment using the revised cash flow projections and it was determined that carrying values were not recoverable 
as a result  the remaining million of goodwill associated with the laboratory reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and was charged to expense in the third quarter of additionally  in the second quarter of we determined that the renewal of a primary contract for another reporting unit was not likely to occur  significantly reducing future estimated cash flows of the reporting unit 
as a result  million of goodwill associated with this reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and was charged to expense during that period 
other income expense 
other expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period during the prior year as follows in thousands change interest expense interest income other total interest expense

the major components of interest expense were as follows in thousands change revolving lines of credit mortgage bonds and bank term loans convertible subordinated debentures other indebtedness total interest incurred less capitalized interest total interest expense the increase in total interest incurred is primarily due to an increase in borrowings levels on our mortgage bonds and bank term loans and an increase in interest rates related to our revolving line of credit 
average balances of interest bearing debt outstanding increased to million in compared to million in the added borrowings were used to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions 
the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
provision for income taxes 
our effective consolidated income tax rate was for the year ended december  and is comparable to for the prior year based on combined pre tax income and related income taxes for both continuing and discontinued operations 
our effective tax rate for reflects the million reversal of a capital loss carryforward deferred tax asset valuation allowance as further described below 
during the year ended december   we recognized a capital loss of million for income tax purposes upon the sale of master tek  our discontinued operation 
we were able to carry back the capital loss to the prior three years and partially offset it against capital gains realized during those years 
the remaining million of capital loss was carried forward to future years to offset any future capital gains 
the million tax benefit of the capital loss carryforward was fully offset by a valuation allowance as of december  because management did not believe it is more likely than not we will generate future capital gains prior to the expiration date of the loss carryforward 
during  we were able to utilize a portion of the capital loss carryforward to offset taxable gains on the sale land 
as a result  a portion of the valuation allowance was reversed in equal to the tax benefit realized 
the remaining capital loss carryforward is fully offset by a valuation allowance as of december  because management continues to believe it is more likely than not we will not generate future capital gains sufficient to fully utilize the carryforward prior to the expiration date of the loss carryforward 
the capital loss carryforward expires in cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
the adoption of sfas r required us to change from recognizing the effect of forfeitures as they occur to estimating the number of outstanding instruments for which the requisite service is not expected to be rendered 
as required by sfas r we recorded a million net of tax benefit on january  to reflect the reduction in compensation expense that would have resulted had we been estimating the effect of forfeitures in prior periods

our services group provides contract operations and maintenance services to clients in mississippi and texas  among other states 
hurricanes katrina and rita caused significant damage in the gulf coast region of the united states during the third quarter of the water and wastewater infrastructures for five clients in mississippi were disabled by hurricane katrina 
the contracts with these clients allow us to incur and bill additional expenses during an emergency situation to restore water supply and wastewater treatment services to customers 
in addition  the clients requested our assistance with the removal of debris to enable access for emergency vehicles and residents 
we incurred million of overtime labor costs and emergency out of pocket operating expenses related to these emergency recovery efforts for our clients during which are reflected as direct operating expenses 
we billed our clients million for these emergency services and assisted our clients in requesting reimbursement from the federal emergency management agency fema pursuant to guidelines established in fema s applicant handbook with respect to these costs

direct operating expenses were and of related revenues for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is caused  in part  by lower direct operating expenses at our california utility associated with lower water consumption 
the lower consumption enabled us to reduce the amount of water purchased from outside sources  which is generally at prices higher than the cost of water pumped from our own wells 
services group 
direct operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million during the same period of the increase in direct operating expense was due to the following a million increase resulting from higher levels of contract operations and maintenance work  primarily those performed for our utility group  as well as increased construction work  the increase results from increased staffing  fleet expenses and material costs related to the additional contract work  and a million increase resulting from acquisitions in the latter part of and early  offset by a million decrease in construction work related to a reverse osmosis plant  which has been under construction since and was substantially completed as of december  direct operating expenses as a percentage of the related revenues decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period last year 
a majority of the direct operating expenses for the services group  such as labor and related fringe benefits and service vehicle fleet costs  are fixed in nature 
the high percentage in was due to those fixed costs being absorbed by a lower revenue base 
revenues in were depressed because of higher than normal rainfall which impeded our ability to perform additional construction  operating and maintenance work

new accounting guidance and pronouncements adopted during sab in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
topic n  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying the effects of misstatements in the current year financial statements 
sab requires companies to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet and income statement approach 
companies must then evaluate whether either method results in quantifying an error that is material 
prior to sab  we had used the income statement method for quantifying misstatements in our financial statements 
we were required to initially apply the guidance in sab for the fiscal year ended december  sab permits companies to initially apply its interpretive guidance by either restating prior financial statements or by recording a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings in the year of initial adoption 
we discovered computational errors in the way we were measuring our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
these errors had been occurring annually since the and adoption of two accounting pronouncements which mandated the liability method of accounting for measuring deferred income taxes sfas nos 
and  accounting for income taxes 
the cumulative effect of these errors  which occurred for the most part ratably over a year period  resulted in a million deferred tax liability overstatement through december  the impact of these errors was immaterial to each of the prior years under the income statement approach 
however  in applying the dual method approach under sab  the cumulative effect of correcting the errors is material 
as a result  we elected to record a million adjustment to the retained earnings balance as of january  in accordance with the transition provisions in sab sfas no 
r effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective method 
generally  sfas r is similar in approach to sfas  which we adopted in  and requires that compensation cost relating to share based payments be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
the adoption of sfas r required us to change from recognizing the effect of forfeitures as they occur to estimating the number of outstanding instruments for which the requisite service is not expected to be rendered 
as a result  we recorded a benefit of million million  net of tax on january   which is reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
additionally  sfas no 
r requires that the tax benefit from the tax deduction related to share based compensation that is in excess of recognized compensation costs be reported as a financing cash flow rather than an operating cash flow 
sfas no 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
this statement requires balance sheet recognition of the funded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans 
under sfas  actuarial gains and losses  prior service costs or credits  and any remaining transition assets or obligations that have not been recognized under previous accounting standards must be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax effects  until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost 
in addition  the measurement date the date at which plan assets and the benefit obligation are measured is required to be the same as a company s fiscal year end 
sfas is effective for publicly held companies for fiscal years ending after december   except for the measurement date provisions  which are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have historically used december st as the measurement date for the postretirement benefit plan 
the adoption of sfas reduced total liabilities and increased total stockholders equity by less than million  net of taxes 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements for and we believe it will not have a material effect on our results of operations for and beyond 
recent accounting pronouncements fin no 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement model for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns 
fin requires a company to recognize in its financial statements the impact of a tax position if it is more likely than not more than the position will be sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the provisions of fin are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  if any  recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we expect the adoption of fin will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this statement establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out framework for establishing fair value  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies only to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards and is expected to increase the consistency of those measurements 
adoption of sfas is required for our fiscal year beginning january   and will be applied prospectively under most circumstances 
while we are still evaluating the impact this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements  we currently believe the impact will not be material 
sfas no 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
this statement permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and other specified items at fair value 
this statement is effective for our fiscal year beginning january  and will be applied prospectively 
while we are still evaluating the impact this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements  we currently believe the impact will not be material 
liquidity and capital resources our overall objectives with respect to liquidity and capital resources are to generate sufficient operating cash flows to service our debt and tax obligations  fund capital improvements and organic growth  and pay dividends to our stockholders  utilize our credit facility for major capital improvements and to manage seasonal cash needs  obtain external financing for major acquisitions  and maintain approximately equal levels of debt and equity consistent with the investor owned water utility industry

contributions in aid of construction ciac represent contributions in the form of cash  services or property received from developers  governmental agencies  municipalities or individuals for the purpose of constructing utility plant and is not refundable 
in  we expect to spend approximately million on cash additions  principally within our utility group  and expect to receive million of ciac resulting in total expected additions to property  plant and equipment of approximately million 
we also made substantial investments in acquisitions during and and expect we will continue to do so in the future 
in addition  in december we acquired the minority interest in windermere utility company that we did not already own pursuant to a shareholder agreement we entered into in when we acquired our ownership interest 
pursuant to the agreement  we acquired the interest by issuing  shares of our common stock with an aggregate market value of million to the minority stockholder in exchange for the remaining shares 
because this was a non cash  stock for stock exchange  the transaction is deemed to be a non cash investing and financing activity 
cash flows from financing activities 
during  we financed our growth through a broad range of capital initiatives sold million of first mortgage bonds due in and used the proceeds to repay an million first mortgage bond which matured during  and received million of proceeds from our direct stock purchase plan  our employee stock purchase and option plans and our director option plan 
aggregate borrowings under our revolving lines of credit increased by a net million during compared to primarily due to our acquisition activities and to fund our capital expenditure programs 
our borrowing availability under our credit facility was million as of december  during  we paid of cash dividends to our common and preferred stockholders

the terms of the long term debt are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the bank lines of credit bear interest at variable rates and therefore the amount of future interest payments are uncertain 
borrowings bear interest  at our option  based on a margin either a over the libor rate  or b under the prime rate 
the margins vary based on our consolidated debt to equity ratio 
the weighted average interest rate on our bank line of credit borrowings was as of december  interest on the mortgage bonds is fixed at a weighted average annual interest rate of and is payable semiannually 
interest on the bank term loans is fixed at a weighted average annual interest rate of and is payable semiannually 
interest on the convertible debentures is fixed at a annual rate and is payable quarterly 
the debentures are convertible  at the option of the holder  into shares of our common stock at any time prior to their maturity 
interest on the economic development bonds is fixed at a weighted average annual interest rate of and is payable semiannually

excludes preferred stock dividend obligations 
preferred stockholders are entitled to receive annual dividends of per share and there are  shares of preferred stock outstanding as of december  the preferred stock is redeemable by the company at any time for per share and  from time to time  we have elected to repurchase shares offered to us by preferred stockholders at prices less than per share 
financial condition and liquidity as of december   we had million of working capital and million of operating lease obligations payable during as of december   we also had million of additional borrowings available under our line of credit facility  which expires on april  in addition to our line of credit  our california and new mexico mortgage bond indentures permit the issuance of an additional million of first mortgage bonds as of december  however  the terms of our credit facility do not permit additional first mortgage bond indebtedness without prior consent from the credit facility lenders 
the mortgage bond indentures also limit the amount of cash and property dividends our california and new mexico utilities may pay to the parent company to fund its payment obligations 
dividends have averaged to million per year and are less than the aggregate cumulative dividend restriction threshold by million as of december  we were in compliance with all loan agreement covenants during the year ended december  we also have on file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  which is effective for the issuance of up to million aggregate principal amount of common stock  debt securities and warrants 
to date we have issued approximately million of common stock under the shelf registration  and about million remains available for issuance as of december  we may offer any of these securities for sale at any time and from time to time 
we believe that our expected operating cash flows  together with borrowings under our credit facility million of which was available as of december  and expires on april  will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  working capital and capital expenditure requirements as well as our debt service and other contractual obligations for the next twelve months 
however  our ability to comply with debt financial covenants  pay principal or interest and refinance our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance as well as competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control 
certain contractual commitments and indemnities in  we were retained to facilitate the engineering and construction of a million reverse osmosis water treatment plant in the city of san juan capistrano  california for the capistrano valley water district cvwd 
in  we obtained a million standby letter of credit as collateral to insure our performance during the design and construction of the water treatment plant 
construction was completed during and we are working with the cvwd to obtain its final acceptance of the project 
upon final acceptance of the project by the cvwd  which we expect to receive in  the standby letter of credit will be terminated 
we now operate the completed plant under a twenty year operating agreement 
the cvwd service contract contains three guarantees related to our performance during the term of the operating agreement 
the agreement provides for liquidated damages in the event we fail to perform for reasons other than those caused by uncontrollable circumstances  as such term is defined in the agreement 
during the term of the operating agreement  we may be liable for liquidated damages relating to any lost payments from a financial assistance agreement cvwd has with a state water agency  up to a maximum of million per contract year 
we have also made guarantees to cvwd with respect to the quantity of finished water produced by the facility 
in the event the actual number of acre feet of finished water delivered is less than the water delivery guarantee  we are required to pay liquidated damages of approximately per acre foot of shortfall  up a maximum of acre feet per day 
finally  we have made guarantees with respect to seven measurable finished water quality standards 
liquidated damages for failure to meet these quality standards range from to per day per failed quality standard up to a maximum of  per day  depending on the number of violations per contract year 
the cvwd has not asserted any claims for liquidated damages pursuant to these guarantees through the date of this report 
as part of the financing for this project  the cvwd sold insured municipal bonds 
we entered into an agreement with the bond insurer to guarantee our performance under the service contract  subject to certain liability caps to the bond insurer in the event of a default 
during the twenty year operation of the facility  such liability caps will not exceed an amount equal to million plus an amount no greater than the replacement cost of the actual reverse osmosis filtration unit within the facility  estimated to be approximately million 
as of december   we had irrevocable standby letters of credit in the amount of million issued and outstanding under our credit facility  including the cvwd letter of credit described above 
during our normal course of business  we have entered into agreements containing indemnities pursuant to which we may be required to make payments in the future 
these indemnities are in connection with facility leases and liabilities and operations and maintenance and construction contracts entered into by our services group 
the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies  and in certain cases  is indefinite 
substantially all of these indemnities provide no limitation on the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make and is not quantifiable 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities 
in connection with the sale of master tek  we made indemnities to the buyer with respect to a number of customary  and certain other specific  representations and warranties 
our indemnities with respect to these matters are limited in terms of duration to periods ranging from one year to the expiration of the applicable statue of limitations 
off balance sheet arrangements through the date of this report  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our subsidiaries 
we lease some of our equipment and office facilities under operating leases which are deemed to be off balance sheet arrangements 
our future operating lease payment obligations are more fully described under the caption contractual obligations above 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates and judgments are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments are made and they are evaluated and updated on an ongoing basis 
to the extent our estimates and judgments are different than actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we believe the following are the more critical accounting policies we use in preparing our financial statements and are important to fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial position and results of operations 
accounting for regulated businesses our regulated businesses  which include our utilities in california  new mexico and texas  are accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas  which specifies certain revenue  expense and balance sheet treatment as required by each state s regulatory authority 
each state authority establishes rates which are intended to permit each utility to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return 
our services group provides construction  operations and maintenance services to our utilities in alabama  new mexico and texas and recognizes a profit on those services 
in accordance with sfas  we do not eliminate the services group s profit recognized on these services because management believes the sales price is reasonable and it is probable that  through the rate making process  future utility group revenue approximately equal to the sales price will result from the regulated utilities use of the services 
we do  however  eliminate revenues to the extent of the related costs in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the guidance provided in sfas since the regulators that govern our utilities have historically approved the services provided and rates charged by our services group to our utilities as a component of rates  we believe we have met the requirements of sfas to recognize profit on such services 
during the years ended december   and  we have recognized profit of million  million and million  respectively 
over the years  the cpuc  the regulator of suburban  our california utility  has had various policies with respect to accounting for the difference between suburban s actual water production costs incurred and cpuc adopted water production costs 
in the water industry  those costs consist of expenditures for purchased water  purchased power and pump taxes 
at times  the cpuc has allowed balancing accounts in the financial statements of water utilities whereby the difference between actual and cpuc adopted costs are recorded as either a receivable  for under collections of costs from customers  or as a liability  for over collections of costs from customers  as permitted by sfas under these procedures  the utility would apply for the dispensation of balancing accounts and amounts would either be refunded to or recovered from utility customers through future cpuc authorized rate adjustments  once certain balancing thresholds were achieved 
prior to november   the cpuc allowed the recording of the difference between actual costs incurred and the cpuc adopted volume related costs to balancing accounts 
the cpuc changed their methodology in and required an earnings test to accompany annual submissions of memorandum accounts where these volume related differences would be tracked 
once submitted to the cpuc  the utility would subsequently be directed by the cpuc as to what portion of their memorandum account could be added to or subtracted from its balancing account 
as a result of this change and the uncertainties the earnings test created with respect to the collections of under collections  suburban elected to record in its financial statements only over collections of volume related costs until recovery of under collections was assured 
suburban followed this practice from december until april in april  the cpuc issued a decision which eliminated the required earnings test  removing the uncertainty associated with the recovering balancing account under collections 
as a result  in we recorded million of receivables related to balancing account under collections attributable to and million attributable to that are now reasonably assured of recovery from customers 
these amounts are included in other long term assets as of december  future cpuc policy changes could have an impact on recording under collections in future periods 
revenue recognition water utility revenues are recognized when water is delivered to customers 
at the end of an accounting period  estimated amounts for unbilled revenues are accrued for water usage since the previous billing period 
revenues for contract operations are recognized and billed at the end of the month based on a monthly fee to provide a specific level of service as outlined in each individual contract 
we generally bill for additional services provided beyond the scope of the base contract on a time and materials basis as such services are rendered 
revenues for construction projects for unaffiliated third parties are recorded using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method recognizes revenue and income as work progresses on a project based on the expected total project costs and the expected total project revenues 
we estimate the percentage of completion using total contract price  actual costs incurred to date and an estimate of the completion costs for each contract 
revenues for construction projects for utilities within our utility group are recorded using the completed contract method of accounting under which all revenues and costs are recognized upon completion of the project 
if management anticipates we will ultimately suffer a loss on a construction project  the entire estimated loss is recorded in the period such a determination is made 
for contracts involving the provision of a single product or service single element contracts  revenue is generally recognized when the product or service is provided and the amount becomes billable 
if services are provided evenly during the contract term but service billings are irregular  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
for contracts involving the provision of multiple products or services elements  total estimated contract revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each service in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
certain non refundable activation fees in our non regulated wholesale water operations are recognized over the expected period of performance 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we assess intangible assets and other long lived assets  excluding goodwill  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets or other long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure impairment by using the projected discounted cash flow method in accordance with sfas net long lived assets and intangible assets  excluding goodwill  amounted to million as of december  goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually  on october st of each year  or when events or circumstances indicate carrying values may not be recoverable 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment using discounted cash flow methodologies  transaction values for comparable companies  and other valuation techniques for all of our reporting units with goodwill balances  we do not have any indefinite lived intangible assets 
we recorded million of goodwill impairment charges during the second and third quarters of as a result of a review of the business strategy for our water and wastewater testing laboratory reporting unit 
there were no additional impairment charges resulting from the october  impairment testing of all reporting units and no events have occurred subsequent to that date which indicates impairment may have occurred 
goodwill with an aggregate book value of million remains as of december  and will be subject to impairment testing on october   or sooner  if additional events occur or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible further impairment may exist 
stock based compensation we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of our stock options 
this option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that do not have vesting restrictions and that are fully transferable 
option valuation models require subjective assumptions such as the expected future volatility of the stock price 
because the stock options we grant have characteristics that are significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the calculated results  in management s opinion  the stock option valuation models  including black scholes  may not necessarily provide an exact measure of the fair value of employee stock options 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized stock compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively  using the black scholes option valuation model 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had million of long term variable and fixed rate debt 
we are exposed to market risk based on changes in prevailing interest rates 
market risk related to our variable rate debt is estimated as the potential decrease in pre tax earnings resulting from an increase in interest rates 
we have million of long term debt that bears interest at variable rates based on either the prime rate or libor rate 
our variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of as of december  a hypothetical one percent basis points increase in the average interest rates charged on our variable rate debt would reduce our pre tax earnings by approximately million per year 
our fixed rate debt  which has a carrying value of million  has a fair value of million as of december  market risk related to our fixed rate debt is deemed to be the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in prevailing interest rates 
our fixed rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of as of december  a hypothetical ten percent decrease in interest rates  from to  would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce these risks although we may do so in the future 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
