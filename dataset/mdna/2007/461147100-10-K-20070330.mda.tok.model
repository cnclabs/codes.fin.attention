item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business and results of operations are substantially dependent upon the demand for ate by semiconductor manufacturers and companies that specialize in the testing of ics 
demand for ate is driven by semiconductor manufacturers that are opening new  or expanding existing  semiconductor fabrication facilities or upgrading existing equipment  which in turn is dependent upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
in the past  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply  which often have a severe impact on the semiconductor industry s demand for ate  including the products we manufacture 
this can cause wide fluctuations in both our orders and net revenues and  depending on our ability to react quickly to these shifts in demand  can significantly impact our results of operations 
these industry cycles are difficult to predict 
because the industry cycles are generally characterized by sequential quart erly growth or declines in orders and net revenues throughout the cycle  year over year comparisons of operating results may not always be as meaningful as comparisons of periods at similar points in either up or down cycles 
in addition  during both downward and upward cycles in our industry  while the general trend over several quarters tends to be one of either growth or decline  in any given quarter  the trend in both our orders and net revenues can be erratic 
this can occur  for example  when orders are canceled or currently scheduled delivery dates are accelerated or postponed by a significant customer or when customer forecasts and general business conditions fluctuate during a quarter 
we believe that purchases of most of our products are typically made from semiconductor manufacturers capital expenditure budgets 
certain portions of our business  however  are generally less dependent upon the capital expenditure budgets of the end users 
for example  purchases of certain related ate interface products  such as sockets and interface boards  which must be replaced periodically  are typically made from the end users operating budgets 
in addition  purchases of certain of our products  such as docking hardware  for the purpose of upgrading or improving the utilization  performance and efficiency of existing ate  tend to be counter cyclical to sales of new ate 
moreover  we believe a portion of our sales of temperature management systems results from the increasing need for temperature testing of circuit boards and specialized components that do not have the design or quantity to be tested in an electronic device handler 
in addition  in recent years we have begun to market our temperature m anagement systems in industries outside semiconductor test  such as the automotive  aerospace  medical and telecommunications industries 
we believe that these industries usually are less cyclical than the ate industry 
net revenues and orders the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a breakdown of the net revenues from unaffiliated customers both by product segment and geographic area based on the location of the selling entity 
years ended december  net revenues from unaffiliated customers manipulator docking hardware temperature management tester interface intersegment sales intersegment sales manipulator docking hardware temperature management tester interface us europe asia pacific intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our consolidated net revenues for the year ended december  increased million or as compared to during  our consolidated net revenues peaked during the second quarter of the year when they totaled million 
during both the third and fourth quarters of  our quarterly consolidated net revenues declined with net revenues during the third quarter totaling million  and net revenues in the fourth quarter totaling million 
we attribute the strength in the second quarter of in part to the fact that we had several customers place large orders which were booked and shipped during the second quarter 
in addition  we believe the industry up cycle peaked during the second quarter of the subsequent declines we experienced during the balance of the year in the levels of both our orders and net revenues were more significant in our manipulator docking hardware and tester interface product segments than for our temperature management segment where we have continu ed to experience increased success in selling these products in markets which we believe to be less cyclical than the semiconductor test industry 
partially offsetting the decline in net revenues within our manipulator docking hardware product segment during the second half of was continued strong demand for certain third party products we distribute through our operation in japan  which is included in this segment 
total orders for the year ended december  increased to million on a consolidated basis as compared to million for for our manipulator docking hardware  temperature management and tester interface product segments  total orders for were million  million and million  respectively compared to million  million and million  respectively  for similar to the trend in our net revenues  the second quarter of represented the peak for our orders during the year with total orders of million on a consolidated basis 
for the third and fourth quarters of  our orders declined to million and million  respectively 
we believe the decline in our orders during the second half of indicates that we are in the down portion of this business cycle 
we cannot be certain what the level of our orders or net revenues will be in any future period 
backlog at december   our backlog of unfilled orders for all products was approximately million compared with approximately million at december  our backlog includes customer orders which we have accepted  substantially all of which we expect to deliver in while backlog is calculated on the basis of firm purchase orders  a customer may cancel an order or accelerate or postpone currently scheduled delivery dates 
our backlog may be affected by the tendency of customers to rely on short lead times available from suppliers  including us  in periods of depressed demand 
in periods of increased demand  there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog 
as a result  our backlog at a particular date is not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period 
cost containment and organizational changes in response to the cyclical nature of the ate market in which we operate  we have taken various actions to restructure our operations in recent years 
the goal of these actions was to significantly reduce our fixed operating costs and position ourselves to more effectively meet the needs and expectations of the cyclical ate market 
the most recent actions during late and included organizational changes which allowed us to eliminate certain central corporate staff as well as workforce reductions and facility closures which allowed us to eliminate excess manufacturing capacity at certain of our locations 
in addition  during periods of significant weakened demand  such as in late  we also implemented headcount reductions and salary and benefit adjustments as temporary cost saving measures which we have reinstated as warranted by increases in our sales levels and profitability 
this includes the restoration on april   of the salaries for certain staff in our manipulator docking hardware product segment which had been reduced in late in addition  on july   we reinstated our employer k matching contribution and increased salaries for most of our domestic staff  the majority of whom had not had salary increases in two years 
total k employer match expense incurred in was  additional information regarding the various restructuring plans implemented in recent years  including the costs incurred  is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the only restructuring plan which was not completed was the closure of our uk manufacturing operation 
we announced the closure of this operation in mid march and ceased manufacturing operations at this facility during the second quarter of in november  we entered into an agreement to sub lease the facility where this operation had been located 
during the fourth quarter of  we finalized this sub leasing arrangement 
as of december   there are no accruals remaining related to the closure of this operation as all aspects of the closure are now complete 
as intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued a part of the sub lease agreement  however  we remain obligated for the lease payments in the event the sub lessee defaults 
this guaranty obligation is more fully discussed below in the liquidity and capital resources section 
our uk operation is included in our manipulator docking hardware segment 
we believe the actions taken in recent years to reorganize and decentralize our operations have made us a more competitive company and have positioned us to adapt more quickly to new market challenges and opportunities through continued research and development as well as strategic merger and acquisition activities 
as part of our continuing focus to determine methods to increase our profitability worldwide while operating in the cyclical ate market  we intend to continue reviewing and evaluating actions that could better match our operating costs against our anticipated future revenue and product demand as we pursue additional growth opportunities 
excess and obsolete inventory charges on a quarterly basis  we review our inventories and record charges for excess and obsolete inventory based upon our established objective excess and obsolete inventory criteria 
these criteria identify material that has not been used in a work order during the prior twelve months and the quantity of material on hand that is greater than the average annual usage of that material over the prior three years 
in certain cases  additional excess and obsolete inventory charges are recorded based upon current industry conditions  anticipated product life cycles  new product introductions and expected future use of the inventory 
the excess and obsolete inventory charges we record establish a new cost basis for the related inventory 
see also the section entitled critical accounting policies 
we incurred charges for excess and obsolete inventory of  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the level of these charges was based upon a variety of factors  including changes in demand for our products and new product designs 
the downward trend in our excess and obsolete inventory charges has been driven by a number of factors  including the stronger demand for our products during the recent up cycle as well as more efficient inventory management 
the charges for included approximately  related to the remaining inventory located at our uk manufacturing operation which was closed as of june   as previously discussed 
the higher level of inventory obsolescence charges during was primarily the result of customer order cancellations after we had already purchased inventory to fulfill the orders and where that inventory could not be used in other products we manufacture due to its highly customized nature 
in addi tion during  we had increases in our reserves for excess quantities related to materials that were purchased based upon forecasted orders which did not materialize 
during the fourth quarter of  management made the determination to curtail the practice of purchasing significant amounts of inventory against forecasted orders due to the increased level of uncertainty in our current business outlook 
however  in the future  we may determine that it is appropriate to increase the level of such purchases based on a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  general market conditions and the specific delivery requirements of our customers 
see also the section entitled critical accounting policies 
during the years ended december   and we utilized   and  respectively  of material in production that had been written off as obsolete in prior periods 
when previously written off inventory material is used in production  it has a zero cost basis and as a result  has the impact of improving our gross margin in the period used 
for the years ended december   and  the use of previously obsoleted inventory materials did not materially change our gross margin 
product warranty charges we accrue product warranty charges quarterly  based upon our historical claims experience 
in addition  from time to time  we accrue additional amounts based upon known product warranty issues  such as product retrofits 
for the years ended december   and  our product warranty charges were   and million  or  and of net revenues  respectively 
the downward trend in our product warranty charges has been driven by a number of factors including recent improvements in product quality as well as the fact that there were no introductions of new product families in and in our manipulator docking hardware segment 
the higher levels of product warranty charges in were the result of specific product retrofits and other costs associated with several products we sold to certain ate manufacturers 
there were no similar known product retrofit warranty issues for which we needed to record additional specific product warranty accruals in or intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the level of our product warranty charges both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues is affected by a number of factors including the cyclicality of demand in the ate industry  the prototype nature of much of our business  the complex nature of many of our products  the introduction of new product families which typically have higher levels of warranty claims than existing product families  and  at our discretion  providing warranty repairs or replacements to customers after the contracted warranty period has expired in order to promote strong customer relations 
see also critical accounting policies 
product customer mix our three product segments each have multiple products that we design  manufacture and sell to our customers 
the gross margin on each product we offer is impacted by a number of factors including the amount of intellectual property such as patents utilized in the product  the number of units ordered by the customer at one time  or the amount of intest designed and fabricated material included in our product compared with the amount of third party designed and fabricated material included in our product 
the weight of each of these factors  as well as the current market conditions  determines the ultimate sales price we can obtain for our products and the resulting gross margin 
the mix of products we sell in any period is ultimately determined by our customers needs 
therefore  the mix of products sold in any given period can change significantly from the prior period 
as a result  our consolidated gross margin can be significantly impacted in any given period by a change in the mix of products sold in that period 
we sell our products to both semiconductor manufacturers end user sales and to ate manufacturers oem sales who ultimately resell our equipment with theirs to semiconductor manufacturers 
the mix of customers during any given period will affect our gross margin due to differing sales discounts and commissions 
for the years ended december   and  our oem sales as a percentage of net revenues were  and  respectively 
the impact of an increase in oem sales as a percentage of net revenues is generally a reduction in our gross margin  as oem sales historically have had a more significant discount than end user sales 
our current net operating margins on most oem sales for these product segments  however  are only slightly less than margins on end user sales because of the payment of third party sales commissions on most end user sales 
we also expect to continue to experience demands from our oem customers supply line managers to reduce our sales prices to them 
this continued price pressure may have the ultimate effect of reducing our gross and operating margins if we cannot further reduce our manufacturing and operating costs 
risk factors please see item a risk factors for a discussion of other important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from our prior results or those expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
results of operations all of our products are used by semiconductor manufacturers in conjunction with ate in the testing of ics 
consequently  the results of operations for each product segment are generally affected by the same factors 
separate discussions and analyses for each product segment would be repetitive and obscure any unique factors that affected the results of operations of our different product segments 
the discussion and analysis that follows  therefore  is presented on a consolidated basis for the company as a whole and includes discussion of factors unique to each product segment where significant to an understanding of each segment 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the principal items included in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total net revenues 
intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued percentage of net revenues years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin selling expense engineering and product development expense general and administrative expense restructuring and other charges operating income loss other income loss earnings loss before income taxes income tax expense net earnings loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
we believe the increase in our net revenues reflects the aforementioned higher level of demand experienced in  particularly in the second quarter of the year  compared to weaker cyclical demand during most of during  the net revenues net of intersegment sales of our manipulator docking hardware  temperature management and tester interface product segments increased  and  respectively  as compared to we attribute the larger percentage increase in our manipulator docking hardware product segment to the aforementioned strong demand for certain third party products in japan 
we attribute the lower percentage increase in the net revenues of our tester interface segment to continued strong competition within this market as well as a more significant slowdown in the business of several of the major customers of this segment 
during  our net revenues from customers in the us and asia increased and  respectively  while our net revenues from customers in europe declined over the comparable period in as previously mentioned  during  we closed our uk manufacturing operation 
when adjusted to exclude the sales of our uk operation in  net revenues from customers in europe increased during as compared to the smaller percentage increase for our european customers reflects the fact that sales of temperature management products represent a higher percentage of our total european sales than of our domestic sales  and  as previously discussed  sales of our temperature management products have not been as significantly impacted by the changes in demand in the semiconductor industry 
in addition  the lower percentage increase in sales to european customers can also be attributed to the fact that the sales of our intestlogic operation in southern germany increased only in as compared t o sales of this subsidiary have also been less impacted by the changes in demand within the industry  decreasing only in as compared to we believe this reflects strong customer acceptance of the products manufactured by this subsidiary 
the higher percentage increase for our customers in asia primarily reflects an increase in sales of third party products by our japanese subsidiary as well as increases in sales of temperature management products by our subsidiary in singapore 
in addition  some of the sales which would have historically been generated by our uk manufacturing operation were shifted to the operation in singapore during gross margin 
gross margin was for as compared to for the increase in gross margin was primarily the result of a reduction in our fixed operating costs both in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of net revenues 
to a lesser extent  we also had a reduction in charges for excess and obsolete inventory in as compared to in absolute dollar terms  our fixed operating costs decreased  during as compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower depreciation expense as a result of our lower fixed asset base as of december  compared to december  in addition  there was also a decrease in our insurance premiums which was a result of several factors including the lower fixed asset base  lower total average headcount for certain operations and the closure of our uk manufacturing operation 
the decrease in our fixed operating costs in absolute dollar terms combined with the higher net revenue levels in as compared intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued to led to the overall decrease in fixed operating costs as a percentage of net revenues from in to in our excess and obsolete inventory charges totaled  or less than of net revenues  for as compared to million  or of net revenues  for we attribute the reduction in excess and obsolete inventory charges primarily to our continued efforts to more closely manage our inventory levels and purchasing policies to minimize our risk in this area 
selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of  or less than 
during  there were increases in travel costs  fees paid to third parties for installation of our products at customer sites  primarily in asia  and sales commissions 
the increase in travel costs primarily reflects more overseas trips to visit various customers in asia and europe 
the increase in installation costs primarily represents instances where our internal sales people were not available to perform an installation at a customer site 
in these situations  our practice is to hire a third party to perform the installation for us 
as our overseas business has grown  we have experienced more instances where we do not have internal sales personnel readily available to perform installations overseas 
the increase in sales commissions reflects the increase in the level of sales during as compared to these increases were offset primarily by decreases in e xpenditures related to certain limited duration marketing programs that were in place in early in our temperature management product segment  lower levels of product warranty expense  and a reduction in expenditures for demonstration equipment in as compared to engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of  or 
we attribute the decrease primarily to the receipt of reimbursement payments totaling  during the first half of for engineering services under a contract with one of the customers of our tester interface product segment 
under this contract we received payments based on achieving various milestones as defined in the contract related to specified product redesign activities 
this contract ended during the second quarter of  and no further payments will be received 
in addition  expenditures for third party consultants decreased during as compared to these third party consultants had been retained to assist in new product development efforts during for our tester interface product segment 
these decreases were offset primarily by higher salary and benefits expense and increased spending on r esearch and development materials during as compared to the increase in salary and benefits expense was due to hiring additional staff at our tester interface and temperature management product segments as well as the restoration of certain salaries and benefits 
the increase in staff at our tester interface product segment primarily related to the engineering services contract previously discussed 
when this contract ended  certain staff members were either terminated or  in some cases  re assigned to other projects 
the increase in spending on research and development materials was related to various new product development projects primarily in our temperature management and manipulator docking hardware product segments 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily driven by an increase in salary and benefits expense which reflects the restoration of certain salaries and benefits in april and july  as previously mentioned  as well as the hiring of some additional staff 
to a lesser extent  we incurred additional professional fees related to audit  tax and other compliance work where we utilize the assistance of third party professionals 
the increase in these fees primarily reflects the growing number and complexity of the various accounting and other compliance matters that we encounter in the normal course of running our business 
finally  the amount of performance based bonuses we accrued in increased as compared to which reflects our positive results for restructuring and other charges 
restructuring and other charges were  for compared to  for  a decrease of  the restructuring and other charges recorded during related to finalizing the sub lease agreement for the facility where our uk manufacturing operation was located prior to its closure in mid the restructuring and other charges recorded during consisted of  in severance and related costs and  in lease termination costs resulting from the closure of this same operation 
in addition  we incurred  in severance and related costs associated with a workforce reduction at our facility in san jose  california in other income 
other income was  for compared to  for  an increase of  the increase primarily reflects higher interest income  which was the result of both higher average cash balances and an increase in the rate of return earned on such balances  combined with a reduction in foreign exchange transaction losses 
the reduction in foreign exchange transaction losses was primarily the result of a  foreign currency translation adjustment related to the final dissolution of our uk operation which was completed during the fourth quarter of intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued income tax expense 
for  we recorded income tax expense of million compared to  for our effective tax rate was for compared to for the increase in our effective tax rate during as compared to reflects that a higher proportion of our taxable income for was generated by certain of our foreign operations where we do not have a history of operating losses and therefore do not have net operating loss carryforwards to offset income tax expense on those earnings 
in addition  during we recorded an income tax benefit related to a domestic income tax refund we received during the year 
due to our history of operating losses in our other operations  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against all domestic and certain foreign deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  where we believe it is more likely than not that we will not have sufficient taxable income to utilize these assets before they expire 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million for compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
late in the third quarter of  we began to see a decline in demand  and we believe the decrease in our net revenues for reflects the weaker cyclical demand during as compared to most of for  the net revenues net of intersegment sales of our manipulator docking hardware  temperature management and tester interface segments decreased million or  million or and million or  respectively  over the comparable period in we believe the larger percentage decreases in our manipulator docking hardware and tester interface segments reflect the decreased production requirements of our customers during  and that the smaller percentage decrease in the sales of our temperature management segment reflects the fact that these products are used in less cyclical non production environments  such as research and development laborator ies  as well as in industries outside of semiconductor test 
the larger percentage decline in the net revenues of our tester interface segment also reflects increased competition during this led to significant downward pressure on pricing and  in some cases  we chose not to bid on business rather than sell at prices where we would not be assured of positive margins 
instead  this segment focused on new product development areas during during  our net revenues from customers in the us and europe decreased and  respectively  and our net revenues from customers in asia increased over the comparable period in the smaller percentage decline for our european customers reflects the fact that sales of temperature management products represent a higher percentage of our total european sales than they do of our domestic sales  and  as previously discussed  sales of our temperature management products have not been as significantly impacted by the weakened demand in the industry 
in addition  the lower percentage decline in sales to european customers can also be attributed to the fact that the sales of our intestlogic operation in southern germany decreased only in as compared to we believe this reflects strong customer acceptance of the products manufactured by this subsidiary 
the increase for our customers in asia primarily reflects an increase in sales of third party products by our japanese subsidiary in as compared to gross margin 
gross margin was for as compared to for the decline in gross margin was primarily the result of our fixed operating costs not being as fully absorbed in due to the significantly lower net revenue levels as compared to as a percentage of net revenues  our fixed operating costs were and for and  respectively 
in absolute dollar terms  our fixed operating costs decreased million during as compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower salary and benefits expense as a result of the cost containment initiatives we put into place during late and early this decrease was partially offset by a reduction in the utilization rates of our internal machine shop operations in both our cherry hill  new jersey and our san jose  california facilities  as well as an increase in our insurance premiums 
our component material costs were for as compared to for the comparable period in we attribute the increase in component material costs primarily to product mix 
our excess and obsolete inventory charges totaled million  or of net revenues  for as compared to million  or of net revenues  for finally  although the absolute dollar value of direct labor decreased by  for as compared to  as a percentage of net revenues  direct labor remained consistent at for both years due to the significantly lower net revenue levels in as compared to we attribute the decrease in the absolute dollar value of direct labor to the aforementioned cost containment initiatives 
selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
we attribute the decrease primarily to a million decrease in product warranty costs as well as lower levels of commission expense 
the decrease in product warranty costs is due in part to the fact that our warranty costs in included  in charges related to product retrofits and other costs associated with several products we sold to three ate intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued manufacturers 
in addition  during the third quarter of  we recorded charges of approximately  as a result of negative trends in our historical claims experience 
there were no similar charges in commission expense decreased  primarily due to the significantly lower net revenue levels 
to a lesser extent  decreases in salary and benefits expense  travel expenses  freight and advertising also contributed to the decreased selling expense 
the decreases in these expense categories reflect both the aforementioned cost containment initiatives as well as decreased business activity 
these decreases were offset somewhat by an increase in marketing costs for our temperature management product segment for a specific program we implemented in related to our mm technology 
engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of  or 
we attribute the decrease primarily to an  reduction in salary and benefits expense 
this reduction was primarily the result of the aforementioned cost containment initiatives 
to a lesser extent there were also decreases in spending on travel and supplies 
these decreases were partially offset by a  increase in the use of third party consultants  primarily by our tester interface product segment related to specific product development projects 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million in each of and there were decreases in travel and information technology costs during as compared to the same period in  which were offset by higher levels of incentive compensation expense related to grants of restricted stock 
during  we implemented a new company wide enterprise resource planning system 
the implementation process required significant additional travel and use of third party consultants to complete 
the system implementation was completed in  therefore  no charges associated with this process were recorded in in  we began granting restricted stock awards as a form of incentive compensation for certain members of management and directors 
the value of the shares granted is expensed over the four year vesting period 
the level of expense in was significantly lower than in since the first grant of restricted stock was not made until the fourth quar ter of restructuring and other charges 
restructuring and other charges were  for compared to  for  a decrease of  or 
as previously discussed  the restructuring and other charges recorded during consisted of  in severance and related costs and  in lease termination costs resulting from the closure of our uk manufacturing operation 
in addition  we incurred  in severance and related costs associated with a workforce reduction at our facility in san jose  california 
the restructuring and other charges in consisted of severance costs of approximately  related to the reorganization of our domestic operations and long lived asset impairments of  related to our uk facility 
other income expense 
other income was  for compared to other expense of  for  an increase of  the increase reflects higher interest income due primarily to the receipt of  in interest related to a domestic income tax refund we received during combined with an  decrease in foreign exchange transaction losses during as compared to income tax expense 
income tax expense was  for compared to  for our effective tax rate for was compared to in our income tax expense recorded during included a  tax benefit related to domestic income tax refunds we received during the second and third quarters of the year 
this amount was offset by foreign income tax expense we recorded on the earnings of certain of our foreign operations where we do not have net operating loss carryforwards to offset income tax expense on those earnings 
the income tax expense recorded during represents foreign income tax expense on the earnings of these same operations 
we increased our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets by  and  in and  respectively  due to taxable losses experienced in our domestic and certain foreign operations and the uncertainty surrounding whether we would be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize these net oper ating loss carryforwards before they expire 
intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was million compared to  in bringing our cash and cash equivalents to million at december  the increase in cash provided by operations in was primarily the result of million of net income generated in compared to a million net loss in although net revenues for increased million or for the year as compared to  accounts receivable decreased  at december  compared to december  this reflects the aforementioned slowdown in business activity in the second half of we had no significant change in the level of inventory on hand at december  compared to december   which we attribute both to the slowdown in business activity in late as well as stronger inventory management practices 
accounts payable increased  from december  to december  primarily due to the timing of payments for purchases made dur ing the fourth quarter of in our temperature management product segment and in our japanese subsidiary 
accrued wages and benefits increased  as the result of increases in vacation accruals  performance based bonus accruals and payroll withholdings related to the domestic k plan 
refundable domestic and foreign income taxes increased  from december  to december  as a result of accruing income taxes on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where we do not have net operating loss carryforwards to offset this expense  as previously discussed 
purchases of machinery and equipment were  for the year ended december   consisting of  primarily for computer hardware  software and quality assurance equipment for our three domestic operations   for demonstration equipment for our temperature management and tester interface divisions and  for additional leasehold improvements primarily for our tester interface facility in san jose  california 
the balance was primarily for machinery and equipment for our foreign locations 
we have no commitments for capital expenditures in  however  depending upon changes in market demand  we will make such purchases as we deem necessary or appropriate 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  which represented  of proceeds from stock options exercised and payments made under capital lease obligations of  our total committed contracts that will affect cash over the next five years and beyond are as follows expected cash payments by year in thousands contractual commitments beyond total capital lease obligations operating lease obligations letters of credit the amounts above do not include minimum purchase requirements related to an exclusive rights agreement to market and sell certain products which are the proprietary and confidential designs of one of the suppliers of our tester interface product segment 
the total minimum purchase requirements per the terms of the agreement for the forty eight month period beginning april  are approximately million 
during  we did not meet the minimum annual purchase requirements and we do not expect to meet the minimum annual purchase requirements in the future 
there is no financial liability for not meeting these purchase requirements  however  the supplier has the right to terminate our exclusive right to market and sell the products covered by the agreement 
we are not currently using these products in any of the products we sell  although we are still exploring potential uses for them in new product designs 
as of december   we have not been notified by the supplier of any inte ntion to terminate the agreement 
intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in connection with the closure of our u 
k manufacturing operation  we have entered into a sub leasing arrangement for the facility which was occupied by this operation prior to its closure 
as a condition of the sub lease  the landlord of this facility has required that we guarantee the performance of the sub lessee with respect to the lease payments 
we have performed a credit analysis of the sub lessee and believe that a default by them with regard to their obligations under the sub lease agreement is remote 
however  as of december   there was approximately  of future payments that we would be obligated to make if the sub lessee were to default and we were unable to enter into a new sub lease agreement with another party 
our original lease on this facility extends through december  as of december  we have not recorded any amounts in our financial statements related to this guarantee 
we have a secured credit facility that provides for maximum borrowings of  we have not utilized this facility to borrow any funds 
our usage consists of the issuance of letters of credit in the face amount of  we pay a quarterly fee of per annum on the total amount of the outstanding letters of credit 
the terms of the loan agreement require that we maintain a minimum level of  of domestic cash 
this credit facility expires on september  we believe that our existing cash balances plus the anticipated cash to be provided from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
as previously discussed  we believe we have entered another cyclical downturn in our industry and have experienced a decline in our orders and sales activity in the second half of we cannot be certain how long this downturn will last or what the rate of increases or decreases in our quarterly net revenues and bookings will be in any future period 
as a result  we may require additional debt or equity financing to meet working capital or capital expenditure needs 
we cannot be certain that  if needed  we would be able to raise such additional financing or upon what terms such financing would be available 
new or recently adopted accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and impact of new or recently adopted accounting standards 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  long lived assets  goodwill  identifiable intangibles  deferred income tax valuation allowances and product warranty reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of these accounting estimates and assumptions are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ ma rkedly from what had been assumed when the financial statements were prepared 
inventory valuation inventory is valued at standard cost  which approximates actual cost computed on a first in  first out basis  not in excess of market value 
on a quarterly basis  we review our inventories and record excess and obsolete inventory charges based upon our established objective excess and obsolete inventory criteria 
these criteria identify material that has not been used in a work order during the prior twelve months and the quantity of material on hand that is greater than the average annual usage of that material over the prior three years 
in certain cases  additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based upon current industry conditions  anticipated product life cycles  new product introductions and expected future use of the inventory 
the charges for excess and obsolete inventory that we record establish a new cost basis for the related inventory 
in  we recorded an inventory obsolescence charge for excess and obsolete inventory of intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued long lived asset valuation we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could indicate impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and or long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we prepare projections of operations for our product segments where these intangibles and or long lived assets are associated 
if the carrying value of the intangible assets and or long lived assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows per the projections  then we would record an impairment charge 
we measure the impairment based upon the projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
at december  long lived assets were million and no asset impairments were recorded during goodwill at least annually  we review our goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
if the result of this analysis indicates that an impairment charge is required  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets  resulting in an implied valuation of goodwill associated with the reporting unit 
we would measure the impairment based on the difference between the implied valuation of the goodwill and its actual carrying value 
during  we did not record any impairment charges for goodwill or identifiable intangibles 
goodwill and intangible assets totaled million at december  income taxes deferred tax assets are analyzed to determine if there will be sufficient taxable income in the future in order to realize such assets 
we assess all of the positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of the deferred tax assets  including our historical results of operations for the recent past and our projections of future results of operations  in which we make subjective determinations of future events 
if  after assessing all of the evidence  both positive and negative  a determination is made that the realizability of the deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we establish a deferred tax valuation allowance for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets depending upon the specific facts 
if any of the significant assumptions were changed  materially different results could occur  which could significantly change the amount of the deferred tax valuation allowance established 
as of december   due to our history of operating losses  we have a valuation allowance aga inst all deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  where we believe it is more likely than not that we will not have sufficient taxable income to utilize these assets before they expire 
product warranty accrual in connection with the accrual of warranty costs associated with our products  we make assumptions about the level of product failures that may occur in the future 
these assumptions are primarily based upon historical claims experience 
should the rate of future product failures significantly differ from historical levels  our accrued warranty reserves would need to be adjusted  and the amount of the adjustment could be material 
at december  accrued warranty was  and we incurred product warranty costs of  for the year then ended

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we are subject to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to our global operations 
we manufacture and sell our products primarily in north america  europe and asia 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets in which we manufacture and sell our products 
our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro  the singapore dollar and or the japanese yen

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued as currency exchange rates change  translation of the statements of operations of our international businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not hedge operating translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates are generally reported as a component of stockholders equity as all of our foreign subsidiaries report in their local currencies 
total other comprehensive income loss was   and  in  and  respectively  due to cumulative translation adjustments 
as of december  and  our net current assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency translation risk were million and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in net current assets from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be  and  respectively 
the sensitivity analysis presented assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
this assumption may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
interest rate risk as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we generally place our investments in us treasury obligations or money market funds backed by such investments 
we have not held and do not hold any derivatives related to our interest rate exposure 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that had the average yield of our investments decreased by basis points  our interest income for year ended december  would have decreased by less than  this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments
