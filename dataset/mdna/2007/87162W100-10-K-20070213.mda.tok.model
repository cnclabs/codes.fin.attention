overview we are a global information technology  or it  supply chain services company 
we offer a comprehensive range of services to it original equipment manufacturers and software publishers  collectively oems  and reseller customers worldwide 
the supply chain services that we offer include product distribution  related logistics and support services  contract assembly and demand generation marketing 
we have been in the it distribution business since and are one of the largest it product distributors based on reported revenue 
we focus our core wholesale distribution business on a limited number of leading it oems  which allows us to enhance and increase the value we provide to our oem suppliers and reseller customers 
because we offer distribution  contract assembly and demand generation marketing  oem suppliers and resellers can outsource to us multiple areas of their business outside of their core competencies 
this model allows us to provide services at several points along the it product supply chain 
we believe that the combination of our broad range of supply chain capabilities  our focus on serving the leading it oems and our efficient operations enables us to realize strong relationships with our oem suppliers and reseller customers 
we are headquartered in fremont  california and have distribution  sales and assembly facilities in the united states  canada  china  mexico and the united kingdom 
revenue and cost of revenue we derive our revenue primarily through the distribution of it systems  peripherals  system components  software and networking equipment  and  to a lesser extent  from contract assembly 
we recognize revenue in both our distribution and contract assembly operations generally as products are shipped  if a purchase order exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  risk of loss and title have transferred and product returns are reasonably estimable 
shipping terms are typically fob our warehouse 
provisions for sales returns are estimated based on historical data and are recorded concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
our distribution sales are made to reseller customers on a purchase order basis 
table of contents and generally relate to a specific order from a reseller s end user customer 
our contract assembly sales are generated from specific purchase orders received from our oem customers for a specified unit quantity 
we generally do not have long term sales agreements with our reseller or contract assembly customers 
revenue from our distribution business represented approximately  and of our total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
in our distribution business  our primary customers are resellers 
none of our reseller customers accounted for more than of our total revenue in fiscal  or approximately  and of our total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  was derived from the sale of hp products 
most of our remaining distribution revenue is derived from the distribution of it products of a relatively small number of other suppliers 
approximately  and of our total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  was derived from our contract assembly business 
we provide contract assembly services primarily to it product oems 
our contract assembly revenue is dependent on a small number of customers 
revenue from contract assembly provided to sun microsystems accounted for less than of our total revenue in fiscal and and approximately of our total revenue in sun microsystems accounted for approximately  and of our contract assembly revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the market for it products is generally characterized by declining unit prices and short product life cycles 
our distribution business is also highly competitive on the basis of price 
we set our sales price based on the market supply and demand characteristics for each particular product or bundle of products we distribute 
from time to time  we also participate in the incentive and rebate programs of our oem suppliers 
these programs are important determinants of the final sales price we charge to our reseller customers 
to mitigate the risk of declining prices and obsolescence of our distribution inventory  our oem suppliers generally offer us limited price protection and return rights for products that are marked down or discontinued by them 
we carefully manage our inventory to maximize the benefit to us of these supplier provided protections 
a significant portion of our cost of distribution revenue is the purchase price we pay our oem suppliers for the products we sell  net of any rebates and purchase discounts received from our oem suppliers 
cost of distribution revenue also consists of provisions for inventory losses and write downs  and freight expenses associated with the receipt in and shipment out of our inventory 
our contract assembly cost of revenue consists primarily of cost of materials  labor and overhead 
margins the it product distribution and contract assembly industries in which we operate are characterized by low gross profit as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  and low income from operations as a percentage of revenue  or operating margin 
our gross margin has fluctuated between and annually over the past three years due to changes in the mix of products we sell  customers we sell to  competition  seasonality and the general economic environment 
increased competition arising from industry consolidation and low demand for it products may hinder our ability to maintain or improve our gross margin 
generally  when our revenue becomes more concentrated on limited products or customers  our gross margin tends to decrease due to increased pricing pressure from oem suppliers or reseller customers 
our operating margin has also fluctuated between and annually over the past three years  based primarily on our ability to achieve economies of scale  the management of our operating expenses  changes in the relative mix of our distribution and contract assembly revenue and the timing of our acquisitions and investments 
recent acquisitions and divestitures we seek to augment our organic growth with strategic acquisitions of businesses and assets that complement and expand our supply chain service capabilities 
we also divest businesses that we deem not strategic to our ongoing operations 
our historical acquisitions have brought us new reseller customers and oem 
table of contents suppliers  extended the geographic reach of our operations  particularly in international markets  and expanded the services we provide to our oem suppliers and customers 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and include acquired entities within our consolidated financial statements from the closing date of the acquisition 
during the fiscal year ended november   we completed the following acquisitions on april   we acquired the assets of the telpar distribution segment of peak technologies  inc  or telpar  for approximately million 
telpar sold auto id  data capture and point of sales products and services 
the telpar business has been fully integrated within our distribution segment 
the aggregate purchase price was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of fair value 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired of  has been recognized as intangible assets 
on june   we acquired substantially all of the assets of the azerty united canada ink and toner distribution business of united stationers supply company  or azerty  for approximately million 
the azerty acquisition strengthens our position in printer supplies distribution in canada 
the azerty business has been fully integrated within our distribution segment 
the aggregate purchase price was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of fair value 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired of million has been recognized as goodwill and  has been recognized as intangible assets 
on september   our wholly owned subsidiary  bsa sales  llc  or bsa sales  acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of concentrix corporation or concentrix based in rochester  new york for approximately million 
concentrix is an integrated marketing company that provides call center  database analysis  and print on demand services to customers in the transportation  publishing  banking  healthcare and high technology industries 
concentrix s business strategy complements and expands our resources and capabilities of our demand generation business 
the acquisition agreement allowed for an earnout payment of million to be paid if certain milestones were met in the first days after the acquisition 
the defined milestones were not achieved and no earnout payment will be paid on this transaction 
we have accounted for the acquisition of capital stock as a purchase and accordingly the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired of million has been recognized as goodwill and million has been recognized as intangible assets 
the valuation of the identifiable intangible assets acquired was based on management s estimates using a valuation report prepared by an independent third party 
the concentrix and bsa sales operations have been merged under the name of concentrix corporation effective december  the above acquisitions  individually and in the aggregate  did not meet the conditions of a material business combination as defined by the securities and exchange commission 
as such  they were not subject to the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
however  we believe that disclosures provided herein are useful to the understanding of the goodwill and intangible assets activities through november  during the fiscal year ended november   we did not acquire any businesses and divested two of our subsidiaries  synnex kk and emj america  inc in may  we sold approximately of the equity in synnex kk  our japan subsidiary  to mcj company limited  or mcj  a japan based public company 
we sold our japan distribution business  as it was not strategic to our current north american focused distribution and assembly business model 
we received shares of mcj stock as consideration for synnex kk we were restricted from selling the mcj stock until one year after the sale date 
as a result of this equity investment  we recorded the gains or losses on our investment in each period  based on the closing price of mcj stock 
these non operating gains or losses are reported in other income expense  net 
in order to reduce the risk of holding the mcj shares  we entered into several forward contracts to sell mcj shares for a fixed price in april all the contracts were settled in april  and 
table of contents there were no contracts outstanding as of november  as of november   such contracts covered of the mcj shares held by the company 
in june  we sold the operations of our emj america  inc subsidiary to the management team of emj america 
emj america was a subsidiary of our canadian based subsidiary emj data systems limited  or emj  and was not in the same business as emj 
the operations of our emj america subsidiary were not material to us 
economic and industry trends our revenue is highly dependent on the end market demand for the it products that we distribute and assemble 
this end market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new it products and software by oems  replacement cycles for existing it products and overall economic growth and general business activity 
a difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the it distribution industry and increased price based competition 
seasonality our operating results are affected by the seasonality of the it products industry 
we have historically experienced higher sales in our fourth fiscal quarter due to patterns in the capital budgeting  federal government spending and purchasing cycles of our customers and end users 
these patterns may not be repeated in subsequent periods 
deferred compensation plan we have a deferred compensation plan for a limited number of our directors and employees 
we maintain a liability on our balance sheet for salary and bonus amounts deferred by participants and we accrue interest expense on unpaid amounts 
interest expense on the deferred amounts is classified in interest expense and finance charges  net on our consolidated statement of operations 
the plan allows for the participants to direct investments of deferred amounts in equity securities 
these equity investments are classified as trading securities 
gaap requires that gains losses on the deferred compensation equity securities be recorded in other income expense  net and that an equal amount be charged or credited if losses to selling  general and administrative expenses relating to compensation amounts which are payable to the plan participants 
deferred compensation expense was million  million  and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
unearned share based compensation in prior years  in connection with the granting of restricted stock and employee stock options that had exercise prices determined to be below fair market value on the date of grant  we recorded unearned share based compensation 
unearned share based compensation represents the difference between the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and either the exercise price of stock options or the fair market value of restricted stock awards  as the case may be 
unearned share based compensation is included as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized over the vesting period of the applicable stock options or restricted stock awards  generally five years  using the straight line method 
our share based compensation expense relates to stock options granted to individuals and is reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the balance of the unearned share based compensation was million as of november   due to the issuance of restricted stock and stock options 
the balance of unearned share based compensation was reclassified to additional paid in capital upon adoption of sfas no 
r  effective december  share based compensation expense was million   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
insurance coverage from time to time  we have experienced incidents of theft at various facilities 
in fiscal and fiscal we experienced theft as a result of break ins at four of our warehouses in which approximately million of 
table of contents inventory was stolen 
based on our investigation  discussions with local law enforcement and meetings with federal authorities  we believe the thefts at our warehouses were part of an organized crime effort that targeted a number of technology equipment warehouses throughout the united states 
as a result of the losses in  we reduced our inventory value by million  and recorded estimated proceeds  net of deductibles as a receivable from our insurance company  included within other current assets on our balance sheet as of november  in january we received a final settlement from our insurance company that amounted to substantially all of the receivable recorded as of november  in march  approximately million of inventory was stolen from our facility in the city of industry  california 
we subsequently recovered approximately million through law enforcement and federal authorities 
we filed a claim with our insurance provider for the amount of the loss  less a small deductible 
we have received substantially all of the claimed amount 
these types of incidents may make it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain theft coverage in the future 
there is no assurance that future incidents of theft will not recur 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussions and analyses of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we review and evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that relate to accounts receivable  vendor programs  inventories  intangible assets and other long lived assets  share based compensation  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
our estimates are based on our historical experience and a variety of other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making our judgment about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by our judgment  estimates and or assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue generally as products are shipped  if a purchase order exists  the sale price is fixed or determinable  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  risk of loss and title have transferred and product returns are reasonably estimable 
shipping terms are typically fob our warehouse 
provisions for sales returns are estimated based on historical data and are recorded concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
these provisions are reviewed and adjusted periodically by us 
revenue is reduced for early payment discounts and volume incentive rebates offered to customers 
we purchase licensed software products from original equipment manufacturer or oem vendors and distribute them to customers 
revenue is recognized upon shipment of software products when a purchase order exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is determined to be probable 
subsequent to the sale of software products  we generally have no obligation to provide any modification  customization  upgrades  enhancements  or any other post contract customer support 
our mexico operation entered into a multi year contract to sell equipment to a contractor that provides equipment and services to the mexican government 
under the agreement  the mexican government makes payments into our account 
the payments on this contract by the mexican government are generally due on a 
table of contents monthly basis and are contingent upon the contractor continuing to provide services to the government 
we recognize product revenue and cost of revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
share based compensation 
effective december   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment or sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases  based on estimated fair values 
we previously applied accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation or sfas no 
 which was superseded by sfas no 
r 
we applied the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
relating to sfas no 
r 
accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for doubtful accounts on our accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  which may result in the impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in estimating our allowance  we take into consideration the overall quality and aging of our receivable portfolio  our continuing credit evaluation of our customers financial condition  current economic trends  historical experience with collections and collateral obtained from our customers in certain circumstances 
oem supplier programs 
we receive funds from oem suppliers for inventory price protection  product rebates  marketing and infrastructure reimbursement  and promotion programs 
product rebates are recorded as a reduction of cost of revenue 
marketing  infrastructure and promotion programs are recorded  net of direct costs  in selling  general and administrative expense 
any excess funds associated with these programs are recorded in cost of revenue 
we accrue rebates based on the terms of the program and sales of qualifying products 
some of these programs may extend over one or more quarterly reporting periods 
amounts received or receivable from oem suppliers that are not yet earned are deferred on our balance sheet 
actual rebates may vary based on volume or other sales achievement levels  which could result in an increase or reduction in the estimated amounts previously accrued 
in addition  if market conditions were to deteriorate due to an economic downturn  oem suppliers may change the terms of some or all of these programs or cease them altogether 
any such change could lower our gross margins on products we sell or revenue earned 
we also provide reserves for receivables on oem supplier programs for estimated losses resulting from oem suppliers inability to pay  or rejections of such claims by oem suppliers 
inventories 
our inventory levels are based on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
any sudden decline in demand and or rapid product improvements and technological changes can cause us to have excess and or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their estimated net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
these write downs are reflected in our cost of revenue 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory reserves may be required 
our estimates are influenced by the following considerations sudden decline in demand due to economic downturns  rapid product improvements and technological changes  our ability to return to oem suppliers a certain percentage of our purchases  and protection from loss in value of inventory under our oem supplier agreements 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we assess potential impairment of our goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets when there is evidence that recent events or changes in circumstances have made recovery of an asset s carrying value unlikely 
we also assess potential impairment of our goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets on an annual basis 
if indicators of impairment were present in intangible assets used in operations and future cash flows were not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount  an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified 
the amount of an impairment loss would be recognized as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 

table of contents factors we consider important  which may cause an impairment include significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset  negative industry or economic trends  and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we have to estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenue and expenses  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  we have to provide a valuation allowance based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions  and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable 
the provision for current and deferred taxes involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations by various taxing authorities 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
contingencies and litigation 
there are various claims  lawsuits and pending actions against us incident to our operations 
if a loss arising from these actions is probable and can be reasonably estimated  we record the amount of the loss  or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range within which no point is more probable than another 
based on current available information  we believe that the ultimate resolution of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as additional information becomes available  we assess any potential liability related to these actions and may need to revise our estimates 
future revisions of our estimates could materially impact the results of our operations  financial position or cash flows 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the indicated periods  data as percentages of revenue fiscal years ended november  statements of operations data revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from continuing operations before non operating items  income taxes and minority interest interest expense and finance charges  net other income expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes minority interest in subsidiaries income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of tax net income

our contract assembly gross margin percentage decreased due to changes in pricing and product mix with our largest contract assembly customer  sun microsystems  partially offset by an improvement in margin in our non sun assembly business 
while we currently do not expect any significant change in our total gross margin  it may decrease in future periods as a result of the relative mix of our distribution and contract assembly revenue  distribution customer mix  potential increased competition  softness in the overall economy or changes to the terms and conditions in which we do business with our oems

the primary uses of cash have been to fund increases in inventory and accounts receivable resulting from increased sales  and for acquisitions 
to increase our market share and better serve our customers  we may further expand our operations through investments or acquisitions 
we expect that this expansion would require an initial investment in personnel  
table of contents facilities and operations  which may be more costly than similar investments in current operations 
as a result of these investments  we may experience an increase in cost of sales and operating expenses that is disproportionate to revenue from those operations

off balance sheet arrangements we have a six year revolving accounts receivable securitization program in the united states  or us arrangement  which provides for the sale of up to million of us trade accounts receivable  or us receivables  to two financial institutions 
the program expires in august in connection with this program substantially all of our us trade accounts receivable are transferred without recourse to our wholly owned subsidiary  which  in turn  sells an undivided interest in the us receivables to the financial institutions 
sales of the us receivables to the financial institutions under this program result in a reduction of total accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheet 
the remaining accounts receivable not sold to the financial institutions are carried at their net realizable value  including an allowance for doubtful accounts 
our effective borrowing cost under the program is the prevailing dealer commercial paper rate of return plus per annum 
at november  and  the amount of us receivables sold to and held by the financial institutions under us arrangement totaled million and million  respectively

we believe that available funding under our accounts receivable securitization programs provides us increased flexibility to make incremental investments in strategic growth initiatives and to manage working capital requirements  and that there are sufficient trade accounts receivable to support the us and canadian arrangements 
as we have in prior periods  we expect we will increase these programs if our revenue levels continue to increase 
under these programs  we continue to service the accounts receivable  and receive a service fee from the financial institutions for the us arrangement 
in connection with this canadian arrangement  we issued a guarantee of synnex canada s performance under the canadian arrangement

as is customary in trade accounts receivable securitization arrangements  a credit rating agency s downgrade of the third party issuer of commercial paper or of a back up liquidity provider which provides a source of funding if the commercial paper market cannot be accessed could result in an adverse change or loss of our financing capacity under these programs if the commercial paper issuer or liquidity back up provider is not replaced
