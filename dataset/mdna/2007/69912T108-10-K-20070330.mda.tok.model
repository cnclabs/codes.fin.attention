capacity utilization attempts to measure what percent of available capacity is actually being utilized 
management believes that when capacity utilization rises and falls  the company may see a corresponding change in the rate of new orders  and therefore  a corresponding change in backlog and sales may also occur 
the backlog of orders represents the uncompleted portion of systems contracts along with the value of parts and services from customer purchase orders related to goods that have not been shipped or services that have not been rendered 
backlog is generally indicative of customer demand for the company s products 
as the demand for the company s products increases  the backlog of orders  the rate of new orders  and sales also typically increases

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information  including the related disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the company s financial statements 
actual results may  under different assumptions and conditions  differ significantly from the company s estimates 
the company believes that its accounting policies related to revenue recognition on systems sales  warranty  and inventories are its critical accounting policies 
these policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors and are discussed in greater detail below 
revenue recognition on systems sales revenues on systems contracts  accounted for in accordance with sop of the american institute of certified public accountants  are recorded on the basis of the company s estimates of the percentage of completion of individual contracts 
gross margin is recognized on the basis of the ratio of aggregate costs incurred to date to the most recent estimate of total costs 
as contracts may extend over one or more years  revisions in cost and profit estimates during the course of the work are reflected in the accounting periods in which the facts requiring revisions become known 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is accrued 
as of december   there are no contracts that are anticipated to result in a loss 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued revenue recognition on systems sales continued the company believes that it has the ability to reasonably estimate the total costs and applicable gross profit margins at the inception of the contract for all of its systems contracts 
however  where cost estimates change  there could be a significant impact on the amount of revenue recognized 
the company s failure to estimate accurately can result in cost overruns which will result in the loss of profits if the company determines that it has significantly underestimated the costs involved in completing contracts 
the company has not had any significant cost overruns resulting in loss of profits during the past three years 
accrued product warranty the company s products are warranted against defects in materials and workmanship for varying periods of time depending on customer requirements and the type of system sold  with a typical warranty period of one year 
the company provides an accrual for estimated future warranty costs and potential product liability claims based upon a percentage of cost of sales  typically two percent of the cost of the system being sold  and a detailed review of products still in the warranty period 
historically  the level of warranty reserve has been appropriate based on management s assessment of estimated future warranty claims 
however  if unanticipated warranty issues arise in the future  there could be a significant impact on the recorded warranty reserve 
the warranty reserve as of december  is  inventories inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market 
the company provides an inventory reserve determined by a specific identification of individual slow moving items and other inventory items based on historical experience 
the reserve is considered to be a write down of inventory to a new cost basis 
upon disposal of inventory  the new cost basis is removed from the accounts
