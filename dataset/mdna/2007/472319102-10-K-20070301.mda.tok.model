it is possible that the actual results may differ  possibly materially  from the anticipated results indicated in these forward looking statements 
information regarding important factors that could cause actual results to differ  perhaps materially  from those in our forward looking statements is contained in this report and other documents we file

any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement is made 
we will not update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which the statement is made 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
actual results can and will differ from estimates 
these differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies and the estimates required therein are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly re evaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our management believes our critical accounting policies policies that are both material to the financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are our valuation methodologies applied to investments  certain securities positions and otc derivatives and our use of estimates related to compensation and benefits during the year 

table of contents fair value of financial instruments investments are stated at fair value as determined in good faith by management 
factors considered in valuing individual investments include  without limitation  available market prices  reported net asset values  type of security  purchase price  purchases of the same or similar securities by other investors  marketability  restrictions on disposition  current financial position and operating results  and other pertinent information 
furthermore  judgment is used to value certain securities eg  private securities  a securities  less liquid securities if quoted current market prices are not available 
these valuations are made with consideration for various assumptions  including time value  yield curve  volatility factors  liquidity  market prices on comparable securities and other factors 
the subjectivity involved in this process makes these valuations inherently less reliable than quoted market prices 
we believe that our comprehensive risk management policies and procedures serve to monitor the appropriateness of the assumptions used 
the use of different assumptions  however  could produce materially different estimates of fair value 
fair value of derivatives fair values of exchange traded derivatives are generally determined from quoted market prices 
otc derivatives are valued using valuation models 
the valuation models that we use to derive the fair values of our otc derivatives require inputs including contractual terms  market prices  yield curves  measures of volatility and correlations of such inputs 
the selection of a model to value an otc derivative depends upon the contractual terms of  and specific risks inherent in  the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market 
we generally use similar models to value similar instruments 
where possible  we compare and verify the values produced by our pricing models to market transactions 
for otc derivatives that trade in liquid markets  such as generic forwards  swaps and options  model selection does not involve significant judgment because market prices are readily available 
for otc derivatives that trade in less liquid markets  model selection and inputs require more judgment because such instruments tend to be more complex and pricing information is less available in the market 
as markets continue to develop and more pricing information becomes available  we continue to review and refine the models that we use 
at the inception of an otc derivative contract day one  we value the contract at the model value if we can verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model to market transactions 
if we cannot verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model to market transactions  we value the contract at the transaction price at inception and  consequently  record no day one gain or loss in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
subsequent to the transaction date  we recognize trading profits deferred at inception of the derivative transaction in the period in which the valuation of such instrument becomes observable 
compensation and benefits the use of estimates is important in determining compensation and benefits expenses for interim and year end periods 
a substantial portion of our compensation and benefits represents discretionary bonuses  which are fixed at year end 
in addition to the level of net revenues  our overall compensation expense in any given year is influenced by prevailing labor markets  revenue mix and our use of equity based compensation programs 
we believe the most appropriate way to allocate estimated annual discretionary bonuses among interim periods is in proportion to projected net revenues earned 
consequently  we have generally accrued interim compensation and benefits based on annual targeted compensation ratios  taking into account the guidance contained in fasb r regarding the timing of expense recognition for non retirement eligible and retirement eligible employees 
our fourth quarter reflects the difference between the compensation and benefits we determine at year end and the accruals recorded through the end of the third quarter 

table of contents revenues by source for presentation purposes  the remainder of results of operations is presented on a detailed product and expense basis rather than on a business segment basis 
our earnings are subject to wide fluctuations since many factors over which we have little or no control  particularly the overall volume of trading  the volatility and general level of market prices  and the number and size of investment banking transactions may significantly affect our operations 
the following provides a summary of revenues by source for the past three years

compensation and benefits compensation and benefits  including the amortization of previously awarded equity awards  increased million  or  versus the increase in net revenues 
the increase was consistent with our increase in headcount and change to our revenue mix offset by changes to fasb r guidance regarding the timing of expense recognition for non retirement eligible employees 
under fasb we defined the service period over which compensation costs should be recognized to generally include the year prior to the grant and the subsequent vesting periods 
with the adoption of fasb r  our policy regarding the timing of expense recognition for non retirement eligible employees changed to recognize compensation cost over the period from the service inception date which is the grant date through the date the employee is no longer required to provide service to earn the award

table of contents liquidity  financial condition and capital resources our chief financial officer and treasurer are responsible for developing and implementing our liquidity  funding and capital management strategies 
these policies are determined by the nature of our day to day business operations  business growth possibilities  regulatory obligations  and liquidity requirements 
our actual level of capital  total assets  and financial leverage are a function of a number of factors  including  asset composition  business initiatives  regulatory requirements and cost availability of both long term and short term funding 
we have historically maintained a highly liquid balance sheet  with a substantial portion of our total assets consisting of cash  highly liquid marketable securities and short term receivables  arising principally from traditional securities brokerage activity 
the highly liquid nature of these assets provides us with flexibility in financing and managing our business 
liquidity the following are financial instruments that are cash and cash equivalents or are deemed by management to be generally readily convertible into cash  marginable or accessible for liquidity purposes within a relatively short period of time in thousands of dollars december  december  cash and cash equivalents cash in banks money market investments total cash and cash equivalents cash and securities segregated

items are included in financial instruments owned see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
items are financial instruments utilized in our overall cash management activities and are readily convertible to cash in normal market conditions 
unsecured bank loans are typically overnight loans used to finance financial instruments owned or clearing related balances 
there were no unsecured bank loans at december  and december  average daily bank loans for the years ended december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
a substantial portion of our assets are liquid  consisting of cash or assets readily convertible into cash 
the majority of securities positions both long and short in our trading accounts are readily marketable and actively traded 
in addition  receivables from brokers and dealers are primarily current open transactions or securities borrowed transactions  which are typically settled or closed out within a few days 
receivable from customers includes margin balances and amounts due on transactions in the process of settlement 
most of our receivables are secured by marketable securities 

table of contents our assets are funded by equity capital  senior debt  mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock  securities loaned  customer free credit balances  bank loans and other payables 
bank loans represent temporary usually overnight secured and unsecured short term borrowings  which are generally payable on demand 
we have arrangements with banks for unsecured financing of up to million 
secured bank loans are collateralized by a combination of customer  non customer and firm securities 
we have always been able to obtain necessary short term borrowings in the past and believe that we will continue to be able to do so in the future 
additionally  we have million in letters of credit outstanding as of december   which are used in the normal course of business mostly to satisfy various collateral requirements in lieu of depositing cash or securities 
excess liquidity our policy is to maintain excess liquidity to cover all expected cash outflows for one year in a stressed liquidity environment 
liquid resources consist of unrestricted cash and unencumbered assets that are readily convertible into cash on a secured basis on short notice 
certain investments  short term bond funds and auction rated convertibles are also readily convertible to cash 
in addition  we have million of unsecured  uncommitted lines of credit with various banks 
management believes these resources provide sufficient excess liquidity to cover all expected cash outflows  inclusive of potential equity repurchases  for one year during a stressed liquidity environment

tangible stockholders equity  pro forma book value per share  tangible book value per share and pro forma tangible book value per share are non gaap financial measures 
a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance that includes adjustments to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  or for which there is no specific gaap guidance 
we calculate tangible stockholders equity as stockholders equity less intangible assets 
we calculate pro forma book value per share as stockholders equity plus the projected deferred tax benefit on the vested portion of restricted stock and rsus divided by common shares outstanding adjusted for shares not yet issued to the extent of the related expense amortization and shares issued to the extent the related expense has not been amortized 
we calculate tangible book value per share by dividing tangible stockholders equity by common stock outstanding 
we calculate pro forma tangible book value per share by dividing tangible stockholders equity plus the projected deferred tax benefit on the vested portion of restricted stock and rsus by common shares outstanding adjusted for shares not yet issued to the extent of the related expense amortization and shares issued to the extent the related expense has not been amortized 
we consider these ratios as meaningful measurements of our financial condition and believe they provide investors with additional metrics to comparatively assess the fair market value of our stock 

table of contents capital resources we have total long term capital of billion and billion resulting in a long term debt to total capital ratio of and  at year end and  respectively 
our total capital base as of december was as follows in thousands december  december  long term debt mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock total stockholders equity total capital our ability to support increases in total assets is largely a function of our ability to obtain short term secured and unsecured funding  primarily through securities lending  and through our million of uncommitted unsecured bank lines

we rely upon our cash holdings and external sources to finance a significant portion of our day to day operations 
access to these external sources  as well as the cost of that financing  is dependent upon various factors  including our debt ratings 
our current debt ratings are dependent upon many factors  including operating results  operating margins  earnings trend and volatility  balance sheet composition  liquidity and liquidity management  our capital structure  our overall risk management  business diversification and our market share and competitive position in the markets in which we operate 
our long term debt ratings are as follows rating moody s investors services baa standard and poor s bbb fitch ratings bbb jefferies and jefferies execution are subject to the net capital requirements of the sec and other regulators  which are designed to measure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers

leverage ratios the following table presents total assets  adjusted assets  and net adjusted assets with the resulting leverage ratios as of december  and december  with respect to leverage ratio  we believe that net adjusted leverage is the most relevant measure  given the low risk  collateralized nature of our securities borrowed and segregated cash assets 
december  december  total assets adjusted assets net adjusted assets leverage ratio adjusted leverage ratio net adjusted leverage ratio adjusted assets are total assets less cash and securities segregated 
net adjusted assets are adjusted assets  less securities borrowed 
leverage ratio equals total assets divided by stockholders equity 
adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by stockholders equity 
net adjusted leverage ratio equals net adjusted assets divided by stockholders equity 
stock repurchases during  we purchased  shares of our common stock for million mostly in connection with our stock compensation plans which allow participants to use shares to pay the exercise price of options exercised and to use shares to satisfy tax liabilities arising from the exercise of options or the vesting of restricted stock 
the number above does not include unvested shares forfeited back to us pursuant to the terms of our stock compensation plans 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to make these repurchases without any material adverse effect on us

we do not believe that our investment or the operations of the company will have a material adverse impact on us 
off balance sheet arrangements information concerning our off balance sheet arrangements are included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
such information is hereby incorporated by reference 
effects of changes in foreign currency rates we maintain a foreign securities business in our foreign offices london  paris  tokyo and zurich as well as in some of our domestic offices 
most of these activities are hedged by related foreign currency liabilities or by forward exchange contracts 
however  we are still subject to some foreign currency risk 
a change in the foreign currency rates could create either a foreign currency transaction gain loss recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings or a foreign currency translation adjustment to the stockholders equity section of our consolidated statements of financial condition 
effects of inflation based on today s modest inflationary rates and because our assets are primarily monetary in nature  consisting of cash and cash equivalents  securities and receivables  we believe that our assets are not significantly affected by inflation 
the rate of inflation  however  can affect various expenses  including employee compensation  communications and technology and occupancy  which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us 

table of contents risk management risk is an inherent part of our business and activities 
the extent to which we properly and effectively identify  assess  monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our activities is critical to our financial soundness and profitability 
we seek to identify  assess  monitor and manage the following principal risks involved in our business activities market  credit  operational  legal and compliance and new business 
risk management is a multi faceted process that requires communication  judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets 
senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment and control of various risks 
our risk management policies  procedures and methodologies are fluid in nature and are subject to ongoing review and modification 
market risk 
the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments is referred to as market risk 
our market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from a change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices and the correlation among them  along with the level of volatility 
interest rate risks result primarily from exposure to changes in the yield curve  the volatility of interest rates  and credit spreads 
equity price risks result from exposure to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities  equity baskets and equity indices 
commodity price risks result from exposure to the changes in prices and volatilities of individual commodities  commodity baskets and commodity indices 
we make dealer markets in equity securities  debt securities and commodities 
to facilitate customer order flow  we may be required to own equity and debt securities in our trading and inventory accounts 
we attempt to hedge our exposure to market risk by managing our net long or short position 
due to imperfections in correlations  gains and losses can occur even for positions that are hedged 
position limits in trading and inventory accounts are established and monitored on an ongoing basis 
each day  consolidated position and exposure reports are prepared and distributed to various levels of management  which enable management to monitor inventory levels and results of the trading groups 
credit risk 
credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a client  counterparty or issuer of securities or other instruments held by us fails to perform its contractual obligations 
we follow industry practices to reduce credit risk related to various trading  investing and financing activities by obtaining and maintaining collateral 
we adjust margin requirements if we believe the risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
liabilities to other brokers and dealers related to unsettled transactions ie  securities failed to receive are recorded at the amount for which the securities were purchased  and are paid upon receipt of the securities from other brokers or dealers 
in the case of aged securities failed to receive  we may purchase the underlying security in the market and seek reimbursement for losses from the counterparty in accordance with standard industry practices 
operational risk 
operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in our operating systems  business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in our internal control processes 
our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies 
in addition  the transactions we process have become increasingly complex 
if any of our financial  accounting or other data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes  people or systems  we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity  financial loss  a disruption of our businesses  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
these systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings 
the inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses 
we also face the risk of operational failure or termination of any of the clearing agents  exchanges  clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions 
any such failure or termination could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk 
in addition  despite the contingency plans we have in place  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located 
this may include a disruption involving electrical  communications  transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business 

table of contents our operations rely on the secure processing  storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks 
although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant  our computer systems  software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses or other malicious code  and other events that could have a security impact 
if one or more of such events occur  this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients or counterparties confidential and other information processed and stored in  and transmitted through  our computer systems and networks  or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our  our clients  our counterparties or third parties operations 
we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures  and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us 
legal and compliance risk 
legal and compliance risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
we are subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
we have various procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  credit granting  collection activities  anti money laundering and record keeping 
we also maintain an anonymous hotline for employees or others to report suspected inappropriate actions by us or by our employees or agents 
new business risk 
new business risk refers to the risks of entering into a new line of business or offering a new product 
by entering a new line of business or offering a new product  we may face risks that we are unaccustomed to dealing with and may increase the magnitude of the risks we currently face 
we review proposals for new businesses and new products to determine if we are prepared to handle the additional or increased risks associated with entering into such activities 
reputational risk 
we recognize that maintaining our reputation among clients  investors  regulators and the general public is an important aspect of minimizing legal and operational risks 
maintaining our reputation depends on a large number of factors  including the selection of our clients and the conduct of our business activities 
we seek to maintain our reputation by screening potential clients and by conducting our business activities in accordance with high ethical standards 
other risk 
other risks encountered by us include political  regulatory and tax risks 
these risks reflect the potential impact that changes in local and international laws and tax statutes have on the economics and viability of current or future transactions 
in an effort to mitigate these risks  we continuously review new and pending regulations and legislation and participate in various industry interest groups 
accounting and regulatory developments in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force on issue  determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights  eitf 
eitf presumes that a general partner controls a limited partnership  and should therefore consolidate a limited partnership  unless the limited partners have the substantive ability to remove the general partner without cause based on a simple majority vote or can otherwise dissolve the limited partnership  or unless the limited partners have substantive participating rights over decision making 
this guidance became effective upon ratification by the fasb on june  for all newly formed limited partnerships and for existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements have been modified 
for all other limited partnerships  the guidance is effective no later than the beginning of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after december  as of january  we have generally provided limited partners with rights to remove us as general partner or rights to terminate the partnership  and therefore  the impact of adopting eitf was not material 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position fin r  determining the variability to be considered in applying fasb interpretation no 
r  fsp fin r 
fsp fin r addresses how variability should be considered when applying fin r 
variability affects the determination of whether an entity is a variable interest entity vie  which interests are variable interests  and which party  if any  is the primary beneficiary of the vie required to consolidate 
fsp fin r clarifies that the design of the entity also should be considered when identifying which interests are variable interests 
fsp fin r must be applied 
table of contents prospectively to all entities in which we first become involved  beginning july  the adoption of fsp fin r did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe that the adoption of fin will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued fasb no 
 fair value measurements fasb 
fasb clarifies that fair value is the amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability  in an orderly transaction between market participants 
fasb reverses the consensus reached in eitf issue no 
prohibiting the recognition of day one gain or loss on derivative contracts where we cannot verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model to market transactions 
however  fasb requires that a fair value measurement technique include an adjustment for risks inherent in a particular valuation technique such as a pricing model and or the risks inherent in the inputs to the model  if market participants would also include such an adjustment 
in addition  fasb prohibits the recognition of block discounts for large holdings of unrestricted financial instruments where quoted prices are readily and regularly available in an active market 
the provisions of fasb are to be applied prospectively  except for changes in fair value measurements that result from the initial application of fasb to existing derivative financial instruments measured under eitf issue no 
 existing hybrid instruments measured at fair value  and block discounts  which are to be recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption 
fasb is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we intend to adopt fasb in the first quarter of to determine the transition adjustment to opening retained earnings  we have performed an analysis of existing derivative instruments measured under eitf issue and block discounts 
the transition adjustment to opening retained earnings will not have a material effect on our financial condition 
we are currently evaluating the impact of fasb on our results of operations for the first quarter of in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for uncertainty in employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r fasb 
fasb requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
this statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position  with limited exceptions 
an employer with publicly traded equity securities is required to initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december  the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after december  on december   we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of fasb fasb required us to recognize the funded status ie  the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of our benefit plan in the december  consolidated statement of financial condition  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
as a result of the pension plan being frozen  the projected benefit obligation was equal to the accumulated benefit obligation 
consequently  no additional adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income was necessary 
on february   the fasb issued fasb no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fasb 
this standard permits an entity to measure financial instruments and certain other items at estimated fair value 
most of the provisions of fasb no 
are elective  however  the amendment to fasb no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  applies to all entities that own trading and available for sale securities 
the fair value option created by fasb permits an entity to measure eligible items at fair value as of specified election dates 
the fair value option a may generally be applied instrument by instrument  b is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs  and c must be applied to the entire instrument and not to only a portion of the instrument

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements sab 
sab addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors 
sab no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab no 
did not have material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use a number of quantitative tools to manage our exposure to market risk 
these tools include inventory position and exposure limits  on a gross and net basis  scenario analyses  stress tests and other analytical tools that measure the potential effects on our trading net revenues of various market events  including  but not limited to  a large widening of credit spreads  a substantial decline in equities markets and significant moves in selected emerging markets  and risk limits based on a summary measure of risk exposure referred to as value at risk var 
value at risk in general  var measures potential loss of trading revenues at a given confidence level over a specified time horizon 
we calculate var over a one day holding period measured at a confidence level which implies the potential loss of daily trading revenue is expected to be at least as large as the var amount on one out of every twenty trading days 
var is one measurement of potential loss in trading revenues that may result from adverse market movements over a specified period of time with a selected likelihood of occurrence 
as with all measures of var  our estimate has substantial limitations due to our reliance on historical performance  which is not necessarily a predictor of the future 
consequently  this var estimate is only one of a number of tools we use in our daily risk management activities 
the var numbers below are shown separately for interest rate  equity  currency and commodity products  as well as for our overall trading positions  excluding corporate investments in asset management positions  using a historical simulation approach 
the aggregated var presented here is less than the sum of the individual components ie  interest rate risk  foreign exchange rate risk  equity risk and commodity price risk due to the benefit of diversification among the risk categories 
diversification benefit equals the difference between aggregated var and the sum of vars for the four risk categories 
the following table illustrates the var for each component of market risk 
daily var in millions value at risk in trading portfolios at year ending year ending risk categories average high low average high low interest rates equity prices currency rates commodity prices diversification effect firmwide var is the potential loss in value of our trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specific confidence level 
for the var numbers reported above  a one day time horizon and confidence level were used 
average firmwide var of million during increased from the million average during due to an increase in exposure to equity prices  interest rates  and commodity prices 

table of contents the following table presents our daily var over the last four quarters daily var trend the increase in var in the first quarter of is related to a large block trading opportunity from an investment banking relationship that was closed during the quarter ended march  var back testing the comparison of daily actual revenue fluctuations with the daily var estimate is the primary method used to test the efficacy of the var model 
a back testing exception occurs when the daily loss exceeds the daily var estimate 
results of the process at the aggregate level demonstrated eight outliers when comparing the one day var with the back testing profit and loss in a confidence one day var model should not have more than twelve out of days back testing exceptions on an annual basis under normal market conditions 
back testing profit and loss is a subset of actual trading revenue and includes the profit and loss effects relevant to the var model  excluding fees  commissions and certain provisions 
we compare the trading revenue with var for back testing purposes because var assesses only the potential change in position value due to overnight movements in financial market variables such as prices  interest rates and volatilities under normal market conditions 
the graph below illustrates the relationship between daily back testing profit and loss and daily var for us in relationship between back testing p l abd var estimates during 
table of contents var is a model that estimates the future risk based on historical data 
we could incur losses greater than the reported var because the historical market prices and rates changes may not be an accurate measure of future market events and conditions 
in addition  the var model measures the risk of a current static position over a one day horizon and might not predict the future position 
when comparing our var numbers to those of other firms  it is important to remember that different methodologies could produce significantly different results
