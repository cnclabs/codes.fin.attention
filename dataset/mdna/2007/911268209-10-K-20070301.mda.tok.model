year ended december  compared to year ended december  comparability on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options  restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan employee stock purchases based on the grant date fair values of the awards 
sfas no 
r supersedes our previous accounting under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
relating to sfas no 
r 
we have applied the provisions of sab no 
in our adoption of sfas no 
r 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  and the company s consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december  reflect the impact of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas no 
r 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas no 
r for the year ended december  was million  which was primarily related to stock options  restricted stock and the discount on employee stock purchases 
stock based compensation expense  recorded in accordance with apb opinion no 
 for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  which was primarily related to restricted stock 
sfas no 
r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the grant date using an option pricing model 
under sfas no 
 we used the black scholes option pricing model for valuation of share based awards for our pro forma information 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we elected to continue to use the black scholes option pricing model for valuing awards 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for share based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 
as allowed under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the intrinsic value method  no stock based compensation expense related to stock options had been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations  other than as related to acquisitions  because the exercise price of our stock options granted to employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the current period is based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant in order to calculate the amount of share based awards that will ultimately vest 
the forfeiture rate is based on historical rates 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  includes i compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested at  december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas no 
and ii compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
for the periods prior to  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
accordingly  a pretax cumulative effect of accounting change adjustment totaling million million  net of tax was recorded in the march quarter to adjust for awards granted prior to january  that are not ultimately expected to vest 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we recognized stock based compensation expense for awards with graded vesting by treating each vesting tranche as a separate award and recognizing compensation expense ratably for each tranche 
for equity awards granted subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we treat such awards as a single award and recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis net of estimated forfeitures over the employee service period 
in december  our compensation committee of the board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of all options to purchase our common stock with exercise prices in excess of 
these options were granted to executive officers and other employees 
options to purchase million shares of our common stock were subject to this acceleration and such options had exercise prices ranging from to  and had a weighted average exercise price of 
the acceleration of vesting of these out of the money options was undertaken primarily to eliminate any future compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our income statement with respect to these options with the implementation of sfas no 
r effective january  we estimated this compensation expense  before tax  would have totaled approximately million over the course of the original vesting periods 
ninety five percent of the options would have vested within approximately years from the effective date of the acceleration with the remaining vesting within approximately years from the date of acceleration 
we also believed that because the options to be accelerated had exercise prices in excess of the then current market value of our common stock  the options had limited economic value and were not fully achieving their original objective of incentive compensation and employee retention 
beginning in may  we shifted from a strategy of granting a combination of stock options and rsus to solely granting rsus 
additionally  in march  we offered eligible employees the opportunity to exchange any outstanding stock options granted to them  which had an exercise price per share of our common stock at or above the eligible options in return for rsus 
the exchange offer expired in april  and approximately million shares of common stock underlying eligible options were exchanged for rsus covering approximately million shares of common stock in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible options 
total expense associated with the exchange  prior to the consideration of expected forfeitures  was approximately million 
total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options at december   prior to the consideration of expected forfeitures  is approximately million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock and rsus at december  prior to the consideration of expected forfeitures is approximately million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
revenues billable services revenues billable services revenues consist of fees charged to pay accounts for our pay services and for technical support 
our billable services revenues are primarily dependent on two factors the average number of pay accounts for a period and the average monthly revenue per pay account arpu for a period 
the average number of pay accounts is a simple average calculated based on the number of pay accounts at the beginning and end of a period 
arpu is calculated by dividing billable services revenues for a period by the average number of pay accounts for that period 
arpu may fluctuate from period to period as a result of a variety of factors including changes in the mix of pay subscriptions and their related pricing plans  the use of promotions  such as one or more free months of service  and discounted pricing plans to obtain or retain subscribers  increases or decreases in the price of our services  the number of services subscribed to by each pay account  pricing and success of new pay services and the penetration of these types of services as a percentage of total pay accounts  and the timing of pay accounts being added or removed during a period 
consolidated billable services revenues 
consolidated billable services revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in billable services revenues was due to a decrease in billable services revenues from our communications segment  partially offset by an increase in revenues from our content media segment 
billable services revenues from our communications segment and from our content media segment constituted and  respectively  of our consolidated billable services revenues for the year ended december   compared to and  respectively  for the year ended december  we anticipate that our consolidated billable services revenues will continue to decline as a result of expected continued declines in communications billable services revenues 
communications billable services revenues 
communications billable services revenues consist of fees charged to pay accounts for access  email  internet security and other services  with substantially all generated from access 
communications billable services revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in billable services revenues was due to an decrease in our average number of pay accounts from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease in average number of pay accounts is attributable to a decreased number of pay access accounts 
additionally  communications billable services revenues decreased due to a decrease in arpu from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in arpu is primarily attributable to a decline in arpu for our access services due to increased use of free months of service and promotional pricing to obtain or retain pay access accounts 
we anticipate that the average number of communications pay accounts will continue to decline due to decreases in pay access accounts 
we also may experience further declines in arpu primarily as a result of discounted prices for extended service commitments on our access services  including providing our accelerated access services at for a one year commitment 
as a result of these factors  the rate of decline in communications billable services revenues has been increasing and may continue to increase  at least in the near term 
content media billable services revenues 
content media billable services revenues consist of fees charged to pay accounts for social networking  web hosting and other services  with substantially all generated from social networking 
content media billable services revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in content media billable services revenues was due to a increase in our average number of pay accounts from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  substantially all of this increase was associated with growth in our social networking pay accounts primarily as a result of organic growth and  to a lesser extent  the acquisition of pay accounts associated with the names database business in march  which had approximately  pay accounts at the time of the acquisition 
additionally  content media billable services revenues increased due to a increase in arpu from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in arpu is attributable to an increase in arpu for our social networking services due to a greater percentage of those pay accounts represented by higher priced  shorter term pay service plans  partially offset by decreases in arpu for our web hosting and online photo sharing services 
we expect content media billable services revenues to grow sequentially at a faster rate in the march quarter versus the growth rate we experienced in the december quarter 
advertising revenues we connect advertisers to consumers through a variety of online marketing initiatives integrated throughout our services and web properties  including advertising and search placements  email campaigns and user registration placements

the majority of the costs that comprise our communications cost of revenues are variable 
as such  our communications cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues is highly dependent on our arpu  our average hourly telecommunications cost and usage  and our average customer billing and support costs per pay account 
although the costs that comprise our content media cost of revenues were relatively fixed in the past  as a result of our loyalty marketing service which was acquired in april  these costs have become more variable and have increased significantly as a percentage of revenues 
consolidated cost of revenues 
consolidated cost of revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with our content media segment as well as a million increase in depreciation and a million increase in stock based compensation in connection with the adoption of sfas no

these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in costs associated with our voip service and a million increase in network and other overhead related costs 
as a percentage of communications revenues  communications cost of revenues increased to in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december   primarily as a result of voip cost of revenues exceeding voip revenues

content media cost of revenues

as a percentage of content media revenues  content media cost of revenues increased to in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december  due to loyalty marketing cost of revenues comprising a larger percentage of revenues than our other content media properties 
we anticipate that content media cost of revenues as a percentage of content media revenues will increase as a result of the loyalty marketing acquisition and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on increases or decreases in advertising revenue  which can be impacted by seasonality and other factors

provision for income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded a tax provision of million on pre tax income of million  resulting in a year to date effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to stock based compensation that is limited under section m of the internal revenue code the code  foreign losses  the benefit of which is not currently recognizable due to uncertainty regarding realization  and the re measurement of net deferred tax assets in new york

content media cost of revenues 
content media cost of revenues increased by million to million  or of content media revenues  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of content media revenues  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to costs associated with the acquisition of classmates in the december quarter  and to a lesser extent  increased costs associated with our web hosting service 
sales and marketing consolidated sales and marketing expenses 
consolidated sales and marketing expenses increased by million  or  to million  or of consolidated revenues  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of consolidated revenues  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in marketing expenses related to our content media segment  partially offset by a reduction in marketing expenses related to our communications segment 
the increase was also due to a million increase in stock based compensation in connection with the issuance of rsus during sales and marketing expenses related to our communications segment and our content media segment constituted and  respectively  of total segment sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  versus and  respectively  for the year ended december  communications sales and marketing expenses 
communications sales and marketing expenses decreased by million  or  to million  or of communications revenues  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of communications revenues  for the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to a million decline in advertising  promotion and distribution costs related to our access services  the majority of which was due to reductions in media and other advertising costs  and a million decrease in personnel and overhead related expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in voip marketing expenses 
content media sales and marketing expenses 
content media sales and marketing expenses increased by million to million  or of content media revenues  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of content media revenues  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to a million increase in expenses related to promoting our classmates social networking service and a million increase in personnel and overhead related costs associated with the acquisition of our classmates social networking service in the december quarter 
product development consolidated product development expenses 
consolidated product development expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to increases in expenses in the content media segment and  to a lesser extent  increases in expenses in the communications segment  as well as a million increase in depreciation and a million increase in stock based compensation in connection with the issuance of rsus during product development expenses related to our communications segment and our content media segment constituted and  respectively  of total segment product development expenses for the year ended december   compared to and  respectively  for the year ended december  communications product development expenses

the majority of the capitalized compensation costs in the year ended december  related to the development of our voip service and the new version of our accelerator service 
content media product development expenses 
content media product development expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs associated with the acquisition of classmates in the december quarter 
general and administrative consolidated general and administrative expenses 
consolidated general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increases in expenses in the content media segment and  to a lesser extent  increases in expenses in the communications segment  partially offset by a decrease in unallocated corporate expenses 
additionally  the increase was due to a million increase in stock based compensation in connection with the issuance of rsus during and a million increase in depreciation 
general and administrative expenses related to our communications segment and our content media segment constituted and  respectively  of total segment general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   compared to and  respectively  for the year ended december  communications general and administrative expenses

unallocated corporate expenses 
excluding stock based compensation and depreciation  unallocated corporate general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was the result of million in facility exit costs recognized in the year ended december  and a million decrease in facilities and other overhead related expenses  offset by a million increase in consulting fees and a million increase in compensation costs 
amortization of intangible assets at december   we had approximately million in net identifiable intangible assets resulting primarily from the acquisitions of classmates  bluelight internet assets and the web hosting and photo sharing services 
at december   we had approximately million in goodwill resulting from the acquisitions of classmates and the web hosting and photo sharing services 
in accordance with the provisions set forth in sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not being amortized but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value amount 
we determined that our goodwill and long lived assets were not impaired based on our annual test during the years ended december  and amortization of intangible assets increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increases are due to the amortization of identifiable intangible assets from our acquisitions of classmates and the photo sharing service  offset partially by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets from the merger 
we recorded a reduction in the remaining intangible assets from the merger of approximately million during the december quarter in connection with the release of the deferred tax valuation allowance 
in addition  the increase was related to the amortization of identifiable intangible assets throughout from the acquisition of our web hosting services in april certain of the acquired intangible assets are amortized on an accelerated basis to better match the expense to the expected cash flows from those assets 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as a result of higher interest rates and higher average balances on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
net realized gains on our short term investments were not significant for the year ended december  net realized gains on our short term investments were approximately million for the year ended december  interest expense interest expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of interest on the outstanding balance on the term loan  which was issued in december in january  we repaid the remaining balance of million on the term loan 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded a tax provision of million on pre tax income of million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to compensation  including stock based compensation  that was limited under section m of the code  foreign losses  the benefit of which is not currently recognizable due to uncertainty regarding realization  and the re measurement of net deferred tax assets  including a change in new york state tax law 
this re measurement resulted in an increase to the tax provision for the year ended december  by approximately million  or 
for the year ended december   we recorded a tax benefit of million on pre tax income of million  resulting in an effective tax rate benefit of 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the release of substantially all of the balance of the valuation allowance attributable to the expected utilization of net deferred tax assets in the future 
liquidity and capital resources our total cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances decreased by million  or  to million at december   compared to million at december  our summary cash flows for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash provided by used for financing activities year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non cash items  including depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets  deferred taxes and tax benefits from stock options and changes in working capital 
the year over year decrease was primarily the result of the following a million increase in other items including a million increase in cash paid for legal settlements and a million increase in net amortization on short term investments  and a million net decrease in working capital accounts  including a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  a million decrease in deferred revenue primarily due to decreases in pay access accounts  a million decrease in other liabilities  a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in other assets 
these decreases in working capital were partially offset by a million increase in member redemption liability related to mypoints 
the negative impact on working capital from the change in accounts payable and accrued liability balances was due to a million year over year reduction in the change in income taxes payable  a million year over year reduction in the change in accrued employee bonuses due to the timing of bonus payments  including the payment of bonuses associated with the mypoints acquisition  a million year over year reduction in the change in sales and marketing accruals primarily due to a reduction in media and other advertising costs associated with our communications segment  and a net year over year reduction in other payables and accrued liabilities primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors 
net cash used for investing activities increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of the following a million increase in cash paid for acquisitions 
we acquired mypoints in april for million  net of cash acquired  the names database in march for million  net of cash acquired  and we paid the remaining million due in connection with the acquisition of our photo sharing service in march compared to the initial payment of million in march  a million net decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of short term investments  a million escrow deposit for the settlement of a pre acquisition liability in the september quarter  and a million increase in purchases of property and equipment 
these increases in uses of cash were partially offset by a million decrease in purchases of rights  patents and trademarks  primarily related to the purchase of proprietary rights associated with the netzero trademark for million  million of which was paid in the march quarter 
the remaining million was paid in january we have invested significantly in our network infrastructure  software licenses  leasehold improvements  and computer equipment and we will need to make further significant investments in the future 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million 
we anticipate that our total capital expenditures for will be in the range of million to million 
the actual amount of future capital expenditures may fluctuate due to a number of factors including  without limitation  potential future acquisitions and new business initiatives  which are difficult to predict and could change significantly over time 
additionally  technological advances may require us to make capital expenditures to develop or acquire new equipment or technology in order to replace aging or technologically obsolete equipment 
net cash used for financing activities increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of the following a million increase in dividend payments  and an million increase in payments on the term loan 
in january  we paid  in full  the outstanding balance of the term loan of approximately million 
the increases in uses of cash were offset by an million decrease in repurchases of common stock  a million increase in proceeds from exercises of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan  and a million increase in excess tax benefits from stock based compensation as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  which requires a portion of the tax benefits from stock based compensation to be presented in financing activities versus its historical presentation in operating activities 
the payment of dividends will negatively impact cash flows from financing activities 
in  our board of directors declared and paid quarterly cash dividends of per share of common stock for a total of million 
in february  our board of directors declared and paid a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock totaling million 
the payment of future dividends is discretionary and will be subject to determination by the board of directors each quarter following its review of our financial performance 
future cash flows from financing activities may also be affected by repurchases of common stock 
our board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program that allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock through open market or privately negotiated transactions based on prevailing market conditions and other factors through december  at december   we had repurchased million of our common stock under the program  and the remaining available under the program was million 
cash flows from financing activities may also be negatively impacted by the withholding of a portion of shares underlying the rsus we award to employees 
upon vesting  we currently anticipate that we will not collect the applicable withholding taxes for rsus from employees 
instead  we will automatically withhold  from the rsus that vest  the portion of those shares with a fair market value equal to the amount of the withholding taxes due 
we will then pay the applicable withholding taxes in cash 
similar to repurchases of common stock  the net effect of such withholding will adversely impact our cash flows 
the amount remitted in the year ended december  was million for which we withheld approximately  shares of common stock that were underlying the rsus 
the amount we pay in future quarters will vary based on our stock price and the number of rsus vesting during the quarter 
based on our current projections  we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations  at least in the near term 
we intend to use our existing cash balances and future cash generated from operations to fund dividend payments  if declared by the board  to develop and acquire complementary services  businesses or technologies  to repurchase shares of our common stock if we believe market conditions to be favorable  to repurchase the common stock underlying rsus and pay the withholding taxes due on vested rsus  and to fund future capital expenditures 
we currently anticipate that our future cash flows from operations and existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances will be sufficient to fund our operations over the next year  and in the near term we do not anticipate the need for additional financing to fund our operations 
however  we may raise additional debt or equity capital for a variety of reasons including  without limitation  developing new or enhancing existing services or products  repurchasing our common stock  acquiring complementary services  businesses or technologies or funding significant capital expenditures 
if we need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements  it might not be available to us in a timely manner  on acceptable terms  or at all 
our failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows  and could impair our ability to pay dividends 
if additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of stock owned by the then current stockholders would be reduced 
furthermore  such equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to holders of our common stock 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non cash items  including depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  deferred taxes and tax benefits from stock options  and changes in working capital 
the year over year increase was primarily the result of a million net increase in working capital accounts due to increases in revenues and operating expenses and the timing of related cash receipts and payments  including an million increase in income taxes payable 
net cash used for investing activities decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of the following a million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily the result of the classmates acquisition for million in cash  net of cash acquired  in november  and a million net increase in proceeds from maturities and sales of short term investments in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in capital equipment purchases and capitalized software costs in connection with the development of new products and the ongoing operations of our business  and a million increase in purchases of rights  patents and trademarks  primarily related to the purchase of proprietary rights associated with the netzero trademark for million  million of which was paid in the march quarter 
the remaining million was paid in january net cash used for financing activities increased by million for the year ended december  to million compared to million net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of the following the borrowing of million in december through a four year term loan facility  payments of million on the term loan in the year ended december   including voluntary prepayments of million 
in january  we paid  in full  the outstanding balance of the term loan of approximately million  and payments of million for dividends in the year ended december  the increases were offset by a million decrease in repurchases of common stock in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in may  august and october of  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock 
the quarterly dividends were paid on may   august  and november  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
financial commitments our financial commitments were as follows at december  in thousands year ending december  contractual obligations total thereafter capital leases operating leases telecommunications purchases media purchases total includes of imputed interest 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap including those for interim financial information and with the instructions for form k and article of regulation s x issued by the securities and exchange commission sec 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the results of operations for interim or transition periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for a full year 
the following is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that we believe are most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  financial position and results of operations and which require complex management judgments  uncertainties and or estimates 
revenue recognition we apply the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab no 
outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies 
in general  we recognize revenue related to our billable services and advertising products when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the fee is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we also apply the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
billable services revenues are recognized in the period in which fees are fixed or determinable and the related products or services are provided to the user 
our pay accounts generally pay in advance for their service by credit card  and revenue is then recognized ratably over the period in which the related services are provided 
advance payments from subscribers are recorded on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
we offer alternative payment methods to credit cards for certain pay service plans 
these alternative payment methods currently include ach  payment by personal check or money order or through a local telephone company 
in circumstances where payment is not received in advance  revenue is only recognized if collectibility is reasonably assured 
advertising revenues consist primarily of fees from internet search partners that are generated as a result of users utilizing partner internet search services  fees generated by users viewing and clicking on third party web site banners and text link advertisements  fees generated by enabling customer registrations for partners and fees from referring users to  or from users making purchases on  sponsors web sites 
revenues are recognized provided that no significant obligations remain  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
we recognize banner advertising and sponsorship revenues in the periods in which the advertisement or sponsorship placement is displayed  based upon the lesser of i impressions delivered divided by the total number of guaranteed impressions or ii ratably over the period in which the advertisement is displayed 
our obligations typically include a minimum number of impressions or the satisfaction of other performance criteria 
revenue from performance based arrangements  including referral revenues  is recognized as the related performance criteria are met 
in determining whether an arrangement exists  we ensure that a binding contract is in place  such as a standard insertion order or a fully executed customer specific agreement 
we assess whether performance criteria have been met and whether the fees are fixed or determinable based on a reconciliation of the performance criteria and the payment terms associated with the transaction 
the reconciliation of the performance criteria generally includes a comparison of internally tracked performance data to the contractual performance obligation and to third party or customer performance data in circumstances where that data is available 
probability of collection is assessed based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured  revenue is not recognized until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
our mypoints subsidiary earns revenue primarily from corporate advertising customers by charging fees for sending emails to the mypoints members and placing advertising on the mypoints web site 
under the terms of advertising contracts  mypoints earns revenue primarily based on three components transmission of email advertisements to enrolled members  unique clicks on transmitted emails and actual transactions by members over the internet 
revenue is recognized when email is transmitted to members  when responses are received and when members complete online transactions 
each of these activities is a discrete  independent activity  which generally is specified in the advertising sales agreement entered into with the customer 
as the earning activities take place  activity measurement data eg  number of emails delivered and number of responses received is accumulated and the related revenue is recorded 
revenue from the sale of points to mypoints advertisers is deferred over a fifteen month period  which is the expected time that either the points are redeemed and mypoints provides a reward  or the points expire prior to redemption 
revenue is also deferred if mypoints has performed under the contract and has billed for its services  but the collection of the receivable is not reasonably assured 
in such case  revenue is recognized once the collection of the cash is no longer in doubt 
also  deferred revenue represents invoiced services that have not yet been performed 
long lived assets we account for long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposition of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets  other than indefinite life intangible assets  for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
events and circumstances that may indicate that an asset is impaired include significant decreases in the market value of an asset  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations  a change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period  shifts in technology  loss of key management or personnel  changes in our operating model or strategy and competitive forces 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired net assets 
we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which among other things  addresses financial accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be carried at cost  prohibits the amortization of goodwill and requires us to test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
we perform an impairment test of our goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or when events and circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that goodwill might be permanently impaired 
events or circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations 
the testing for a potential impairment of goodwill involves a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair values of our reporting units with their respective book values  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value exceeds book value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary 
if  however  the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value  then the carrying amount of the goodwill is compared with its implied fair value 
the estimate of implied fair value of goodwill may require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as our pay account base  software and technology and patents and trademarks 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
business combinations all of our acquisitions have been accounted for as purchase business combinations 
under the purchase method of accounting  the cost  including transaction costs  is allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly impact net income 
consequently  to the extent an indefinite lived or a longer lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter lived asset  there may be less amortization recorded in a given period 
definite lived identifiable intangible assets are amortized on either a straight line basis or an accelerated basis 
we determine the appropriate amortization method by performing an analysis of expected cash flows over the estimated useful life of the asset and matches the amortization expense to the expected cash flows from those assets 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
two areas  in particular  that require significant judgment are estimating the fair value and related useful lives of identifiable intangible assets 
to assist in this process  we may obtain appraisals from valuation specialists for certain intangible assets 
while there are a number of different methods used in estimating the value of acquired intangibles  there are two approaches primarily used the discounted cash flow and market comparison approaches 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the two approaches include projected future cash flows including timing  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  subscriber churn and terminal value  determination of appropriate market comparables  and the determination of whether a premium or a discount should be applied to comparables 
most of the above assumptions are made based on available historical information 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the computation of limitations relating to the amount of such tax assets  and the determination of appropriate valuation allowances relating to realizability of such assets  are inherently complex and require the exercise of judgment 
as additional information becomes available  we continually assess the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we record liabilities related to pending litigation when an unfavorable outcome is probable and management can reasonably estimate the amount of loss 
we have not recorded liabilities for certain pending litigation because of the uncertainties related to assessing both the amount and the probable outcome of those claims 
as additional information becomes available  we continually assesses the potential liability related to all pending litigation 
recent accounting pronouncements accounting changes and errors in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
apb opinion no 
previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
when it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects of an accounting change on one or more individual prior periods presented  sfas no 
requires that the new accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in an income statement 
when it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of applying a change in accounting principle to all prior periods  sfas no 
requires that the new accounting principle be applied as if it were adopted prospectively from the earliest date practicable 
in addition  sfas no 
makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made beginning in the march quarter 
the implementation of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
this interpretation requires that we recognize in the consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin will be effective for us beginning in the march quarter  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
while our analysis of the impact of this interpretation is not yet complete  we do not anticipate it will have a material impact on our retained earnings at the time of adoption 
effects of prior year misstatements in september  the sec issued sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  in order to address the observed diversity in quantification practices with respect to annual financial statements 
there have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement errors the roll over method and the iron curtain method 
the roll over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement  including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements  but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method  on the other hand  focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement 
in sab no 
 the sec staff establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of the error on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it essentially requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the roll over methods 
from a transition perspective  sab no 
permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach in the first year ending after november  by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
additionally  the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose 
these disclosures are intended to make prior years materiality judgments easier for investors and others to assess 
assuming that a company has properly applied its previous approach to evaluating financial statement misstatements  the sec staff has indicated that it will not object if the company does not restate financial statements for fiscal years ending on or before november  the implementation of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which clarifies the definition of fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements and eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas no 
will be effective for us on january  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
on our financial position  cash flows  and results of operations 
fair value option in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
sfas no 
will be effective for us on january  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
on our financial position  cash flows  and results of operations 
inflation inflation did not have a material impact during the years ended december   and  and we do not currently anticipate that inflation will have a material impact on our results of operations for fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business  principally risk associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk we have interest rate risk primarily related to our investment portfolio 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting of us commercial paper  us government or us government agency obligations  municipal obligations  auction rate securities and money market funds 
our primary objective is the preservation of principal and liquidity while maximizing yield 
the minimum long term rating is a  and if a long term rating is not available  we require a short term credit rating of a and p the value of these investments may fluctuate with changes in interest rates 
however  we believe this risk is immaterial due to the relatively short term nature of the investments 
foreign currency risk we transact business in different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the indian rupee inr and the euro  which may result in a gain or loss of earnings to us 
the volatility of the inr and the euro and all other applicable currencies are monitored throughout the year 
we face two risks related to foreign currency exchange translation risk and transaction risk 
amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars using period end exchange rates 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the us dollar 
since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are denominated in the local currency of our subsidiaries  the foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as a component of stockholders equity and do not impact operating results 
revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies 
therefore  changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations 
currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in operating expenses 
while we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging  we may in the future use hedging programs  currency forward contracts  currency options and or other derivative financial instruments commonly utilized to reduce financial market risks if it is determined that such hedging activities are appropriate to reduce risk
