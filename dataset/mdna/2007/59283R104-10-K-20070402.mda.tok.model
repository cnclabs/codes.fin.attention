each restaurant contributes an agreed upon percentage of its sales to the funds 
critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that the company believes are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and also require its most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that is involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment 
the company records all property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and it selects useful lives that reflect the actual economic lives of the underlying assets 
the company amortizes leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the related lease term 
it calculates depreciation using the straight line method for financial statement purposes 
the company capitalizes improvements and expense repairs and maintenance costs as incurred 
it is often required to exercise judgment in its decision whether to capitalize an asset or expense an expenditure that is for maintenance and repairs 
the company s judgments may produce materially different amounts of repair and maintenance or depreciation expense if different assumptions were used 
the company periodically performs asset impairment analysis of property and equipment related to its restaurant locations 
it performs these tests when it experiences a triggering event such as a major change in a location s operating environment  or other event that might impact its ability to recover its asset investment 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
also  the company has a policy of reviewing the financial operations of its restaurant locations on at least a quarterly basis 
locations that do not meet expectations are identified and monitored closely throughout the year 
primarily in the fourth quarter  the company reviews actual results and analyze budgets for the ensuing year 
if it deems that a location s results will continue to be below expectations  it will evaluate alternatives for its continued operation 
at that time  the company will perform an asset impairment test 
if it determines that the asset s carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows  it will record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its fair value 
calculation of fair value requires significant estimates and judgments which could vary significantly based on its assumptions 
upon an event such as a formal decision for abandonment restaurant closure  the company may record additional impairment charges 
any carryover basis of assets will be depreciated over the respective remaining useful lives 
goodwill 
goodwill and other indefinite lived assets resulted primarily from the company s acquisition of franchisee owned restaurants 
the most significant acquisitions were completed in   and goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization 
however  such assets must be tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and at least annually 
the company completed the most recent impairment test in december  and determined that there were no impairment losses related to goodwill and other indefinite lived assets 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite lived assets  market values and projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are used to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
the estimated future cash flows were projected using significant assumptions  including future revenues and expenses 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
leasing activities 
the company leases all of its restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  the company evaluates each property and classifies the lease as an operating or capital lease in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
it exercises significant judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the restaurant as well as the discount rate used to discount the minimum future lease payments 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can reasonably be assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
all of the company s restaurant leases are classified as operating leases 
the company s lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date it takes possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in its rent holiday period which begins on the possession date and ends on the store open date 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally include construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater rent expensed during the rent holiday period 
the company records contingent rent expense based on a percentage of restaurant sales  which exceeds minimum base rent  over the periods the liability is incurred 
the contingent rent expense is recorded prior to achievement of specified sales levels if achievement of such amounts is considered probable and estimable 
income taxes 
the company provides for income taxes based on its estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
these estimates consider  among other items  effective rates for state and local income taxes  allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported tip income  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items  the company s estimates are based on the information available to it at the time it prepares the income tax provisions 
the company generally files its annual income tax returns several months after its fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state  and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future income tax consequences of carryforwards and temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets that arc deemed more likely than not to be realized in the near term 
the company must assess the likelihood that it will be able to recover its deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  the company establishes valuation allowances to offset any deferred tax asset recorded 
the valuation allowance is based on its estimates of future taxable income in each jurisdiction in which it operates  tax planning strategies  and the period over which its deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  the company may be unable to implement certain tax planning strategies or adjust these estimates in future periods 
as the company updates its estimates  it may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could have a material negative impact on its results of operations or financial position  or it could reduce its valuation allowances which would have a favorable impact on its results of operations or financial position 
stock based compensation 
the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards revised  share based payment sfas r 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model and is affected by assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the actual and projected employee and director stock option exercise behavior 
the use of an option pricing model also requires the use of a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends  and expected term 
expected volatility is based on the company s historical volatility 
the company utilizes historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
sfas r also requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise these estimates  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the company estimates forfeitures based on its expectation of future experience while considering its historical experience 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of earnings 
the company is also required to establish deferred tax assets for expense relating to options that would be expected to generate a tax deduction under their original terms 
the recoverability of such assets are dependent upon the actual deduction that may be available at exercise and can further be impaired by either the expiration of the option or an overall valuation reserve on deferred tax assets 
the company believes the estimates and assumptions related to these critical accounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances  however  should future events or occurrences result in unanticipated consequences  there could be a material impact on its future financial condition or results of operations 
impact of recently issued standards 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in addition  fin requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes and is effective for our first quarter of the fiscal year 
the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  that fin will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
clarifies the fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early adoption permitted 
the company has not yet determined the impact  if any  that the implementation of sfas no 
will have on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not have or participate in transactions involving derivative  financial and commodity instruments 
the company s long term debt bears interest at floating market rates  based upon either the prime rate or libor plus a stipulated percentage  and therefore it experiences changes in interest expense when market interest rates change 
based on amounts outstanding at year end  a change in interest rates would change interest expense by approximately
