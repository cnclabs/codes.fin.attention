competition the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and rapidly changing 
although we believe there is no single company that directly competes with our content authentication services and solutions  we are aware of efforts by other companies to develop products or services to either compete directly with our services and solutions or that could be used as alternatives to our offerings 
these companies offer fax products  web based processing of medical forms and signature solutions that could compete with our services and solutions

research and development the market for our software and services is characterized by rapid technological change involving the application of a number of advanced technologies  including those relating to computer hardware and software  communication technologies  mass storage devices  electronic signatures  content authentication and other related technologies 
our ability to be competitive depends upon our ability to anticipate and effectively react to technological changes  changing market conditions for our software and services  and the requirements of our customers

our product development activities are focused on enhancing our applications and services and developing new application and services to address customer and market needs

item a 
risk factors as provided for under the private securities litigation reform act of  we wish to caution shareholders and investors that the following important factors  among others discussed throughout this report on form k for the fiscal year ended june   have affected  and in some cases could affect  our actual results of operation and cause our results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements made herein 
our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected due to any of the following risks 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks 
in assessing these risks  you should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  including our financial statements and related notes 
risks related to our business failure to increase our revenue and keep our expenses consistent with revenues could prevent us from achieving and maintaining profitability 
we incurred net losses of approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
we have expended  and will continue to be required to expend  substantial funds to pursue product development projects  enhance our marketing and sales efforts and to otherwise operate our business 
therefore  we will need to generate higher revenues to achieve and maintain profitability and cannot assure you that we will be profitable in any future period 
our prospects should be considered in light of the difficulties frequently encountered in connection with the establishment of a new business line  which characterizes our business  such as the difficulty in creating a viable market  the significant related development and marketing costs and the overall competitive environment in which we operate 
this risk may be more acute in light of our disposition of our other operating segments 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitable operations in future operating periods 
our capital requirements are significant and we have historically financed our operations through private placements of securities 
our capital requirements have been and will continue to be significant 
we have been substantially dependent upon private placements of our securities and on short term and long term loans from lending institutions to fund such requirements 
we are expending significant amounts of capital to develop  promote and market our software and services  such as our inscrybe healthcare platform and related modules and our inscrybe office offering 
due to these expenditures  we have incurred significant losses to date 
we used approximately   and  in cash for continuing operating activities for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
we expect the proceeds received from our february private financing  in which we raised approximately  in net proceeds  and cash generated from operations and asset sales  to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future 
no assurances can be given that we will be able to attain sales levels and support our costs through revenues derived from operations 
if we are unable to attain projected revenue levels for our business  it may be necessary to raise additional capital to fund operations and to meet our obligations in the future 

table of contents if the united states postal service cancels our new license agreement  we may need to incur additional costs in our efforts to successfully commercialize this technology 
in july  we entered into a new three year license agreement with the us postal service usps to act as a non exclusive authorized service provider of the usps electronic postmark epm 
pursuant to this license agreement  the usps granted the company a non exclusive  worldwide license to use its applicable trademarks and other intellectual property rights for the epm service in order to enable us to offer the epm service directly to the market 
the usps will define and maintain the technical and operational standards for the epm service  and serve as backup verifier for all epm transactions 
authentidate is the first provider to be authorized in a new standards based epm service model created by the usps to help ensure performance standards and facilitate the development of a multi provider environment 
we have operated the epm service on behalf of the usps since march  under a strategic alliance agreement that expired on july  this license agreement is effective as of august  and will expire in three years unless it is sooner terminated in accordance with its terms 
either party may terminate the agreement upon written notice if the other party is in material breach of any provision thereof  subject to applicable cure periods 
in addition  either party may terminate this agreement for any reason  upon days notice to the other party 
the usps will also have the right to terminate the license agreement upon written notice in connection with a change in control transaction affecting authentidate 
no assurances can be given that the usps will not terminate this agreement which termination could adversely affect our ability to commercialize this technology 
our license with the usps may also be adversely affected by recently enacted legislation regarding the usps 
on december   the president signed into law pl this statute defines as postal services essentially the carriage of paper and printed matter  but grandfathers other services that were being offered by the usps as of january   which we believe would include the epm 
however  the legislation further directs the postal regulatory commission prc to review non postal services within two years to determine whether they should continue taking into account the public need for the service and the ability of the private sector to meet the public need for the service 
based upon this legislation  the prc may review the current licensing arrangement for the epm 
accordingly  there can be no assurance the usps will not terminate this licensing program  which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize this technology 
we depend on growth in the software as a service market  and lack of growth or contraction in this market could materially adversely affect our sales and financial condition 
our software and internet solutions compete with other software as a service solutions 
demand for our solutions and software offerings is driven by several factors  including an increased focus on protecting business critical applications  government and industry regulations requiring data protection and integrity  and the growth in the market for software as a service 
segments of the computer and software industry have in the past experienced significant economic downturns and decreases in demand as a result of changing market factors 
a change in the market factors that are driving demand for offerings of software as a service could adversely affect our sales  profitability and financial condition 
we have been named as a party to several class action and derivative action lawsuits  and we may be named in additional litigation  all of which could require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses 
an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as described in detail at item legal proceedings of part i of this report on form k  several purported class action complaints were filed in federal court alleging that we and certain of our current and former officers and directors violated the federal securities laws 
subsequently  four purported shareholder derivative actions were filed against certain current and former officers and directors based on allegations substantially similar to those set forth in the purported class actions 
the expense of defending such litigation 
table of contents may be substantial and the time required to defend the actions could divert management s attention from the day to day operations of our business  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and cash flows 
our success is dependent on the performance of our management and the cooperation  performance and retention of our executive officers and key employees 
our business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our senior management team and executive officers 
if our management team is unable to perform it may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executive officers 
the loss of one or several key employees could seriously harm our business 
any reorganization or reduction in the size of our employee base could harm our ability to attract and retain other valuable employees critical to the success of our business 
if we lose key personnel or fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully  our ability to manage our business could be impaired 
our future success depends upon the continued service of our key management  technical  sales  finance  and other critical personnel 
other than our ceo  cfo and the president of our german operation  our key personnel do not have employment agreements and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them 
key personnel have left our company in the past and there likely will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time in the future 
the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations  including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases  the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives  the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting  and the results of our operations 
in addition  hiring  training  and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming  may cause additional disruptions to our operations  and may be unsuccessful  which could negatively impact future revenues 
our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 
for example  accounting for employee stock options under fas r has had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
as a result of the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act and the review of accounting policies by the sec and national and international accounting standards bodies  the frequency of accounting policy changes may accelerate 
for example  the adoption of fas r in fiscal required us to adopt a different method of determining and accounting for the compensation expense of our employee stock options 
as a result of the adoption of fas r  our losses during fiscal and were higher than they would have been had we not been required to adopt fas r 
this will continue to be the case for future periods 
this and other possible changes to accounting standards  could adversely affect our reported results of operations 
further  accounting policies affecting software revenue recognition have been the subject of frequent interpretations  which could significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products 
as we enhance  expand and diversify our business and product offerings  the application of existing or future financial accounting standards  particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue  could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 
if the carrying value of our long lived assets is not recoverable  an impairment loss must be recognized which would adversely affect our financial results 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill  acquired product rights  and other intangible assets  whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that these assets might be impaired 
goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment at the end of each fiscal year  regardless of events and 
table of contents circumstances 
in fiscal we recorded an impairment charge of approximately  for goodwill and other long term intangible assets 
as of june   we had approximately  of goodwill principally from our acquisition of our german subsidiary  authentidate international  ag 
we will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long lived assets  and we may incur substantial impairment charges  which could adversely affect our financial results 
we have incurred significant additional costs concerning our international operations and may incur additional costs in the future 
we have incurred substantial costs in supporting the operation of our german subsidiary  authentidate international  ag 
in june  we entered into a new one year employment agreement with mr 
jan wendenburg  the chief executive officer of authentidate international  pursuant to which he received a base salary of approximately   euros 
further  for the fiscal years ended june   and  we advanced or made capital investments of approximately  to this subsidiary 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will recoup any of these amounts from this subsidiary 
we expect to incur additional costs in the future in connection with the operations of this subsidiary 
developing and implementing new or updated software and services may take longer and cost more than expected 
we rely on a combination of internal development  strategic relationships  licensing and acquisitions to develop our software and services 
the cost of developing new software and services  such as inscrybe healthcare and related modules and inscrybe office  is inherently difficult to estimate 
our development and implementation of proposed software and services may take longer than originally expected  require more testing than originally anticipated and require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources 
if we are unable to develop new or updated software and services on a timely basis and implement them without significant disruptions to the existing systems and processes of our customers  we may lose potential revenues and harm our relationships with current or potential customers 
new or updated software and services will not become profitable unless they achieve sufficient levels of market acceptance  which may require significant efforts and costs 
there can be no assurance that customers and potential customers will accept from us new or updated software and services 
the future results of our business will depend  in significant part  on the success of our software and services 
current and potential customers may choose to use similar products and services offered by our competitors or may not purchase new or updated software or services  especially when they are initially offered and if they require changes in equipment or workflow 
for software and services we are developing or may develop in the future  there can be no assurance that we will attract sufficient customers or that such software and services will generate sufficient revenues to cover the costs of developing  marketing and providing such software and services 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any pricing strategy that we implement for any new software and services will be economically viable or acceptable to the target markets 
failure to achieve broad penetration in target markets with respect to new or updated software and services could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects 
further  achieving market acceptance for new or updated software and services is likely to require substantial marketing efforts and expenditure of significant funds to create awareness and demand by potential customers 
we do not have patents on all the technology we use  which could harm our competitive position 
on may   we were issued our first us patent and we also have seven issued foreign patents 
in addition  we have nine us and nine foreign patent applications pending relating to the technology and business processes underlying our services and applications 
however  some of the technology embodied in some of our current products cannot be patented 
we have registered the trademarks authentidate and carecert in the 
table of contents us  the trademark authentidate in germany and in the european community and a number of other trademarks as madrid protocol international registrations 
we have also sought to register a number of additional trademarks in the us and certain foreign markets  including inscrybe  myinscrybe and inscrybe office 
we continue to take steps to protect our intellectual property rights including filing additional trademark and patent applications where appropriate 
we rely on confidentiality agreements with our key employees to the extent we deem it to be necessary 
we further intend to file patent applications for any new products we may develop  to the extent that we believe that any technology included in such products is patentable 
there can be no assurance that any patents in fact  will be issued or that any such patents that do issue will be effective to protect our products and services from duplication by other manufacturers or developers or to prevent our competitors from offering similar products and services 
other companies operating within our business segments may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or otherwise obtain access to our know how  much of which is maintained as trade secrets 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to afford the expense of any litigation which may be necessary to enforce our rights under any patent 
although we believe that the products we sell do not and will not infringe upon the patents or violate the proprietary rights of others  it is possible that such infringement or violation has occurred or may occur 
on august   we became aware of an action filed against us entitled timecertain llc vs 
authentidate holding corporation  authentidate  inc and ncipher inc 
the plaintiff in this matter had claimed that our products and systems incorporating secure time stamping technology  including but not limited to the usps electronic postmark system  infringes certain of its patent rights 
this matter has resulted in a favorable settlement for the company in which all of the plaintiff s claims were dismissed with prejudice and the case terminated for additional information  see item  legal proceedings 
we have investigated patents held by third parties of which we are aware and believe that our products and services do not infringe on the claims of these patents 
although we have not received notice of any other claims that our products or services are infringing  we can not provide any assurances that our products and services do not infringe upon any third party patents  including the patents we have investigated 
as described under the caption legal proceedings  we are currently defending a claim by shore venture group  in which it alleges  among other things  rights under one or more of our patent applications 
shore venture group recently withdrew a number of claims in the arbitration  including a claim for damages in connection with an alleged copyright infringement 
prior to the commencement of this case  we had conducted extensive settlement negotiations with shore venture in an effort to resolve all claims between the parties 
the case which was brought in federal court has been stayed in favor of arbitration 
on october   shore venture filed a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association 
on december  we filed a response to the demand and are defending this action vigorously 
discovery has closed in this matter and an arbitration hearing is scheduled to begin on september  in the event that products we sell or services we provide are deemed to infringe upon the patents or proprietary rights of others  we could be required to modify our products and or services or obtain a license for the manufacture  use and or sale of such products and services 
there can be no assurance that  in such an event  we would be able to do so in a timely manner  upon acceptable terms and conditions  or at all  and the failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect upon our business 
moreover  there can be no assurance that we will have the financial or other resources necessary to defend against a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation action 
in addition  if our products  services or proposed products or services are deemed to infringe upon the patents or proprietary rights of others  we could  under certain circumstances  become liable for damages or subject to an injunction  which could also have a material adverse effect on our business 
because we derive a majority of our revenues from a few software and service offerings  any decline in demand for these offerings could severely harm our ability to generate revenues 
we derive a majority of our revenues from a limited number of software and service offerings 
in addition  our focus on building our business is concentrated on markets for software and services where content integrity  workflow automation  electronic signatures and time and date stamping are important to customers 
as a result  we are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in demand for these offerings  whether as a result of competition  
table of contents product obsolescence  technological change  customer spending  or other factors 
if our revenues derived from our software and service offerings were to decline significantly  our business and operating results would be adversely affected 
additionally  for the year ended june  we reported that two customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
as a result  if our relationships with these or other significant customers were disrupted we could lose a significant percentage of our anticipated revenues which could have material adverse effect on our business 
some of our software and service offerings have long and unpredictable sales cycles  which may impact our quarterly operating results 
transactions for some of our software and service offerings require customers to undertake customized installations to integrate the solutions into their legacy systems and require them to modify existing business practices 
the period from our initial contact with a potential customer until the execution of an agreement is difficult to predict and can be in excess of six months 
the sales cycles for these transactions can be long and unpredictable due to a number of uncertainties such as customers budgetary constraints  the need to educate potential customers about our software and service offerings  the timing of customers budget cycles  delays caused by customers internal review processes  customers willingness to invest resources and modify their network infrastructures to take advantage of our offerings  and for sales to government customers  governmental regulatory  approval and purchasing requirements 
we are unable to control or influence many of these factors 
further  we have experienced delays in the pace of adoption and use by our customers of our transaction based offerings  such as inscrybe healthcare  which has adversely affected our earnings 
we may experience similar delays with inscrybe office as well 
during the sales cycle and the implementation period  we may expend substantial time  effort and money preparing contract proposals  negotiating contracts and implementing solutions without receiving any related revenue 
in addition  many of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  including personnel costs and technology and infrastructure costs 
accordingly  our inability to generate sufficient revenues from these offerings has a direct impact on our results of operations 
the failure to properly manage our growth could cause our business to lose money 
we are expanding our sales and marketing efforts in order to develop and pursue existing and potential market opportunities 
this growth is expected to place a significant demand on management and operational resources 
in order to manage growth effectively  we must implement and improve our operational systems and controls on a timely basis 
if we fail to implement these systems and controls  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be materially and adversely affected 
our software and web based services and web site may be subject to intentional disruption 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions  such as software viruses specifically designed to impede the performance of our software and web based services  we may be affected by such efforts in the future 
further  despite the implementation of security measures  this infrastructure or other systems that we interface with  including the internet and related systems  may be vulnerable to physical break ins  hackers  improper employee or contractor access  programming errors  attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems  resulting in the potential misappropriation of our proprietary information or interruptions of our services 
any compromise of our security  whether as a result of our own systems or systems that they interface with  could substantially disrupt our operations  harm our reputation and reduce demand for our services 

table of contents performance problems with our systems or system failures could cause us to lose business or incur liabilities 
our customer satisfaction and our business could be harmed if we experience transmission delays or failures or loss of data in the systems we use to provide services to our customers  including transaction related services 
these systems are complex and  despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that problems will not occur or that they will be detected and corrected promptly if they do occur 
in providing these services  we rely on internal systems as well as communications and hosting services provided by third parties  such as the internet 
to operate without interruption  both we and the service providers we use must guard against damage from fire  power loss and other natural disasters  communications failures  software and hardware errors  failures or crashes  security breaches  computer viruses and similar disruptive problems  and other potential interruptions 
we have experienced periodic system interruptions in the past  and we cannot guarantee that they will not occur again 
in the event of a catastrophic event at one of our data centers or any third party facility we use  we may experience an extended period of system unavailability  which could negatively impact our business 
further  if such an event caused the loss of stored data  it could have a material adverse impact on our business or cause us to incur material liabilities 
although we maintain insurance for our business  we cannot guarantee that our insurance will be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur or that this coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts 
in addition  some of our web based services may  at times  be required to accommodate higher than expected volumes of traffic 
at those times  we may experience slower response times or system failures 
any sustained or repeated interruptions or disruptions in these systems or slow down in their response times could damage our relationships with customers 
further  the internet has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and the amount of traffic 
if the internet continues to experience increased usage  the internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it which could harm its reliability and performance 
any significant interruptions in our services or increases in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users of services and  if sustained or repeated  could reduce the attractiveness of our services 
our software and service offerings may not be accepted by the market  which would seriously harm our business 
demand and market acceptance for our software and service offerings remain subject to a high level of uncertainty 
achieving widespread acceptance of these offerings will continue to require substantial marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant funds to create and maintain brand recognition and customer demand for such offerings 
demand for our software and services depend on  among other things the perceived ability of our offerings to address real customer problems  the perceived quality  price  ease of use and interoperability of our offerings as compared to our competitors offerings  the market s perception of how easy or difficult it is to deploy our software or services  especially in complex  network environments  the continued evolution of electronic commerce as a viable means of conducting business  market acceptance and use of new technologies and standards  
table of contents the ability of network infrastructures to support an increasing number of users and services  the pace of technological change and our ability to keep up with these changes  and general economic conditions  which influence how much money our customers and potential customers are willing to allocate to their information technology budgets 
there can be no assurance that adequate marketing arrangements will be made and continued for our software and services and there can be no assurance that any of these offerings will ever achieve or maintain widespread market acceptance or that such offerings will be profitable 
if we cannot continuously enhance our software and web based service offerings in response to rapid changes in the market  our business will be harmed 
the software based services industry and computer industry are characterized by extensive research and development efforts which result in the frequent introduction of new products and services which render existing products and services obsolete 
our ability to compete successfully in the future will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a technically competent research and development staff and our ability to adapt to technological changes in the industry and enhance and improve our software and web based service offerings and successfully develop and market new offerings that meet the changing needs of our customers 
although we are dedicated to continued improvement of our offerings with a view towards satisfying market needs with the most advanced capabilities  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so on a regular basis and remain competitive with products offered by other manufacturers 
at the present time  we do not have a targeted level of expenditures for research and development 
we will evaluate all opportunities but believe the majority of our research and development will be devoted to enhancements of our existing software and web based services 
if our software and web based service offerings are not competitive  our business will suffer 
we are engaged in the highly competitive businesses of developing software based workflow and authentication offerings 
these markets are also continually evolving and  in some cases  subject to rapid technological change 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than we do 
these organizations may be better known than we are and have more customers than we do 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these organizations 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our markets include performance  ease of use  scalability  manageability  price and customer service and support 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully incorporate these factors into our software and web based services and compete against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure we face will not harm our business 
if we are unable to develop and market products to compete with the products of competitors  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
our business  including inscrybe healthcare  inscrybe office and our electronic signing solutions are relatively new business lines and although the level of competition for these offerings is unknown at this point in time  the field of software based solutions is highly competitive 
there can be no assurances  however  that any of our offerings will achieve market acceptance 
we also expect that competition will increase as a result of industry consolidations and the formation of new companies with new  innovative offerings 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their software and service offerings to address the needs of our prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced operating margins and loss of market share  any of which could harm our business 

table of contents our software and web based services are complex and are operated in a wide variety of computer configurations  which could result in errors or product failures 
our software and web based services are complex and may contain undetected errors  failures or bugs that may arise when they are first introduced or when new versions are released 
these offerings may be used in large scale computing environments with different operating systems  system management software and equipment and networking configurations  which may cause errors or failures in our software or services or may expose undetected errors  failures or bugs in such offerings 
our customers computer environments are often characterized by a wide variety of configurations that make pre release testing for programming or compatibility errors difficult and time consuming 
despite testing by us and by others  errors  failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial use 
errors  failures or bugs in our offerings could result in negative publicity  returns  loss of or delay in market acceptance of our software or services or claims by customers or others 
alleviating these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and resources and could cause interruptions  delays or cessation of our licenses which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and would adversely affect our financial conditions  results of operations and cash flows 
most of our license agreements with customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that these provisions may not prove effective in limiting our liability 
we have a significant amount of net operating loss carryforwards which we may not be able to utilize in certain circumstances 
at june   the date of our most recent year end  we had net operating loss carryforwards nols for federal income tax purposes of approximately  available to offset future taxable income 
under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  utilization of prior nols is limited after an ownership change  as defined in section  to an annual amount equal to the value of the corporation s outstanding stock immediately before the date of the ownership change multiplied by the federal long term exempt tax rate 
use of our nols could also be limited as a result of grants of stock options under stock option plans and other events 
in the event we achieve profitable operations  any significant limitation on the utilization of nols would have the effect of increasing our current tax liability 
risks related to our common stock our stock price is volatile and could decline 
the price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  volatile 
for example  our stock price during the fiscal year ended june  traded as low as per share and as high as per share 
we cannot assure you that your initial investment in our common stock will not fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including quarterly variations in our operating results  announcements we make regarding significant contracts  acquisitions  dispositions  strategic partnerships  or joint ventures  additions or departures of key personnel  the introduction of competitive offerings by existing or new competitors  uncertainty about and customer confidence in the current economic conditions and outlook  reduced demand for any given software or web based service offering  and sales of our common stock 

table of contents in addition  the stock market in general  and companies whose stock is listed on the nasdaq global market  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
since we have not paid dividends on our common stock  you may not receive income from this investment 
we have not paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception and do not contemplate or anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
earnings  if any  will be used to finance the development and expansion of our business 
the exercise of our outstanding options and warrants  or conversion of our outstanding shares of series b preferred stock  may depress our stock price 
as of june   the following options and warrants were outstanding stock options to purchase approximately  shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share  not all of which are immediately exercisable 
the weighted average exercise price of the outstanding stock options is per share 
these stock options are employee and non executive director options 
immediately exercisable warrants to purchase approximately  shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
the weighted average exercise price of the outstanding warrants is 
stock options to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share to an independent consultant which are exercisable upon achieving certain sales levels 
in addition  there are currently outstanding  shares of our series b preferred stock 
the holder of the series b preferred stock may convert these shares into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to per share 
accordingly  the outstanding  shares of series b preferred stock are presently convertible into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
to the extent that these securities are exercised or converted  dilution to our shareholders will occur 
moreover  the terms upon which we will be able to obtain additional equity capital may be adversely affected  since the holders of these securities can be expected to exercise or convert them at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable to us than the exercise and conversion terms provided by those securities 
further  in the event the conversion price of the series b preferred stock is lower than the actual trading price on the day of conversion  the holder could immediately sell all of its converted common shares  which would have a dilutive effect on the value of the outstanding common shares 
furthermore  the significant downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock as series b preferred stock holders converted these securities and sell the common shares received on conversion could encourage short sales by the holders of series b preferred stock or other shareholders 
this would place further downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock 
even the mere perception of eventual sales of common shares issued on the conversion of the series b preferred stock could lead to a decline in the trading price of our common stock

the company previously operated the epm service on behalf of the usps since march  under a strategic alliance agreement that expired on july  we intend to continue our efforts to market our software applications and web based services in the united states and european markets 
we also intend to focus on identifying additional applications and markets where our technology can address customer needs 

table of contents our revenues consist principally of transaction fees for web based services  software license fees  hosting fees and maintenance charges 
growth in our business is affected by a number of factors  including general economic and business conditions  and is characterized by long sales cycles 
the timing of customer contracts  implementations and ramp up to full utilization can have a significant impact on results and we believe our results over a longer period of time provide better visibility into our performance 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and the rules of the securities and exchange commission 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates  which include judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
a critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact our financial statements 
we believe that the policies described below represent our critical accounting policies  as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
however  you should also review our summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page f of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment  software development costs  patent costs  trademarks and licenses are reviewed for impairment using an undiscounted cash flow approach whenever events or changes in circumstances such as significant changes in the business climate  changes in product offerings  or other circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
software development costs software development and modification costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized based on anticipated revenue for the related product with an annual minimum equal to the straight line amortization over the remaining economic life of the related products generally three years 
amortization is included in depreciation and amortization expense 
goodwill goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events such as significant changes in the business climate  changes in product offerings  or other circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test at the end of each fiscal year using a discounted cash flow approach 
revenue recognition revenue is derived from transaction fees for web based services  software licenses  maintenance arrangements  hosting services  electronic postmark epm sales and post contract customer support services 

table of contents revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed and collectibility is reasonably assured 
multiple element arrangements are assessed to determine whether they can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
a multiple element arrangement is separated into more than one unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement  if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if these criteria are not met  then revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the period over which the last undelivered element is delivered  which is typically the life of the contract agreement 
if these criteria are met  we allocate total revenue among the elements based on the sales price of each element when sold separately which is referred to as vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe 
revenue from web based services  epm sales and post contract customer support services is recognized when the related service is provided and  when required  accepted by the customer 
software license revenue is recognized when the criteria discussed above is met 
maintenance and hosting services revenue is recognized over the period in which the service is performed 
revenue from multiple element arrangements that cannot be allocated to identifiable items is recognized ratably over the contract term which is generally one year 
management estimates preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
examples include estimates of loss contingencies and product life cycles  assumptions such as elements comprising a software arrangement  including the distinction between upgrades enhancements and new products  when technological feasibility is achieved for our products  the potential outcome of future tax consequences  and determining when investment or other impairments exist 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we make estimates on the future recoverability of capitalized goodwill which is highly dependent on the future success of marketing and sales  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when we believe it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized and we make assumptions in connection with the calculations of share based compensation expense 
actual results and outcomes may differ from management s estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
historically  our estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
if actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition 
stock based compensation we apply statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment fas r to account for employee and director stock option plans 
share based employee compensation expense is determined using the black scholes option pricing model which values options based on the stock price at the grant date  the exercise price of the option  the expected life of the option  the estimated volatility  expected dividend payments and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the options 
the company computed the estimated fair values of all share based compensation using the black scholes option pricing model and the assumptions set forth in the following table 
the company based its estimate of the life of these options on historical averages over the past five years 
the company retained a third party valuation firm to calculate expected volatility which was based on the company s historical stock volatility  historical stock 
table of contents volatility of comparable companies in the industry and implied volatilities based on the spot market for traded options in the company and comparable companies in the industry 
the assumptions used in the company s black scholes calculations for fiscal  and are as follows risk free interest rate dividend yield volatility factor weighted average option life months fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
because the company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of share based compensation for employee stock options 
management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of share based compensation as circumstances change and additional data becomes available over time  which may result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies 
such changes could materially impact the company s fair value determination 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments which subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and trade accounts receivable 
to reduce credit risk  we place our cash  cash equivalents and investments with several high credit quality financial institutions and typically invest in aa or better rated investments 
our credit customers are not concentrated in any specific industry or business 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information
