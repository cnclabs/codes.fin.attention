for more information regarding our critical accounting policies  please see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 

table of contents long lived assets investments in real estate properties are recorded at cost 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method 
the cost of the properties acquired is allocated among tangible land  buildings and equipment and recognized intangibles based upon estimated fair values in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
we estimate fair values of the components of assets acquired as of the acquisition date or engage a third party appraiser as necessary 
recognized intangibles  if any  include the value of acquired lease contracts and related customer relationships 
our method for determining fair value varies with the categorization of the asset acquired 
we estimate the fair value of buildings on an as if vacant basis  and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building 
we determine the allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over their estimated remaining useful lives 
we determine the value of land either based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset  internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio or third party appraisals 
the fair value of in place leases  if any  reflects i above and below market leases  if any  determined by discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the in place rentals  the resulting intangible asset of which is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal periods  if applicable  ii the estimated value of the cost to obtain tenants  including tenant allowances  tenant improvements and leasing commissions  which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease  and iii an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease up period  as if the acquired space was vacant  which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease 
we also estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with such tenant  such tenant s credit quality  expectations of lease renewals with such tenant  and the potential for significant  additional future leasing arrangements with such tenant 
we amortize such value  if any  over the expected term of the associated arrangements or leases  which would include the remaining lives of the related leases and any expected renewal periods 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate our long lived assets  primarily consisting of our investments in real estate  for impairment indicators in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations and adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future cash flows and sales proceeds is less than book value 
an impairment loss is recognized at the time we make any such determination 
future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
we did not record any impairment charges for the years ended december   and loans and other amounts receivable from third parties we evaluate the collectibility of loans and other amounts receivable from third parties based on a number of factors  including i corporate and facility level financial and operations reports  ii compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the borrowing or lease agreement  iii the financial stability of the applicable borrow or tenant and any guarantor and iv the payment history of the borrower or tenant 
our level of reserves  if any  for loans and other amounts receivable from third parties fluctuates depending upon all of the factors previously mentioned 
revenue recognition certain of our leases  excluding the kindred master leases  but including the majority of our leases with subsidiaries of brookdale senior living inc together with its subsidiaries  which include brookdale living 
table of contents communities  inc and alterra healthcare corporation  brookdale senior living  provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent 
base rental revenues under these leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease 
income on our straight line revenue is recognized when collectibility is reasonably assured 
in the event we determine that collectibility of straight line revenue is not reasonably assured  we establish an allowance for estimated losses 
recognizing rental income on a straight line basis results in recognized revenue exceeding cash amounts contractually due from our tenants during the first half of the term for leases that have straight line treatment 
certain of our other leases  including the kindred master leases  provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue parameters or other contingencies are met 
we recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only if the revenue parameters or other contingencies are met rather than on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease 
we recognize income from rent  lease termination fees and other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with securities and exchange commission the commission staff accounting bulletin i the agreement has been fully executed and delivered  ii services have been rendered  iii the amount is fixed or determinable  and iv the collectibility is reasonably assured 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb opinion no 

generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
 except that sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under sfas no 
r 
as required  we adopted the provisions of this accounting standard on january  we applied the modified prospective transition method of adoption in which compensation cost is recognized beginning on the date we adopted the accounting standard for all share based payments granted after the adoption date and for all awards granted to employees prior to the adoption date that remain unvested on the adoption date 
see note stock based compensation of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements regarding the effect the adoption of sfas no 
r had on our consolidated financial statements 
gain on sale of facilities we recognize sales of facilities only upon the closing of the transaction with the purchaser 
payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits and classified as other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
gains on facilities sold are recognized using the full accrual method upon closing when the collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured  we are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the profit  we have received adequate initial investment from the buyer  and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied 
gains may be deferred in whole or in part until the sales satisfy the requirements of gain recognition on sales of real estate under sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
fair value of derivative instruments the valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 
fair values for our derivatives are verified with a third party consultant 
such amounts and the recognition of such amounts in the financial statements are subject to significant estimates which may change in the future

funds from operations our funds from operations ffo for the five years ended december  are summarized in the following table for the year ended december  in thousands net income adjustments depreciation on real estate assets loss gain on real estate disposals other items discontinued operations gain on sale of real estate depreciation on real estate assets ffo historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
to overcome this problem  we consider ffo an appropriate measure of performance of an equity real estate investment trust reit and we use the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo 
nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property  plus real estate depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is ffo necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements and data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
asset liability management asset liability management is a key element of our overall risk management program 
the objective of asset liability management is to support the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels 
the asset liability management process focuses on a variety of risks  including market risk primarily interest rate risk and credit risk 
effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute 
table of contents levels and variability of ffo and net worth 
the following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
market risk we receive revenue primarily by leasing our assets under long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators  subject to certain limitations 
we also earn revenue from our mortgage loans 
our obligations under our revolving credit facility are floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related monthly interest payments vary with the movement in libor 
the general fixed nature of our assets and the variable nature of our obligations create interest rate risk 
if interest rates were to rise significantly  our lease and other revenue might not be sufficient to meet our debt obligations 
in order to mitigate this risk  in september  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in the original notional amount of million to hedge floating rate debt for the period between july  and june  the swap 
the swap is treated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes and is with a highly rated counterparty on which we pay a fixed rate of and receive libor from the counterparty 
in and  due to our lower expected future variable rate debt balances  we reduced the notional amount of the swap to million and then to million for the remaining term of the swap 
see note borrowing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
there are no collateral requirements under the swap 
as of december   the notional amount of the swap was million  which is scheduled to expire on june  to highlight the sensitivity of the swap and our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates  the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of basis points bps in interest rates as of december  in thousands swap fixed rate debt swap fixed rate debt notional amount  n a  n a gross book value n a  n a  fair value fair value reflecting change in interest rates bps bps the change in fair value of fixed rate debt was due to the issuance of approximately million of fixed rate senior notes and the assumption of approximately million of fixed rate debt as a result of our acquisitions during the year ended december   partially offset by a general increase in interest rates 
n a not applicable 
we paid million under the swap during the year ended december  assuming that interest rates do not change  we estimate that we will pay less than million on the swap during the year ending december  we had approximately million and million of variable rate debt outstanding as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in our outstanding variable rate debt from december  is primarily attributable to the assumption of million of mortgage debt in conjunction with the senior care transaction that was repaid on january   offset by a reduction in our outstanding balance on the unsecured revolving credit facility 
the swap currently effectively hedges million of our outstanding variable rate debt 
any amounts of variable rate debt in excess of million are subject to interest rate changes 
however  pursuant to the terms of certain leases with one of our tenants  if interest rates increase on certain debt that we have totaling million as of december   our tenant is required to pay us additional rent on a dollar for dollar basis in an amount equal to the increase in interest expense resulting from 
table of contents the increased interest rates 
therefore  the increase in interest expense related to this debt is equally offset by an increase in additional rent due to us from the tenant 
as of december   there was minimal cash flow impact from the fluctuation of interest rates on variable rate debt since we effectively hedged nearly all of our variable rate debt 
the fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current interest rates at which similar borrowings could be made by us 
we may engage in additional hedging strategies in the future  depending on management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies 
our market risk sensitive instruments are not entered into for trading purposes 
credit risk as a result of our spin off of kindred in may and the provident acquisition in june  we have a significant concentration of credit risk with kindred and brookdale senior living 
for the years ended december  and  kindred accounted for million  or of our total revenues  and million  or of our total revenues  respectively  and brookdale senior living accounted for million  or of our total revenues  and million  or of our total revenues  respectively 
accordingly  the financial condition of kindred and brookdale senior living and their ability to meet our rent obligations will largely determine our rental revenues and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
in addition  any failure by kindred or brookdale senior living to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities 
see risk factors risks arising from our business we are dependent on kindred and brookdale senior living  kindred s or brookdale senior living s inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could significantly harm us and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a reit included in part i  item a of this annual report on form k and note concentration of credit risk of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we monitor our credit risk under our lease agreements with our tenants by  among other things  i reviewing and analyzing information regarding the healthcare industry generally  publicly available information regarding tenants  and information provided by the tenants and borrowers under our lease and other agreements  and ii having periodic discussions with tenants  borrowers and their representatives 
liquidity and capital resources during  our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds from debt issuances  cash flow from operations  borrowings under our unsecured and previous secured revolving credit facilities  proceeds from stock option exercises  and proceeds from the distribution reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
we anticipate that cash flow from operations over the next months will be adequate to fund our business operations  dividends to stockholders and debt amortization 
capital requirements for acquisitions may require funding from borrowings  assumption of debt from the seller  issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities or equity offerings 
we intend to continue to fund future investments through cash flow from operations  borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility  disposition of assets in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties and issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  escrow deposits and restricted cash of million  and unused availability of million under our revolving credit facility 
we expect to fund the sunrise reit acquisition through a fully committed bridge facility  composed of a billion senior interim loan and a million senior perpetual preferred stock issuance  and or some combination of proceeds from asset sales in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties  borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility  mortgage loans assumptions and other sources 

table of contents revolving credit facilities in april  we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility the unsecured revolving credit facility 
the unsecured revolving credit facility replaced our previous million secured revolving credit facility 
the unsecured revolving credit facility matures in  with a one year extension option subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  and contains a million accordion feature that permits us to increase our total borrowing capacity to million 
in february  we gave notice of our intention to exercise the full amount of this accordion feature 
we anticipate completing this transaction by the end of the first quarter  although there can be no assurance that it will close or  if it does  when the closing will occur 
generally  borrowings outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating libor based rate per annum plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage  initially 
at december   the applicable percentage was 
our previous secured revolving credit facility also bore interest at a fluctuating libor based rate per annum plus an applicable percentage 
the applicable percentage for the previous secured revolving credit facility was from january  until its replacement in april convertible senior notes in december  we completed the offering of million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due the convertible notes 
the convertible notes are convertible at the option of the holder i prior to september   upon the occurrence of specified events and ii on or after september   at any time prior to the close of business on the second business day prior to the stated maturity  in each case into cash up to the principal amount of the convertible notes and cash or shares of our common stock  at our election  in respect of any conversion value in excess of the principal amount at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes which equates to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
the initial conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  including the payment of a quarterly dividend in excess of per share 
to the extent the market price of our common stock exceeds per share  adjusted downward in the case of quarterly dividends in excess of per share  our earnings per share will be diluted 
pursuant to the registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the convertible notes offering  we agreed to file a registration statement covering resales by the holders of shares of our common stock  if any  issued upon conversion of the convertible notes 
we will not receive any proceeds in connection with any such resales

we did not receive any additional proceeds in connection with the exchange offer 
dividends in order to continue to qualify as a reit  we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least of reit taxable income excluding net capital gain 
we declared dividends greater than of estimated taxable income for and intend to pay a dividend greater than of taxable income for we expect that reit taxable income will be less than cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non cash deductions in computing reit taxable income 
although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the distribution requirement  it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation 
if we do not have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the distribution requirement  or if we desire to retain cash  we may borrow funds  issue additional equity securities  pay taxable stock dividends  if possible  distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements

table of contents leased properties generally will be incurred by our tenants 
accordingly  we do not believe that we will incur any major expenditures in connection with these leased properties 
after the terms of the leases expire  or in the event that the tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under the leases  we anticipate that any expenditures relating to the maintenance of leased properties for which we may become responsible will be funded by cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings 
to the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required  our liquidity may be affected adversely 
our ability to borrow funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of the unsecured revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the convertible notes and the senior notes 
equity offerings in april  we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on form s with the commission relating to the sale  from time to time  of an indeterminate amount of debt securities and related guarantees  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants
