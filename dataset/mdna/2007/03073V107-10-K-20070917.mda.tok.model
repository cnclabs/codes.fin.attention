risk factors as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
the historical results set forth in this discussion and analysis are not necessarily indicative of trends with respect to any actual or projected future financial performance 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview since our inception in  we have been engaged in the research and development of technologies related to the formulation of polyurethane compounds and the manufacturing process for producing tires constructed of polyurethane 
we believe that we have developed unique polyurethane formulations that  when used in tire applications  substantially simplify the production process and allow for the creation of products with superior performance characteristics  including abrasion resistance and load bearing capabilities  than conventional rubber tires 
we also believe that the manufacturing processes we have developed to produce polyurethane tires are more efficient than traditional tire manufacturing processes  in part because our polyurethane compounds do not require the multiple processing steps  extreme heat  and high pressure that are necessary to cure rubber 
using our polyurethane technologies  we believe tires can be p roduced that last longer  are less susceptible to failure and offer improved fuel economy 
our aggregate revenues for the year ended june   june  and june  were million  million and million  respectively  and our aggregate cost of revenues during those same periods were million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended june   june  and june   we had net losses of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we expect to incur significant additional expenses as we expand our business due to increased selling  general and administrative expenditures related to the commercialization of our proprietary polyurethane elastothane or amerifill products 
we expect the increase in revenues from the expanded commercialization activities should reduce net loss in the near term and move us closer to profitability 
while the sale of polyurethane foam tires to original equipment manufacturers  distributors and retail stores accounts for most of our revenue at this time  elastothane and amerifill are significant to our potential future growth 
our business model provides for a diversified revenue stream 
we will continue to generate revenue through license agreements relating to the use of our patented manufacturing methods and systems  the sale of specialty equipment  the sale of proprietary chemical systems  the sale of a select number of finished tire products  and contract research and development services 
factors affecting results of operations historically  our operating expenses have exceeded our revenues resulting in net losses of approximately million  million and million in fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
in each of these periods  our operating expenses consisted primarily of the following cost of sales  which consists primarily of raw materials  components and production of our products  including applied labor costs and benefits expenses  maintenance  facilities and other operating costs associated with the production of our products  selling  general and administrative expenses  which consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related benefits paid to our employees and related selling and administrative costs including professional fees  research and development expenses  which consist primarily of equipment and materials used in the development of our technologies  consulting expenses  which consist primarily of amounts paid to third parties for outside services  depreciation and amortization expenses which result from the depreciation of our property and equipment  including amortization of our intangible assets  and amortization of deferred compensation that results from the expense related to certain stock options to our employees 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to uncollectible receivables  inventory valuation  deferred compensation and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical performance and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates allow us to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we believe the following accounting policies are our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that may be uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the sales amount is determined  shipment of goods to the customer has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 
generally  we ship all of our products fob origination 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill at june   we had capitalized patent and trademark costs totaling  the patents which have been granted are being amortized over a period of years 
patents which are pending or are being developed are not amortized until a patent has been issued 
amortization expense for the fiscal years ended june   and was   and  respectively 
we evaluate the recoverability of intangibles and review the amortization period on a continual basis utilizing the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we test our patents and trademarks for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we consider the following indicators  among others  when determining whether or not our patents are impaired any changes in the market relating to the patents that would decrease the life of the asset  any adverse change in the extent or manner in which the patents are being used  any significant adverse change in legal factors relating to the use of the patents  current period operating or cash flow loss combined with our history of operating or cash flow losses  future cash flow values based on the expectation of commercialization through licensing  and current expectations that  more likely than not  the patents will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost computed on a first in  first out basis or market 
the inventory consists of chemicals  finished goods produced in our plant and products purchased for resale 
stock based compensation equity securities issued for services rendered have been accounted for at the fair market value of the securities on the date of authorization 
on july   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on estimated fair values for all share based payments to employees and directors  including employee stock options and stock purchases related to our employee stock option and award plans 
sfas r supersedes our previous accounting under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb for periods beginning in the fiscal year ended june  in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to sfas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of july   the first day of our fiscal year ended june  our financial statements as of and for the period ended june  reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our financial statements for the prior year have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the fiscal year ending june  was  related to employee stock options granted during the year 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the fiscal year ending june  was  there was no stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options recognized during the fiscal year ended june  sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our statement of operations 
under sfas r  stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
at june   we had no unvested share based payment awards that required the recognition of compensation expense during the fiscal year ended june  stock based compensation expense recognized in our statement of operations for the fiscal years ended june  and is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas e  and only includes compensation expense for share based paymen t awards that were granted after july  and vested during the fiscal year ended june  and stock based compensation expense recognized in our statement of operations for the fiscal year ended june  and assumes all awards will vest 
therefore  no reduction has been made for estimated forfeitures 
the valuation of options and warrants granted to unrelated parties for services are measured as of the earlier of the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instrument is reached  or the date the counterparty s performance is complete 
pursuant to the requirements of emerging issues task force no 
 the options and warrants will be revalued in situations where they are granted prior to the completion of the performance 
seasonality a substantial majority of our sales are to customers within the united states 
we experience some seasonality in the sale of our closed cell polyurethane foam tires for bicycles and lawn and garden products because sales of these products generally decline during the winter months in the united states 
sales of our closed cell polyurethane form tire products generally peak during the spring and summer months  typically resulting in greater sales volumes during the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year 
results of operations our management reviews and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and assess the quality and potential variability of our revenues and cash flows 
these key performance indicators include sales revenue  net of returns and trade discounts  which is an indicator of our overall business growth and the success of our sales and marketing efforts  gross profit  which is an indicator of both competitive pricing pressures and the cost of sales of our products  growth in our customer base  which is an indicator of the success of our sales efforts  and distribution of revenue across our products offered 
the following summary table presents a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended june   and with respect to certain key financial measures 
the comparisons illustrated in the table are discussed in greater detail below

for the fiscal year ended june   our cost of sales related to our closed cell polyurethane foam products increased  or  compared to due to a substantial increase in product sales 
in  our gross margin increased to from the prior year due primarily to our successful efforts to obtain reduced raw materials pricing 
we obtained reduced raw material pricing during the second half of fiscal year ended june  and did not experience material increases in raw material pricing in fiscal we believe that our product sales margin can continue to improve as our increased sales efforts generate additional product orders to take further advantage of manufacturing efficiencies 
we believe we currently have sufficient foam product manufacturing equipment and employees to accomplish a substantial increase in production without incurring a proportionately equivalent inc rease in labor costs 
for the fiscal year ended june   we had  in cost of sales related to specialty pouring equipment supplied to one of our foreign licensees 
the cost was greater than the sale price for the equipment quoted by us to our customer  in part because the equipment was unique and had to be custom fabricated 
the cost of the equipment exceeded our original estimates due to modification and unexpected expenses incurred during the production of the equipment in the future we intend to make provision for modifications and unexpected expenses in determining our pricing for the sale of specialty equipment

although we believe that we will successfully implement our business plan  management cannot give any assurances that it will be able to do so or that we will ever operate profitably 
our business plan assumes  among other things  that our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue at a rate similar to the rate we experienced for the fiscal year ended june   that we will not experience a material decline in our product pricing  and that we will not experience a material increase in our customer bad debt 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes
