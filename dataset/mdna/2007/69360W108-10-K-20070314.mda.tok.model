item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
unexpected tax liability as a result of examinations and challenges by tax authorities may harm psb s financial condition and results of operations 
in the normal course of business  psb and its subsidiary are subject to examinations and challenges from federal and state tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments it has made and the businesses in which it is engaged 
recently  federal and state taxing authorities have become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions 
these tax positions may relate to tax compliance  sales and use  franchise  gross receipts  payroll  property  and income tax issues  including tax base  apportionment  and tax planning 
the challenges made by tax authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
see  item  note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
if such challenges are made and are not resolved in psb s favor  they could have an adverse effect on psb s financial condition and results of operations 
investors may not be able to liquidate their psb holdings when desired because there is no active public trading market for psb stock 
there is no active public established trading market for psb stock 
as a result  investors may not be able to resell shares at the price or time they desire 
psb cannot guarantee continued cash dividend payments or that it will be able to meet its obligations to holders of its trust preferred securities 
psb is a separate and distinct legal entity from peoples state bank 
it receives substantially all of its revenue from bank dividends 
these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on psb s common stock and interest on its junior subordinated debt 
the payment of dividends by the bank is subject to federal law restrictions as well as to the laws of wisconsin 
although semi annual cash dividends have been paid on psb common stock for many years  a decline in operating income or need to retain earnings for regulatory capital or growth may cause psb to lower or stop the existing cash dividend 
psb s articles of incorporation could make more difficult or discourage an acquisition of psb 
psb s articles of incorporation require the approval of two thirds of all shares outstanding in order to effect a merger  share exchange  or other reorganization 
this provision may discourage potential takeover attempts  discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price  or otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock

dividends psb expects that its practice of paying semi annual dividends on its common stock will continue  although the payment of future dividends will continue to depend upon earnings  capital requirements  financial condition  and other factors 
the principal source of funds for the payment of dividends by psb is dividend income from its bank subsidiary 
payment of dividends by peoples state bank is subject to various limitations under banking laws and regulations 
to fund the repurchase of of psb s common equity shares during the tender offer  the subsidiary bank made a dividend distribution to psb in excess of current year net income 
under state banking regulations  the subsidiary bank may not make dividend distributions in excess of year to date net income to psb during and without regulatory approval 
if regulatory approval is obtained during these future periods  at december   the bank could have paid a maximum of approximately million in additional dividends to psb 
however  to remain well capitalized under regulatory prompt corrective action provisions see note to the consolidated financial statements  dividends could not exceed approximately million as of december  psb has paid regular dividends since its inception in market prices and dividends price ranges of over the counter quotations and dividends declared per share on psb common stock for the periods indicated are prices prices quarter high low dividends high low dividends st nd rd th prices detailed for the common stock represent the bid prices reported on the otc bulletin board

management s discussion and analysis reviews significant factors with respect to psb s financial condition and results of operations at and for the three year period ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes  tables  and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
all figures are in thousands  except per share data and per employee data 
management s discussion and analysis  like other portions of this annual report on form k  includes forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance 
however  such performance involves risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those described in such forward looking statements 
a cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements is set forth under the caption forward looking statements in item of this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis should be considered in light of such cautionary statement and the risk factors disclosed in item a of this report 
executive overview this overview summarizes psb s business activities and presents the primary opportunities and challenges faced by management and the impact of economic and industry wide factors on psb s operating environment 
in addition  the near term and long term issues on which management is most focused are outlined in general terms as a backdrop for the detailed statistical and narrative analysis presented in this annual report on form k 
although psb operates as a community bank  its operating environment is significantly impacted by national economic trends and other industry factors 
these risk factors were outlined in item a previously 
psb operates in many ways as a local community bank  but larger in size and scope 
psb maintains a traditional retail and commercial banking business model and holds limited stand alone derivative instruments to hedge cash flow and fair value risks 
the primary sources of income are net interest income earned on residential and commercial loans made to local customers after payment of interest to depositors 
psb originates and sells long term fixed rate mortgage loans to the secondary market and services future payments on these loans for a substantial amount of fee income 
depositors pay various service fees including overdraft charges and commercial service fees which contribute to psb s noninterest income 
psb sells retail investment products on a commission basis primarily to individuals 
interest income on loans  mortgage banking income  service charges on deposit accounts  and investment sales commissions make up approximately of psb  s gross revenue  consistent with recent years 
psb serves customers through a network of eight full service locations with an emphasis on customer service and flexibility 
psb employees are substantial participants in community involvement for the betterment of psb s market areas  customers  and potential customers 
psb recognizes many opportunities for continued growth in products  customers  assets  and profits 
psb s relative size compared to typical community banks  thrifts  and credit unions allows it to offer a wide array of financial service products in a one stop shopping service model 
although greater in size than typical community banks  traditional community bank customer service and flexibility differentiate psb from larger financial service providers 
therefore  psb can offer better service to customers disenfranchised by large banks and large bank mergers while allowing them to continue their practice of one stop shopping and commercial support 
psb can compete against smaller local community banks and credit unions by continuing the same level of service these customers expect  but giving them an expanded and competitively priced product lineup due in part to economies of scale 
psb has invested in key management and branch personnel to capitalize on relationships in existing and adjacent markets 
psb s growth into adjacent markets minimizes costs for name recognition and awareness while increasing the speed in which customers are obtained via new locations and improving convenience of service for existing customers 
psb intends to grow at a level greater than may be able to be supported in existing adjacent markets 
therefore  future market expansions are likely to be out of the area  and be directed by an officer who is a local market leader in that area 
against this back drop of industry wide factors and competitive advantages and opportunities  management monitors several areas of risk  negative trends  and challenges 
the following items represent challenges monitored by management in both the short and long term 
these challenges and statistical analysis are presented in greater detail throughout this section of this annual report on form k 
net income declined 
per share during compared to a decline in net interest margin without asset growth  higher provisions for estimated loan losses  and increased employee health insurance benefits were the greatest factors behind lower net income  with these factors contributing 
of the decrease in earnings per share 
several special items were recognized in net income including a loss on sale of securities to restructure the balance sheet  gain on sale of vacant land formerly held for future branching  and an executive officer severance benefit 
the net impact of these special items was to decrease earnings per share by 
during the year 
during  psb determined an existing interest rate swap to convert a time deposit from fixed to floating rates did not qualify for hedge accounting 
elimination of hedge accounting generated a non cash charge against net income of 
per share 
the swap continues to be economically effective and any swap liability provision to expense represents a temporary timing difference to be recovered in future periods before swap maturity in october although the provision for loan losses increased compared to  the provision continued to be approximately of the average provision levels recorded during the three years ended continued historically low provisions for loan losses may not continue during due to planned growth in loans receivable or an increase in problem loan activity  thereby reducing net income 
nonperforming assets increased to 
of total assets as of december  compared to 
of assets at december  from an increase in nonaccrual loans 
psb believes the economies of the markets it serves may face headwinds in the coming year and has tightened credit standards which have also impacted loan growth 
the effects of a slowing local economy and situations with certain borrowers caused psb to downgrade credit quality ratings on approximately of its internally graded performing loan portfolio during the second half of despite these downgrades  substantial future net charge offs compared to past psb experience are not expected 
net interest margin continued a decline that began following rising short term interest rates that began with federal reserve discount rate increases during june have increased deposit costs faster than corresponding longer term interest rates 
static gap analysis shows earning assets repriced with similar timing to interest bearing liabilities  but the extent of deposit repricing has been greater than loans as the market s interest yield curve was inverted for much of in addition  heightened local competition for both loans and deposits has significantly lowered rate spreads 
improvements in net interest margin are dependent in part on psb s ability to limit core deposit funding rate increases while at the same time providing continued loan growth supported by these funds 
during  quarterly net margin on earning assets ranged between and  and totaled for all of compared to during all of as recent quarterly net margin has remained within a narrow range  net margin during is anticipated to approximate the level seen during intense local competition from new competitors entering psb s market and renewed competition for retail and small business customers from larger regional banks caused loans and deposits to decline as of december  compared to the prior year end 
loans receivable were impacted by the loss of approximately million of loan principal during from the loss of two significant credit relationships 
the decline in deposits was supported by additional fhlb advances and psb continues to rely significantly on wholesale funding including brokered deposits 
salaries and employee benefits increased in  led by a special charge related to executive severance benefits and substantially higher health benefit expenses 
excluding the severance charge and health benefit expenses  salaries and benefits increased just 
total salaries and benefits expense is expected to increase minimally during compared to levels before the severance charge 
psb presented a fully stipulated case to the united states tax court in december regarding an internal revenue service assessment for tax related to disallowance of interest expense on holding tax exempt obligations at its nevada investment subsidiary  psb investments  inc a decision from the tax court is expected during as described in item  note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  an unfavorable outcome in this tax court petition would have an impact on profits 
results of operations psb s net income decreased to  for compared to  in and  during  representing a decrease of in after an increase of in due to repurchase of approximately of psb shares during  diluted earnings per share declined less severely  down 
per share to in compared to in and in item of this annual report on form k presents other various financial performance ratios and measures for the five years ending december  a number of separate factors impacted psb earnings during the past several years as outlined in the table below 
despite these separately identifiable items  psb operating income before the provision for loan losses and special items continued to decline each year 
long term declines are a result of a consistently falling net interest rate margin  reduced mortgage banking income  and increased wage and occupancy expenses not offset by earning asset growth 
the following table presents psb s net income for the five years ending december  presented before the provision for loan losses after tax and identifying adjustments for special and nonrecurring income and expense items 
table summary operating income years ending december  net income before provision for loan losses  and special items  net of tax less provision for loan losses  net of tax net income before special items  net of tax net gain loss on sale of securities gain on sale of vacant land held for branching executive officer severance benefit sale of pulse atm stock recovery write off of collection expenses loss on abandonment of home office branch closure charges wisconsin state income tax settlement gain on curtailment of post retirement benefit plan net income net income in contained several special items 
prior to special items and the provision for loan losses  pro forma net income was  compared to  in and  in  declining in and in on a pro forma basis 
a loss after tax benefits on sale of securities was due to sale of lower yield securities with those proceeds reinvested in higher rates  lowering net income but improving security yields in future years 
psb sold vacant land purchased in for a planned branch expansion near stevens point  wisconsin for a gain of after tax expense after deciding a current de novo branch in that market did not fit psb s profit or expansion plans 
in december  an executive officer was given a severance agreement generating expense of after tax benefits after negotiating termination of an employment contract 
net income in benefited substantially from a reduction in the provision for loan losses to in from in however  net income before provision for loan losses and special items continued to decline primarily from a decrease in average net interest margin in and compared to prior years causing net interest income growth to be significantly less than operating expense growth cause by branch expansion and investments in premises and equipment 
net income compared to net income was reduced by one time charges for loss on abandonment of the previous home office and a grocery store branch location and settlement of a wisconsin state income tax issue related to the operations of the nevada investment subsidiary 
mortgage banking income declined by to in compared to  in as long term interest rates rose from historically low levels seen in and net interest income psb incurs market risk primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
the measurement of the market risk associated with financial instruments such as loans and deposits is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that reflect changes in market prices and rates can be found in item  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
psb s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital  while adjusting the asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
psb relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
in general  longer term earning assets are funded by shorter term funding sources allowing psb to earn net interest income on both the credit risk taken on assets and the yield curve of market interest rates 
however  a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact earnings  to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
psb does not engage in trading activities to enhance earnings or for hedging purposes 
net interest income represents the difference between interest earned on loans  securities  and other interest earning assets  and the interest expense associated with the deposits and borrowings that fund them 
interest rate fluctuations together with changes in volume and types of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities combine to affect total net interest income 
additionally  net interest income is impacted by the sensitivity of the balance sheet to change in interest rates  contractual maturities  and repricing frequencies 
the following tables present average balance sheet data and related average interest rates on a tax equivalent basis and the impact of changes in the earnings assets base for the three years ending december  table average balances and interest rates average yield average yield average yield balance interest rate balance interest rate balance interest rate assets interest earning assets loans taxable securities tax exempt securities fhlb stock other total non interest earning assets cash and due from banks premises and equipment  net cash surrender value life ins

as short term market rates continued to increase earlier in and existing long term loan and deposit products repriced  yield on earning assets increased 
but cost of intere st bearing liabilities increased  lowering the interest rate spread 
to in from in growth in sales of high yield money market and interest bearing demand now deposits to municipalities and individual high dollar balance accounts slowed during increasing  or to  at december  compared to  at december  deposit growth during and was fueled by sales of these types of accounts and accounted for virtually all local deposit growth during these years 
these high yield accounts do not include psb s customary retail high yield money market account and target a price relative to the day libor and change with movements of wholesale market rates as determined by management 
during  average earning assets grew to  compared to growth of during and during however  tax adjusted net interest income increased just 
to  compared to growth of to  during and growth of to  during as market rates increased during  yield on earning assets increased 
but cost of interest bearing liabilities increased  lowering the interest rate spread 
to from in although the volume of additional earning assets added  to net interest income during  approximately of this benefit was lost to declines in net interest margin 
changes in net margin were impacted primarily by the flattening shape of the yield curve  and local competitive pressures on loan and deposit pricing 
during continued discount rate increases by the federal reserve of basis points short term rate increases were not matched by corresponding yield increases of approximately basis points in longer term yields such as three year fixed rate maturities 
this reduced the spread between short term overnight funding expense and mid term rate income commonly in place for psb loan originations 
a flattening yield curve in would have been expected to reduce net interest margin even if the mid term assets funded with short term liabilities would have repriced in a manner consistent with overall market interest rates 
exacerbating the flattening of the interest yield curve was the extent to which market rate increases were able to be repriced by psb during of the basis point increase in short term market rates  psb short term average deposit funding rates increased basis points 
compared to the approximately basis point increase in market loan rates in the three year average term  psb loan yields increased basis points 
these disproportionate rate increases resulted from competitive pressures to limit loan increases and maximize deposit rate increases during yield on earning assets and cost of interest bearing liabilities declined during and however  during and  the decline in earning assets yield was greater than the offsetting decline in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
as short term interest rates increased beginning in june  earnings assets and funding sources tied to these short term rates rose compared to yields seen during in these included taxable securities  other overnight investments  and savings and demand deposits 
however  longer term earning assets and long term funding sources continued to mature at lower rates during  decreasing yields 
although the volume of additional earning assets added  to net interest income during  approximately of this benefit was lost to declines in net interest margin

excluding these special items  noninterest income increased  or 
vacant land in the portage county  wisconsin business park was purchased by psb in for a possible de novo branch location 
during  a decision was made to forego entering the market as a de novo branch  and the land was sold to an unrelated party for a gain on sale of  which is included in the gain on sale of premises and equipment 
in response to falling long term market rates in september and the ability to offset a securities loss against the one time gain on sale of land held for branching  psb sought to restructure its balance sheet for higher future earnings and to reduce interest rate sensitivity to falling rates by selling securities having an amortized cost of   fair value in low yielding investment securities for a loss and reinvesting in longer term higher yielding securities 
the security sales generated a pre tax loss of before a tax benefit of approximately million of the sales proceeds were reinvested in higher coupon securities with the remainder of the funds held in federal funds sold to repay wholesale funding maturities 
although classified as securities available for sale  psb typically holds securities to maturity and excluding the current sale had sold million in securities in the aggregate since januar y the current security sale does not represent a change in management of the securities portfolio and psb expects to continue to hold the majority of securities until final maturity 
psb entered into an interest rate swap receive fixed  pay variable payments to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in a brokered certificate of deposit during fair value hedge accounting allows a company to record the change in fair value of the hedged item  in this case  the brokered certificate  as an adjustment to income as an offset to the mark to market adjustment on the related interest rate swap 
however  during march  psb determined this swap did not qualify for hedge accounting 
eliminating the application of fair value hedge accounting in reversed the fair value adjustment that was made to the brokered certificate 
marking the swap liability to fair value generated a charge of during the swap continues to be economically effective and any swap liability provision to expense represents a temporary timing difference to be recovered in future periods before swap maturity in october the interest rate differen ce on the swap is settled monthly in cash 
net cash paid by psb on the monthly swap settlements was during and recorded as a reduction of other operating income 
had hedging treatment of the swap been allowed against the certificate of deposit  these cash payments would have decreased net interest income during see
