in the accompanying financial statements  the results of operations of properties sold during  and are shown in the section discontinued operations

no properties were classified as real estate held for sale as of december  therefore the revenues and expenses reported for the fiscal years ended december   and reflect results from properties currently held for investment by the company 
the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data in item and the consolidated financial statements of the company  including the notes thereto  included in item the company intends to continue to seek to acquire additional properties in core markets and further reduce its non core assets while focusing on an aggressive leasing program during critical accounting policies the major accounting policies followed by the company are listed in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the results of operations during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements certain leases provide for tenant occupancy during periods for which no rent is due or where minimum rent payments increase during the term of the lease 
the company records rental income for the full term of each lease on a straight line basis 
accordingly  a receivable  if deemed collectible  is recorded from tenants equal to the excess of the amount that would have been collected on a straight line basis over the amount collected 
table of contents and currently due deferred rent receivable 
when a property is acquired  the term of existing leases is considered to commence as of the acquisition date for purposes of this calculation 
many of the company s leases provide for common area maintenance cam escalations esc as the additional tenant revenue amounts due to the company in addition to base rent 
cam esc represents increases in certain property operating expenses as defined in each respective lease agreement over the actual operating expense of the property in the base year 
the base year is stated in the lease agreement  typically  the year in which the lease commenced 
generally  each tenant is responsible for his prorated share of increases in operating expenses 
tenants are billed an estimated cam esc charge based on the budgeted operating expenses for the year 
within days after the end of each fiscal year  a reconciliation and true up billing of cam esc charges is performed based on actual operating expenses 
rental properties are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  unless circumstances indicate that cost  net of accumulated depreciation  cannot be recovered  in which case the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value 
estimated fair value i is based upon the company s plans for the continued operation of each property and ii is computed using estimated sales price  as determined by prevailing market values for comparable properties and or the use of capitalization rates multiplied by annualized net operating income based upon the age  construction and use of the building 
the fulfillment of the company s plans related to each of its properties is dependent upon  among other things  the presence of economic conditions which will enable the company to continue to hold and operate the properties prior to their eventual sale 
due to uncertainties inherent in the valuation process and in the economy  the actual results of operating and disposing of the company s properties could be materially different than current expectations 
gains on property sales are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
gains are recognized in full when real estate is sold  provided i the gain is determinable  that is  the collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured or the amount that will not be collectible can be estimated  and ii the earnings process is virtually complete  that is  the company is not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the gain 
losses on property sales are recognized immediately
