item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data included in item and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
overview of performance and company and industry trends 
during  the company continued to execute its strategy of developing high quality real estate and harvesting the value of more mature projects through sale or contribution to joint ventures 
the company invested approximately million in development or predevelopment projects  land acquisitions or operating properties including eight new projects that upon completion are estimated to result in an aggregate investment of million 
the company or its joint ventures also sold six properties  several land tracts and contributed five properties to a joint venture that resulted in proceeds of approximately million 
these proceeds were used to fund current developments and acquisitions  to reduce indebtedness  thereby creating additional capacity to reinvest capital into new development projects  and to pay a special dividend to common stockholders in the amount of per share 
as a result of this activity  the company s consolidated aggregate indebtedness decreased from million at december  to million at december  and the consolidated debt to total market capitalization ratio decreased from at december  to at december  the company believes that these relatively low debt levels provide it with the ability to fund its development pipeline for the foreseeable future 
in  the company completed substantial construction and commenced operations of san jose marketcenter  the avenue webb gin phase i  the second phase of the avenue west cobb  and building a of king mill distribution park 
in addition  the company completed construction and closed the sale of all units in juniper  its first multi family project 
the company acquired land and commenced construction of projects in each of the company s operating divisions in the office multi family division began construction of its palisades west project in austin and acquired peachtree tower  a million square foot office building in downtown atlanta 
the retail division began construction of the avenue murfreesboro near nashville  with a joint venture partner and received final approvals to commence the first phase of the avenue forsyth  just north of atlanta 
the industrial division began jefferson mill distribution center  just north of atlanta and  with a joint venture partner  commenced construction of lakeside ranch  a project in dallas 
the land division began construction of blalock lakes  a community south of atlanta  and an additional phase of its callaway gardens project with a joint venture partner 
as these new products were being created  the company and its joint ventures sold three assets and contributed five assets into a joint venture to capture the value of these properties in what management believed to be favorable market conditions 
from its office portfolio  the company sold bank of america plaza and frost bank tower 
the retail division sold the avenue of the peninsula  a property in southern california that it acquired and converted into its avenue format in the company also formed a venture with an institutional investor and contributed five retail properties while the investor contributed cash to be used for future development by the company 
this transaction allowed the company to realize a value for these assets significantly in excess of their original cost 
consistent with past practices  the company returned a portion of the proceeds from its sales transactions to common stockholders in the form of a special dividend in the fourth quarter 
this dividend represents the third such dividend the company has paid since  the total of which is per share 
when combined with its regular quarterly dividends of per share over this same period  the company has paid an aggregate of per share in dividends to common stockholders since january of also in  the company experienced a decline in its residential lot business as a result of an overall softening of the housing markets in which the company does business 
the company s markets that were most affected were tampa and texas 
the tampa area has recently experienced an expansion of completed home inventories and a decline in new home closings 
while we expect housing demand to return to this market in the future because of job growth and migration of retirees to the area  the large inventories caused a slow down in builders purchasing the company s lots 
the texas markets were adversely affected 
management expects these 
table of contents adverse conditions to continue in while management is optimistic about the long term profitability of its lot business in general and in these markets in particular  it is unable to determine when market conditions will turn more favorable for the company 
the company s strategy is to annually invest million to million in development projects 
years such as provide more opportunities than others  however  the company s product diversity and the ability of management to understand and react to changing trends in the real estate markets should improve its ability to continue to develop through the changing real estate cycles 
with its expanded development pipeline  the company will need to perform at a high level in order to deliver the projects discussed above  and any future projects it undertakes  on schedule and at the returns expected at the beginning of the projects 
the company believes that it has developed appropriate systems and that it has experienced development and construction professionals managing these projects  which should help to mitigate the risks inherent in the development and leasing process 
as a real estate company  the company is dependent upon certain conditions outside of its control to create value for its stockholders through development 
these conditions include demand for its products as well as favorable interest rates and the availability of capital to fund its projects 
in addition  the general economic environment for its customers may affect the ability of the company to complete sales or leasing of its developments and may affect the amount of development that the company undertakes in future years and the ultimate results of its current development projects 
looking to and beyond  there are both positive and negative macro economic factors that will likely affect the company s business 
management believes that above average population and job growth in its core markets will have a positive impact on future development opportunities and on the profitability of these projects 
in the near term  management believes that additional supply of recently completed office  retail  multi family and industrial projects in its core markets will put pressure on rent growth and unit sales prices for multi family product 
in addition  the rise in land prices and construction costs  without a corresponding rise in rental rates  will make it more difficult to maximize returns on the company s projects 
the company  however  sees opportunity in mixed use developments as recent demographic trends show that individuals are seeking locations where they can live  work and seek entertainment 
management believes that the company  with its multiple divisions  is positioned to act on this demographic shift and expects to add additional mixed use projects to its development pipeline in the near term 
the company intends to be cautious in about new multi family projects because of a recent slowdown in sales activity in certain markets  but management is optimistic about opportunities in this product type over the next five years as a result of favorable demographics 
likewise management believes that the problems in the housing sector that have caused the company s lot sales to slow will turn and that there will continue to be opportunities for new residential lot developments over the long term for which the company is well positioned 
management also believes that in the event of rising capitalization rates  its strategy of creating value through development should allow it to compare favorably with other real estate companies who acquire completed properties for income and future market appreciation 
unlike these companies  management believes that if it is successful in identifying development opportunities that meet its underwriting criteria  it can continue to create value for stockholders in higher capitalization rate environments by capitalizing on the value it creates above cost during the process 
while this trend may make it less profitable to dispose of mature income producing assets  management believes that its conservative capital structure will provide it with other opportunities to raise capital needed for development 
two of the traditional financial metrics for evaluating a reit are funds from operations ffo and ffo growth 
as the company recycles capital from stabilized assets into development projects in order to create value and enhance stockholder returns over the long term  its ffo generally decreases in the short run 
this reduction in ffo results from either the distribution of capital to stockholders or the redeployment of capital into development assets that will ultimately result in value creation and higher yields  but are not yet producing income 
therefore  management believes that it is important not to place too much emphasis on the traditional ffo measures  but instead to look at the value the company creates through its development and leasing activities and the impact this value creation will have on the company s net asset value 

table of contents for the foreseeable future  the company expects to continue to pursue its business model by focusing much of its efforts on creating value through development 
management believes that this strategy has been successful in the past and should continue to maximize the total return to stockholders 
critical accounting policies 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item herein include a summary of the significant accounting policies for the company 
a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment or complex estimation processes 
the company is in the business of developing  owning and managing office  retail and industrial real estate properties  developing multi family residential units  and developing single family residential communities which are parceled into lots and sold to various home builders 
the company s critical accounting policies relate to its long lived assets  including cost capitalization  acquisition of operating property  depreciation and amortization  and impairment of long lived assets including investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  revenue recognition  including residential lot sales  land tract sales  multi family residential unit sales and valuation of receivables  and to accounting for investments in non wholly owned entities 
long lived assets cost capitalization 
the company is involved in all stages of real estate development 
the company expenses predevelopment expenses incurred on a potential project until it becomes probable more likely than not at the point the decision is made that the project will go forward 
after the company determines the project is probable  all subsequently incurred predevelopment costs  as well as interest  real estate taxes and certain internal personnel and associated costs directly related to the project under development  are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
capitalization of interest cost and sfas no 
accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate properties 
if the project s probability comes into question  a reserve may be placed on the assets 
if the decision is made to abandon development of a project that had been deemed probable  all previously capitalized costs are expensed or charged against the reserve  if one was established 
therefore  a change in the probability of a project could result in the expensing of significant costs incurred for predevelopment activity 
the company had approximately million of capitalized predevelopment assets as of december  at the time the company determines that a development project is probable  the company estimates the time and cost of construction to complete the project 
a change in the estimated time and cost of construction could adversely impact the return on the project and the amount of value created from the development of the project 
additionally  determination of when construction of a project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy requires judgment 
in accordance with sfas nos 
and  the company capitalizes direct and related indirect project costs associated with development projects during the construction period 
once a project is deemed substantially complete and held for occupancy  subsequent carrying costs  such as real estate taxes  interest  internal personnel and associated costs  are expensed as incurred 
the company considers projects and or project phases substantially complete and held for occupancy at the earlier of the date on which the phase reached occupancy of or one year from the issuance of a certificate of occupancy 
the company s judgment of the date the project is substantially complete has a direct impact on the company s operating expenses and net income for the period 
acquisition of operating property 
in addition to developing properties for investment purposes  the company also occasionally acquires completed and operating properties 
the company allocates the purchase price of operating properties acquired to land  building  tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based upon relative fair value at the date of acquisition in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for business combinations  which requires considerable judgment 
the company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including hypothetical expected lease up periods  known and anticipated trends  and local market and economic conditions  including probability of lease renewal and estimated lease terms 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired operating property  including land  building and tenant improvements  considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
intangible assets can consist of above 
table of contents or below market tenant and ground leases  customer relationships and the value of in place leases 
tangible and intangible assets are amortized over their respective expected lives 
if management uses incorrect assumptions  thereby incorrectly allocating acquisition cost to the different components or assigns an incorrect amortization period to any asset  then net income may not be reflected properly 
depreciation and amortization 
real estate assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method of depreciation 
management uses its judgment when estimating the life of the real estate assets and when allocating development project costs 
historical data  comparable properties and replacement costs are some of the factors considered in determining useful lives and cost allocations 
if management incorrectly estimates the useful lives of the company s real estate assets or if cost allocations are not appropriate  then depreciation and amortization may not be reflected properly in the company s results of operations 
impairment 
the company periodically evaluates its real estate assets to determine if there has been any impairment in the carrying values of its held for use assets and records impairment losses if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
the evaluation of real estate assets involves many subjective assumptions dependent upon future economic events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
for example  future cash flows from properties are estimated using expected market rental rates  anticipated leasing results and potential sales results 
a change in assumptions concerning future economic events could result in an adverse change in the value of a property and cause an impairment to be recorded 
the company has analyzed all real estate assets that had indicators of impairment and has determined that the carrying value of all real estate assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets does not exceed undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets 
based on this analysis  no impairment losses were required to be recorded 
unconsolidated joint ventures follow the same impairment assessment of their properties as the company 
additionally  the company evaluates its investments in joint ventures  if indicators warrant the need for a review  utilizing a discounted cash flow calculation 
if the calculation results in a lower amount than the carrying value of the investment  the company determines whether the impairment is other than temporary and records an adjustment  if needed 
the company also evaluates its goodwill annually  which requires certain estimates and judgments  specifically related to the fair value of its reporting segments 
based on the company s analysis  no impairment losses were required to be recorded 
revenue recognition residential lot and land tract sales 
in its determination of the gross profit recognized on its residential lot and land tract sales  the company utilizes several estimates 
gross profit percentages are calculated based on the estimated lot sales prices and the estimated costs of the development or on the estimated total land tract sales and any estimated development or improvement costs 
the company must estimate the prices of the lots or land tracts to be sold  the costs to complete the development of the residential community or the land improvements and the time period over which the lots or land tracts will ultimately be sold 
if the company s estimated lot or land tract sales  timing or costs of development  or the assumptions underlying all  were to be revised or be rendered inaccurate  it could affect the overall profit recognized on these sales 
multi family residential unit sales 
if a certain threshold of non refundable deposits are obtained upon sale of a multi family residential unit and other factors are met  the company recognizes profits of multi family residential units on the percentage of completion method 
therefore  sales on these units are recognized before the contract actually closes and before the entire sales price is obtained 
if the company determines there is a risk that the remaining sales price is uncollectible  an allowance for doubtful accounts may be created 
the company assesses the collectibility of the full sales price at closing by reviewing the overall market conditions in the specific area of each project as well as the market for re sales of individual units at each project 
these factors  combined with the amount of the non refundable deposits and an assessment of the buyer s financial condition  allow the company to assess the likelihood that the buyer will ultimately pay the contractual purchase price at closing 
additionally  cost of sales are recognized using the estimated profit percentage during construction of the project  which percentage could change significantly during the course of development 
the percentage of completion method involves significant estimates  particularly in determining the profit percentage to be realized on the overall project  the percentage that construction is complete at reporting periods during the project  and judgments as to the 
table of contents collectibility of unit purchase prices upon completion 
if the company inaccurately estimates costs to construct the project  the estimated profit percentage is ultimately incorrect or if its judgments regarding collectibility are incorrect  actual final results could differ from previously estimated results 
see discussion of new accounting pronouncements below for a new pronouncement affecting future sales recognition for multi family residential units 
valuation of receivables 
receivables  including straight line rent receivables  are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and may be uncollectible in the future 
the company reviews its receivables regularly for potential collection problems in computing the allowance recorded against its receivables 
this review process requires the company to make certain judgments regarding collectibility  notwithstanding the fact that ultimate collections are inherently difficult to predict 
a change in the judgments made could result in an adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts with a corresponding effect on net income 
accounting for non wholly owned entities the company holds ownership interests in a number of ventures with varying structures 
the company evaluates all of its partnership interests and other variable interests to determine if the entity is a variable interest entity vie  as defined in financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
r 
if the venture is a vie and in its judgment the company is determined to be the primary beneficiary  the company consolidates the assets  liabilities and results from operations of the vie 
for entities that are not determined to be vies  the company evaluates whether or not the company has control or significant influence over the joint venture to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation 
non vies under the company s control are consolidated and non vies in which the company can exert significant influence over  but does not control  are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the company recognizes minority interest on its consolidated balance sheets for non wholly owned entities which the company consolidates 
the minority partner s share of current operations is reflected in minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries on the consolidated statements of income 
contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures are recorded as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  and subsequently adjusted for income from unconsolidated joint ventures and cash contributions and distributions 
any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on the company s balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets on the joint venture s balance sheet is amortized as an adjustment to income from unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset 
if the company s judgment as to the existence of a vie  the primary beneficiary of the vie  and the extent of influence and control over a non vie is incorrect  the presentation of the balance sheet and results of operations could be incorrect 
discussion of new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for income tax uncertainties fin 
fin defines the threshold for recognizing tax return positions in the financial statements as those which are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties  accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties 
fin is effective january  for the company 
the company does not anticipate the effect of adopting the provisions of fin will be material to its financial position or results of operations

 applicability of the assessment of a buyer s continuing investment under fasb statement no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  for sales of condominiums  which provides guidance for determining the adequacy of a buyer s continuing investment and the appropriate profit recognition in the sale of individual units in a condominium project 
this issue requires that companies evaluate the adequacy of a buyer s continuing investment in recognizing condominium revenues on the percentage of completion method by applying paragraph of sfas no 
to the level and timing of deposits received on contracts for condominium sales 
this rule is 
table of contents effective for the company on january  and earlier adoption is permitted 
while the company has not analyzed in detail the effects of adoption of this standard on future results of operations or decided whether to elect early adoption of the standard  management believes that some of its existing condominium contracts would not meet the requirements for percentage of completion accounting and would  under the new standard  be accounted for on the completed contract method  which would result in later recognition of revenues than the company has historically presented 
the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  sab in september this statement requires that registrants analyze the effect of financial statement misstatements on both their balance sheet and their income statement and contains guidance on correcting errors under this approach 
the company adopted sab on december  and  in accordance with the initial application provisions of sab  adjusted retained earnings effective january  this adjustment was comprised of an overstatement of deferred tax liabilities  an overstatement of investment in unconsolidated joint ventures and an understatement of accounts payable and accrued liabilities for compensated absences 
all of these adjustments were considered immaterial individually and in the aggregate in prior years based on the company s historical method of determining materiality 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item for more information 
results of operations for the three years ended december  general 
historically  the company s financial results have been significantly affected by sale transactions and the fees generated by  and start up operations of  major real estate developments

the company does not believe that this softening market will affect this project  as of the units are under contract for sale and some of the contracts have been re sold in the secondary market for prices in excess of the original contract amount  but there can be no guarantee of the estimated outcome until the sales of the units close  which is expected to be complete by the first quarter of income from cl realty decreased million between and and increased million between and due to the changes in the number of lots sold  plus the mix of residential communities from which the lots were sold 
cl realty is a venture in which the company is a partner  and cl realty is in the business of 
table of contents residential lot development and land tract sales

table of contents stock based compensation 
the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  on january  utilizing the modified prospective method 
this standard requires that companies recognize compensation expense in the statement of income for the grant date fair value of share based awards that vest during the period 
the company calculates the grant date fair value of its awards using the black scholes model  which it also utilized under sfas no 
in its pro forma disclosures for periods prior to assumptions used under sfas no 
are not materially different from those used under sfas no 
r 
the adoption of sfas no 
r reduced net income by approximately million after accounting for the effect of capitalizing salaries and related benefits of certain development and leasing personnel to projects under development and after the effect of income taxes 
the total unrecognized compensation cost related to all non vested share based payment arrangements was million  which will be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
funds from operations 
the table below shows funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo and the related reconciliation to net income available to common stockholders for the company 
the company calculated ffo in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition  which is net income available to common stockholders computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding extraordinary items  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and gains or losses from sales of depreciable property  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis 
in  the company included million in income from a real estate venture related to the sale of real estate in its nareit defined calculation of ffo 
the company included this amount in ffo because  based on the nature of the investment  the company believes this income should not be considered gain on the sale of depreciable property 
the company presented the nareit defined calculation and also presented an adjusted nareit defined calculation of ffo to add back the losses on extinguishment of debt recognized in in connection with the venture formation on june  with prudential and the sale of bank of america plaza in september the company presented this additional measure of ffo because the losses on extinguishment of debt that the company recognized related to a sale or an exchange of real estate  and all other amounts related to a sale or an exchange of real estate are excluded from ffo 

table of contents ffo is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental measure of an equity reit s operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  has been fundamentally beneficial  improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
company management evaluates the operating performance of its reportable segments and of its divisions based on ffo 
additionally  the company uses ffo and ffo per share  along with other measures  to assess performance in connection with evaluating and granting incentive compensation to its officers and employees 
the reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to funds from operations  both nareit defined and as adjusted  is as follows for the years ended december   and in thousands years ended december  net income available to common stockholders depreciation and amortization consolidated properties discontinued properties share of unconsolidated joint ventures depreciation of furniture  fixtures and equipment and amortization of specifically identifiable intangible assets consolidated properties share of unconsolidated joint ventures gain on sale of investment properties  net of applicable income tax provision consolidated properties discontinued properties share of unconsolidated joint ventures gain on sale of undepreciated investment properties funds from operations available to common stockholders loss on extinguishment of debt funds from operations available to common stockholders  excluding loss on extinguishment of debt weighted average shares diluted weighted average shares liquidity and capital resources 
financial condition 
the company had a significant number of projects under development and in the pre development stage at december  and does not expect the number of projects or the amounts invested in development projects to decrease in the near term 
the company also has a large amount of undeveloped land  both consolidated and in unconsolidated joint ventures  which may progress into development projects in in order to position the company to fund these projects and potential projects  the company sold two office buildings  one retail property and contributed five retail projects to a venture with a third party that generated capital in as a result  total indebtedness decreased during to million as of december   representing of total market 
table of contents capitalization at december   and the company had million in cash on hand 
the company believes that it has sufficient availability on its credit and construction facilities and the capacity to generate additional capital to fund its development expenditures through the financial condition of the company is discussed in further detail below 
at december   the company was subject to the following contractual obligations and commitments in thousands less than after total year years years years contractual obligations company long term debt unsecured notes payable and construction loans mortgage notes payable interest commitments under notes payable operating leases ground leases operating leases offices total contractual obligations commitments letters of credit performance bonds estimated development commitments unfunded tenant improvements total commitments interest on variable rate obligations is based on rates effective as of december  as discussed above  the company formed a new venture with prudential in  and contributed its interests in five retail properties 
through december   prudential had contributed million in cash to this venture and may make further contributions of up to million to this venture in based on future leasing and development performed by the company on the contributed properties 
the cash contributed by prudential is expected to be used to fund development projects of the development venture  and the current funds are being used to reduce indebtedness of the company until the company commences development of such projects 
in addition to capital generated from this venture formation  the company received cash from the sales of bank of america plaza  frost bank tower  the avenue of the peninsula and from the sale of seven ground leased outparcels at its north point property 
these sales created taxable income that the company distributed to common stockholders in the form of a special dividend in the fourth quarter of of million see cash flows section below 
the company may consider selling other income producing assets in as a result of the continued strategic review and analysis of assets it holds 
with the relatively low leverage created by the capital generated from these transactions  the company expects to utilize indebtedness to fund a portion of its commitments in in the first quarter of  the company created additional borrowing capacity by expanding its existing revolving credit facility and by adding a construction facility 
the revised credit facility can be expanded to million under certain circumstances  although the availability of the additional capacity is not guaranteed 
the revised credit facility also reduced the spread over libor when compared to the previous facility  removed any restrictions on dividend payments provided the company s debt to total assets  as defined  is less than and provided additional flexibility in some of the financial covenants 
as of december   the company had million drawn on its million credit facility 
the amount available under this credit facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit  which were approximately million at december  the company s interest rate on its credit 
table of contents facility is variable based on libor plus a spread based on certain of the company s ratios and other factors 
as of december   the spread over libor was 
the company also entered into an unsecured million construction facility in the first quarter of while this facility is unsecured  advances under the facility are to be used to fund the construction costs of the terminus project 
as of december   the company had million drawn on its construction facility 
the company s mortgage debt is primarily non recourse fixed rate mortgage notes payable secured by various real estate assets 
in addition  many of the company s non recourse mortgages contain covenants which  if not satisfied  could result in acceleration of the maturity of the debt 
the company expects that it will either refinance the non recourse mortgages at maturity or repay the mortgages with proceeds from other financings 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on all of the company s debt was 
in  the company may enter into other unsecured or secured construction facilities to provide funding to specific development projects 
in addition  the company may enter into mortgage notes payable with stabilized properties and utilize the proceeds to fund its development commitments 
the company may also sell additional income and non income producing properties to generate capital or contribute additional assets to joint ventures 
the company may also generate capital through the issuance of securities that includes  but is not limited to  preferred stock under an existing shelf registration statement 
as of december   the company had approximately million available for issuance under this registration statement 
over the long term  the company will continue to actively manage its portfolio of income producing properties and strategically sell mature assets held for investment to capture value for stockholders and to recycle capital for future development activities 
the company will continue to utilize indebtedness to fund future commitments and expects to place long term permanent mortgages on selected assets as well as utilize construction facilities for other development assets 
the company may enter into additional joint venture arrangements to help fund future developments and may enter into additional structured transactions with third parties 
while the company does not foresee the need to issue common equity in the future  it will evaluate all capital sources and select the most appropriate options as capital is required 
the company s business model is highly dependent upon raising capital to meet development obligations 
if one or more sources of capital are not available when required  the company may be forced to raise capital on potentially unfavorable terms which could have an adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities increased approximately million between and approximately million of the increase related to the receipt of proceeds  to the extent of cumulative earnings  from csc related to the sale of bank of america plaza

the company s investment in unconsolidated joint ventures increased in due to increased contributions to the cl realty and temco residential joint ventures and distributions from joint ventures in excess of income decreased as a result of less asset sales activity in both of these factors contributed to the decrease in cash flows from investing activities 
partially offsetting the decrease was an increase in proceeds from notes receivable of approximately million  as the company collected an million note receivable in cash flows from financing activities

table of contents other matters 
the events of september  adversely affected the pricing and availability of property insurance 
in particular  premiums increased and terrorism insurance coverage became harder to obtain 
the availability of coverage has improved and  at this time  management believes that the company and its unconsolidated joint ventures are adequately insured on all of their assets 
while the company s cost of property insurance coverage has increased  management believes the costs are currently reasonable and should not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations in there can be no assurance that this situation will continue beyond off balance sheet arrangements 
the company has a number of off balance sheet joint ventures with varying structures 
at december   the company s joint ventures had aggregate outstanding indebtedness to third parties of approximately million of which the company s share was million 
these loans are generally mortgage loans or construction loans that are non recourse to the company 
one of the company s ventures  cf murfreesboro  has a million construction loan that matures on july   of which the venture has drawn approximately million

the company guarantees of the amount outstanding under the construction loan  which equals million at december  the retail center serves as collateral against the construction loan  and the company is liable for of any difference between the proceeds from the sale of the retail center and the amounts due under the loan in the event of default 
the company has not recorded a liability as of december   as it estimates no obligation is or will be required 
several of these ventures are involved in the active acquisition and development of real estate 
as capital is required to fund the acquisition and development of this real estate  the company must fund its share of the costs not funded by operations or outside financing 
based on the nature of the activities conducted in these ventures  management cannot estimate with any degree of accuracy amounts that the company may be required to fund in the short or long term 
however  management does not believe that additional funding of these ventures will have an adverse effect on its financial condition 
the company does not expect to make significant capital contributions to any of its remaining joint ventures
