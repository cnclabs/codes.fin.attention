item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of millipore corporation 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
business overview millipore is a global life science company that provides technologies  tools and services facilitating the discovery  development and production of new therapeutic drugs  vaccines and detection tools  together with other applications 
we serve the worldwide biotechnology  pharmaceutical and life science research industries by improving productivity and efficiency 
we primarily sell consumable products 
our products and services are based on a variety of enabling technologies  including filtration  chromatography  cell culture supplements  antibodies and cell lines 
in life science research  our bioscience division offers products and services for drug discovery  gene and protein research  research in the fields of molecular biology  cell biology and immunodetection  and general laboratory applications 
for the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  our bioprocess division offers products and services for process development  scale up  production and quality assurance of therapeutics 
our intimate knowledge of our customers research and manufacturing process needs ensures that our products and services are designed  recommended  used and supported to maximize the benefit to our customers 
on july   we completed the acquisition of serologicals corporation serologicals for approximately billion including the assumption of debt 
we expect the acquisition of serologicals to significantly strengthen the market position of our bioscience division by increasing its product portfolio into fast growing markets such as drug discovery products and services  nuclear function and stem cell research products 
the acquisition is also expected to facilitate our entrance into the upstream bioprocessing market by gaining a cell culture supplements offering for our bioprocess division 
we expect to increase sales of serologicals products in international markets such as europe  asia and japan  where we have a significant sales and marketing presence 
in connection with this acquisition  we issued percent convertible senior notes amounting to million  percent senior notes amounting to million approximately million  and amended our existing revolving credit facility 
on april   we acquired newport bio systems  inc newport for million including the assumption of debt 
newport was a provider of process containers  tubing manifolds  and assembly systems for collecting  storing  and transferring process fluids used in biopharmaceutical production 
the addition of newport s single use process containers  which include bags and liners  to our mobius disposable solutions provides us with the industry s broadest range of disposable products 
by manufacturing all of the components of an integrated disposable solution  we will eliminate the need for our customers to validate multiple products from multiple suppliers 
this acquisition reflects our strategic focus on increasing our presence in the disposable manufacturing market and builds on our acquisition of novaseptic ab novaseptic 
we compete in two related markets  life sciences research and biopharmaceutical manufacturing 
our bioscience division serves the life sciences research market  principally composed of companies and institutions conducting basic research  drug discovery and other analytical laboratory work 
our bioprocess division serves the biopharmaceutical manufacturing market  principally composed of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that develop  manufacture and sell products for the diagnosis  prevention and treatment of diseases 
in response to accelerating demand for healthcare improvement and disease prevention  new therapeutic products  vaccines  diagnostics and related products continues to grow 
new therapeutic products and vaccines  particularly biologics based on recombinant proteins  are being developed  approved and produced in growing numbers 

table of contents we leverage our brand  global infrastructure  proprietary technologies  highly qualified sales force  manufacturing operations and shared service centers to support our worldwide operations 
we sell thousands of products and we are continually developing and acquiring new proprietary products and technologies to advance our business 
with the addition of the serologicals product portfolio  we believe we now offer a more balanced product mix with strong growth and profitability characteristics 
because of the differing applications required by each of our target markets  we believe our approach to these markets benefits from more specialized and focused attention 
accordingly  we have aligned our business to better address each of these markets 
business drivers the market drivers of our bioscience division include global expansion of laboratories and the corresponding products used by scientists in these laboratories to conduct drug development and protein research 
we expect strong international growth in research markets to continue  particularly in asia 
continued pressures on global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to improve research and development productivity and to identify new drug candidates has led to increasing demand for our products that increase laboratory productivity 
products that are already developed  validated and optimized with each other save time and increase efficiency for the researcher  particularly when combined in kits 
our acquisition of serologicals added many new products  greatly extending the reach of our consumables  reagents and other products into the most popular laboratory protocols 
we believe customers are willing to pay a premium for innovation  expertise and streamlined purchase and service benefits 
the life science research market is also being driven by an increasing focus on virus research due to public health concerns and research precipitated by bioterrorism defense efforts 
the growth in clinical tests worldwide due to an aging population and improvements in clinical diagnostics technology is increasing the demand for consumable products used in these tests 
the market drivers of our bioprocess division include increasing demand and production volumes of marketed therapeutics and an accelerating number of approvals for new biologics 
in particular  a higher number of approvals for monoclonal antibodies  recombinant vaccines and other recombinant protein based therapeutics are driving the market 
monoclonal antibodies  which are separation intensive  complex to produce  and require significant use of our bioprocess solutions  are being approved at faster rates and are being produced in larger volumes due to increasing demand and their ability to treat intractable diseases 
the growth in biologics is creating an increase in demand for our consumable products that enable the production of therapeutic drugs 
we provide a number of technologies that can be used in small scale production of a drug and reliably scale up to commercial size manufacturing volumes 
our recent acquisition of the cell culture business of serologicals established our presence in our customers upstream process 
we are now strategically positioned to gain greater customer access  to increase our applications knowledge  and to identify new technologies and customer needs for downstream operations earlier  enabling us to optimize our customers productivity 
as a result  we expect our revenues related to a specific drug will increase over the various stages of the drug approval process  in particular  as the drug moves into later stage clinical trials and ultimately into commercial production 
the quarterly revenues in our bioprocess division can vary significantly  particularly due to fluctuations associated with our business related to biologics 
additionally  new initiatives by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to improve their manufacturing productivity have also increased the demand for our products and services 
in the united states  the food and drug administration s process analytical technologies initiative is affecting how our customers measure and characterize their production processes  which is creating demand for faster and more frequent testing utilizing our products 

table of contents strategy in june  we announced a new strategy designed to capitalize on our strong brand and market position and to support our plans for growth over the next five years 
as part of this new strategy  we are seeking to expand our products and services  build new technological capabilities and leverage acquisitions and collaborations 
in order to meet these objectives  we established the following strategic priorities continue to strengthen our leadership position with our biopharmaceutical manufacturing customers  become a strategic supplier to bioscience research markets  lead our industry in product quality and manufacturing effectiveness  and bring new talent into the organization 
during  we began to execute against this strategy  acquiring two companies  novaseptic and microsafe bv microsafe  and forming a collaboration with gen probe incorporated for next generation process monitoring tools 
during we acquired newport and serologicals 
we continue to execute a number of initiatives to improve further our profitability including significant reductions in the number of our worldwide manufacturing facilities  aggressive improvements to our procurement and manufacturing processes  market and customer segmentation  and enhancements of sales productivity 
highlights our consolidated revenues were derived from the bioprocess and bioscience divisions as follows year ended december  bioprocess bioscience total our strategy includes maintaining balance across our divisions in order to eliminate the negative impact of any one division or economy 
this balance is achieved through the revenue split above and the geographic dispersion of revenue from our divisions 
the composition of our geographic revenues is as follows year ended december  americas europe asia pacific total as part of our growth strategy  we invest in businesses in certain countries such as brazil  china  india  and in eastern europe that carry high levels of currency  political  and or economic risk 
at december   our investment in none of these countries exceeded percent of shareholders equity 
the strength of our divisions  value of our divisional and geographic balance  and execution of our strategy manifested itself in the operating results 
both of our divisions experienced solid organic growth in bioprocess bioscience consolidated reported growth less foreign currency translation acquisitions organic growth 
table of contents the strong life sciences research market generated better than expected business volume in our bioscience division 
this was primarily attributable to the strength of the laboratory water business  new products  expansion in international growth markets  and tactical marketing and sales enhancements in accordance with our strategy 
the bioprocess division also generated solid sales growth as a result of higher volume as compared to an exceptionally strong year in the primary driver of the sales growth was demand from our biopharmaceutical customers for our core filtration and chromatography products 
in addition to revenue growth  an improvement in consolidated operating profit also contributed to the strong growth in earnings per share 
operating profit increased as a result of lower costs realized in connection with our ongoing focus factory initiative  a business mix favoring the bioscience division s higher margin laboratory water products  selling  general and administrative expense control  and accretive business acquisitions 
these operating profit improvements were significantly offset by costs and expenses associated with the focus factory initiative  business acquisitions and integration  stock compensation associated with a new accounting standard  and the curtailment of our us pension plan 
in addition to organic revenue growth  our strategy also contemplates business acquisitions 
we invested billion and billion  including debt assumed  in the acquisition of businesses in and  respectively 
acquisitions in included serologicals  which amounted to  million  and newport  which amounted to million 
the acquisitions included novaseptic and microsafe  which amounted to million 
results of operations revenues net sales and percent sales growth by division  as compared with the prior years  is summarized in the table below net sales by division in millions year ended december  percent sales growth bioprocess bioscience total net sales and percent sales growth by geography  as compared with the prior years  is summarized in the table below net sales by geography in millions year ended december  percent sales growth americas europe asia pacific total the consolidated revenue increase of percent in to  million reflects organic growth of percent and revenues from acquisitions of percent 
the bioprocess division experienced percent organic growth and the bioscience divsion experienced percent organic growth 

table of contents bioprocess division bioprocess revenue of million for increased million  or percent  as compared to revenue growth was primarily attributable to business acquisitions and higher sales volume as a result of the strong demand for our differentiated products 
changes in foreign currency rates and product pricing had insignificant effects on the year over year comparisons 
revenue contributed by acquired businesses in represented approximately million  or percent  of the year over year revenue increase 
excluding business acquisitions  bioprocess division revenue increased million  or percent 
organic revenue growth was primarily attributable to strong demand for our core filtration and chromatography media products in the biotechnology market as a result of continued increase in biopharmaceutical production  particularly for monoclonal antibodies 
our customers are making investments to increase manufacturing capacity for biopharmaceutical drugs and expanding biotechnology product offerings through acquisitions and internal development 
we believe this is a positive long term trend for us and we expect to sustain revenue growth for our core products 
organic revenue growth was also positively affected by increased sales of our novaseptum products  which are used by biotechnology customers for disposable sampling 
we acquired this product line early in the third quarter of this increased revenue level is an example of the effectiveness of our sales force at integrating acquired products into our existing distribution network 
from a geographic perspective and excluding the effects of acquired businesses  revenues in the americas  europe and asia pacific increased million  million  and million  respectively 
the americas and european increases were primarily driven by sales of our core process filtration and chromatography media products 
the majority of the remaining sales increase occurred in international growth markets  particularly in china and india 
these increases were the result of our direct investment in sales and marketing and infrastructure for these markets 
weaker market conditions for our products in japan somewhat offset the asia pacific market revenue growth 
during  bioprocess sales increased percent as compared with excluding the effects of business acquisitions  the division s revenue growth rate was percent 
the division experienced strong demand for chromatography media and other consumable filtration devices by customers for use in the production of monoclonal antibody and recombinant protein therapeutics as well as for vaccines 
bioscience division bioscience revenue of million for increased million  or percent  as compared to changes in foreign currency rates and product pricing had insignificant effects on the year over year comparisons 
the serologicals acquisition in represented approximately million  or percent  of the year over year revenue increase 
excluding the serologicals acquisition  bioscience division revenue increased million  or percent 
organic revenue growth was primarily attributable to higher demand for our laboratory water and life science filtration products  higher sales in growing international markets  and the impact of new products launched late in this growth was driven by increased levels of life science research and development now occurring in both universities and pharmaceutical companies  particularly in north america 
the international market growth was also the result of higher sales of laboratory water products 
our customers are building and expanding their research laboratories in these markets and one of the first investments they make are in systems to produce purified water 
our successful implementation of initiatives designed to align sales and product management goals  to prioritize key customer relationships  and to launch targeted sales and marketing campaigns has positioned us well with these research customers  allowing us to serve them early in the drug development process 
from a geographic perspective and excluding the effects of serologicals  revenues in the americas  europe and asia pacific increased million  million  and million  respectively 
these increases were primarily driven by sales of our laboratory water and life science products  and in the case of china and india  our sales and marketing and infrastructure investments in these growth markets 

table of contents during  bioscience sales grew percent as compared with excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency translation rates  bioscience revenue increased million or percent 
strong demand for consumable products used in laboratory water purification  drug discovery and other general filtration applications was partially offset by declining sales of products used in oem devices and genomics applications by life science laboratories 
in addition  services provided to customers for water purification equipment grew as the installed base of equipment continued to grow 
gross profit margin in millions year ended december  gross profit percentage of sales gross profit increases in resulted from lower costs realized in connection with our ongoing focused factory initiative and a business mix favoring our high margin bioscience division laboratory water products 
however  the gross profit margin declined basis points as these increases were more than offset primarily by the amortization of the purchase accounting adjustments to record inventories acquired from serologicals at fair market value of million  or basis points  amortization of intangible assets acquired of million  or basis points  and acquisition integration costs of million  or basis points 
we expect to incur the remainder of the inventory amortization adjustment amount of approximately million in the first half of as we sell the acquired serologicals inventory 
costs associated with our focus factory initiative primarily employee separation costs  facility closure costs and accelerated depreciation also lowered our gross margins both this year and last year 
these costs amounted to million in compared with million in we will continue with our focus factory initiative in and plan to move manufacturing operations of two additional locations 
we expect the costs of this activity to be less than costs incurred in stock based compensation charges associated with the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r also had an unfavorable effect on the year over year comparisons 
sfas no 
r costs lowered gross profits by million in gross profit as a percentage of sales was percent in and percent in the decrease in our gross margin in as compared to was primarily attributable to million costs recorded in connection with our focus factory initiatives  which included million for severance  million for accelerated depreciation and million for inventory write downs 
in addition  our gross profit margin was negatively impacted by the sale of products acquired in connection with the novaseptic acquisition as the value of the acquired inventories were written up to fair value under the purchase accounting rules 
these were offset by improvements in production costs as a result of improved execution in our global supply chain as well as higher overall production volume in movements in currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on our gross margin in selling  general and administrative expenses in millions year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses percentage of sales selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million  or percent  in as compared to the primary drivers of the higher sg a expenses were the inclusion of serologicals expenses amounting to million  serologicals integration costs  significantly higher amortization of intangible assets  and sfas no 
r costs 
serologicals integration costs were million in and were 
table of contents primarily attributable to professional advisor fees  employee separations  and incremental travel 
amortization expense related to acquisitions increased million in as compared to we anticipate amortization of intangible assets to be approximately million in sg a also increased million in for estimated costs related to an existing environmental liability and million attributable to the curtailment of our retirement plan  neither of which we expect to recur 
employee stock based compensation expenses contributed million to the year over year increase  as a result of adopting sfas no 
r 
additional drivers for higher sg a expenses were increased investments in international growth markets and increased headcount in both bioprocess and bioscience divisions to support our sales and marketing initiatives in sg a expenses increased million or percent in as compared to included in our sg a expenses were million executive transition costs and million severance related to our divisional consolidation as compared to million in ceo transition costs recorded in the executive transition costs included costs associated with the ceo transition and other executive termination agreements 
higher sg a expenses in also included million higher incentive compensation and salaries as a result of improved operating results and increases in our overall employee headcount 
in addition  we incurred higher professional fees in as a result of various corporate initiatives  including repatriation of foreign earnings  development of corporate strategy  recruiting costs  sales training  and demolition costs for our bedford campus 
operating expenses from our novaseptic and microsafe acquisitions also accounted for million of the increase in our sg a expenses 
the demolition costs for our bedford campus were for site preparation for our new research and development facility which was completed in research and development expenses in millions year ended december  research and development percentage of sales research and development r d expenses increased million  or percent  in as compared to higher r d expenses in were primarily attributable to the inclusion of serologicals expenses amounting to million and related integration costs of million 
employee stock based compensation expense accounted for million of the year over year increase  which was the result of adopting sfas no 
r as of january  r d expenses increased million  or percent  in compared to included in r d expenses were a million increase in incentive compensation and salaries  million expenses from our new acquisitions  and million severance related to the consolidation of our laboratory water and life science operating segments 
purchased in process research and development in  we wrote off million of purchased in process r d costs in connection with our novaseptic acquisition 
this represented the fair value of two r d projects that were still in development stage prior to reaching technological feasibility and were deemed to have no alternative future use 
these projects  which were approximately percent complete at the date of acquisition  were expected to be completed in with an estimated additional spending of approximately million  primarily related to labor costs 
the estimated fair value of these projects was determined based on the use of a discounted cash flow model 
for each project  the estimated after tax cash flows were discounted to the present value using a discount rate of percent 

table of contents interest income expense interest income increased million in as compared to we earned interest income this year as a result of investing the proceeds of borrowings under our revolver in december and under our percent convertible senior notes and the percent senior notes issued in june in connection with the acquisition of serologicals 
in millions year ended december  interest expense average interest rate during the year interest expense increased million in as compared the increases were primarily attributable to a full year of borrowings under our revolving credit facility as well as borrowings under the percent convertible senior notes and the percent senior notes issued in june in connection with the serologicals acquisition 
the serologicals acquisition in july was financed with the borrowings under these debt instruments 
initial revolver borrowings occurred in december in connection with the repatriation of earnings under the american jobs creation act 
commitment fees of million associated with a bridge loan commitment we secured in connection with the serologicals acquisition also contributed to the interest expense increase in versus the prior year 
interest expense decreased million in as compared with which was the result of a decreased amount of average debt outstanding as well as increased cash balances due to strong operating cash flows 
during the first half of  we repaid million of borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility 
in december  we borrowed million under a new revolving credit facility in connection with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act 
the incremental interest expense from this borrowing was negligible because we borrowed the funds at the end of and invested the cash received in various short term commercial paper and other marketable securities 
provision for income taxes year ended december  effective income tax rate the effective income tax rates for  and reflected the tax benefit associated with lower tax rates on international earnings  which we intend to indefinitely reinvest outside of the united states 
the significant decrease in the effective tax rate as compared to was attributable to our repatriation of foreign earnings in accordance with the american jobs creation act of the income tax provision was lower  and the effective increase tax rate was percentage points lower  than as a result of the repatriation 
the effective tax rate was also lowered by significant serologicals integration costs incurred in the united states in the second half of the year and costs surrounding the transfer of production activities from puerto rico  both of which caused a shift of pre tax income to lower tax rate jurisdictions as compared to in  we are projecting a higher tax rate due to forecasted levels of taxable income in higher tax rate jurisdictions as compared to our profit mix 
in the normal course of business  we are examined by various tax authorities  including the internal revenue service irs 
in  the irs completed the examination phase of and and commenced examination of and although the outcome of these examinations cannot be determined  we believe adequate reserve has been provided for any potential unfavorable financial statement impact 
any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease net income  respectively  in the period such determination is made 

table of contents the higher tax rate in as compared to was primarily a result of of the tax obligations related to the repatriation of foreign earnings noted above  partially offset by the release of million of tax valuation allowance 
the remainder of the increase in our effective tax rate was the result of geographic distribution of our profits 
capital resources and liquidity the following table shows information about our capitalization as of the dates indicated total capitalization in millions  except ratio amounts december  december  cash and cash equivalents total debt net debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents total capitalization debt plus equity net capitalization debt plus equity less cash and cash equivalents debt to total capitalization net debt to total capitalization we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing  and financing activities 
our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to fund operating activities  capital expenditures  investments in businesses  product development  employee benefit plans  and debt service 
our primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
the sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by  among other factors  a decrease in demand for our products  our ability to integrate acquisitions  deterioration in certain financial ratios  and market changes in general 
in june  we issued billion of long term debt  the proceeds of which  together with borrowings under our revolver  were used to support the funding of the serologicals acquisition 
our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk based interest rates is partly a function of our existing debt to capitalization levels as well as our current credit standing 
the issuance of billion in long term debt in increased our level of debt to total capitalization to percent from percent 
our credit ratings are reviewed regularly by major debt rating agencies such as standard poor s and moody s investors service 
our senior unsecured notes are rated bbb by standard poor s and ba by moody s investors service and our revolving credit facility is rated bbb and baa by standard and poor s and moody s investors service  respectively 
our senior convertible notes are rated bb by standard poor s and have not been rated by moody s investors service 
we believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs 
furthermore  our ability to obtain equity financing as well as availability under our revolver  provides additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required 

table of contents cash flows the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash over the periods indicated in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash provided by used for financing activities decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents were million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million was primarily driven by cash used in acquisitions of  million partially offset by the net proceeds of debt borrowings of million and cash provided by operating activities of million 
operating cash flows cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  and was primarily attributable to our net income of million and non cash adjustments for depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation expense of million  and curtailment loss on our pension plan of million 
these factors were partially offset by changes in our deferred income tax positions of million and changes in our net working capital of million 
the million cash flow decrease caused by changes in our working capital was primarily attributable to increases in accounts receivable of million driven by the higher sales volume  increases in inventories of million driven by our factory consolidation initiatives  decreases in accrued expenses of million caused by lower accrued variable compensation and accrued severance expenses as a result of payments under restructuring initiatives  and decreases in income taxes payable of million driven by higher united states tax payments this year related to the repatriation of foreign earnings in accordance with the american jobs creation act of  higher taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions as a result of higher taxable profits  and the prior year utilization of net operating loss carryforwards that did not recur during the higher working capital levels were partially offset by higher increased accounts payable balances of million driven principally by the increased spending on inventories discussed above 
the incremental inventory discussed above and the inclusion of the inventory included in our purchase of serologicals caused days supply in inventory to increase days to days at december  compared with days at december  we anticipate that we will generate cash inflows in as we sell this inventory 
days sales outstanding in ending accounts receivable remained the same at days at december  as compared with december   showing our continued focus on cash collections 
investing cash flows cash used in investing activities was billion during compared with million during the increase was primarily attributable to our acquisition of serologicals 
the total purchase price for serologicals  net of cash acquired  was billion  including the assumption of debt 
we paid serologicals convertible debt amounting to million in august upon conversion by the debt holders  which was recorded as cash used in financing activities 
as of december   we no longer held marketable securities  which resulted in a net cash inflow of million during the year ended december  we also invested million in capital projects and fixed assets  of which million was attributable to the construction of our new research and development center in bedford  massachusetts that was completed in october we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million 
in addition  we invested million for the acquisition of newport in april 
table of contents financing cash flows cash provided by financing activities was million during compared with million during the increase was primarily attributable to the debt raised for our july  acquisition of serologicals 
cash proceeds amounted to million for the percent convertible senior notes and million approximately million for the percent senior notes 
these proceeds were partially offset by debt discount of million and payments of debt issuance and amendment costs associated with the debt offerings amounting to million 
repayments of debt in included revolver borrowings of million and acquired serologicals convertible debentures of million 
cash provided by financing activities was also higher as a result of cash receipts amounting to million from employees upon the exercise of stock options 
financing commitments short term debt short term debt consisted of our percent ten year unsecured notes in the aggregate amount of million  which are due in april as of december   the notes had a fair market value of million 
we intend to repay these notes upon maturity with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
revolving credit facility we entered into an agreement for a five year unsecured revolving credit facility the revolver in december the acquisition of serologicals on july  and the related financing required us to change certain terms of the revolver agreement 
accordingly  we amended the agreement in june some of which became effective on july  to permit the consummation of the serologicals acquisition and issuance and incurrence of certain additional indebtedness in connection with the acquisition  extend the maturity date to june   require interest rate and commitment fee adjustments based on specified credit ratings  require the pledge of substantially all our assets to secure our obligations under the revolver if specified credit rating levels are reached  and adjust certain restrictions and financial covenants 
we further amended the revolver agreement in july to increase the borrowing availability under the domestic facility from million  or million  to million  or million 
in the second quarter of  we recorded million of deferred financing costs associated with amending the revolver agreement 
we are required to pay a commitment fee ranging between percent and percent annually  based on the debt rating  on unused commitments 
we are required to maintain certain leverage and interest coverage ratios as set forth in the revolver agreement 
the agreement also includes limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to merge  consolidate  or sell assets  to create liens  to make payments in respect of capital stock or subordinated debt  as well as other customary covenants and representations 
in general  the leverage ratio is calculated by dividing our total outstanding indebtedness at december  by our cumulative adjusted cash earnings for the twelve months ended at december  the interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our cumulative adjusted cash earnings for the twelve months ended at december  by our cumulative gross interest expense for the twelve months ended at december  
table of contents the following table summarizes the financial covenant requirements and our compliance with these covenants as of december  covenant requirement actual at december  maximum leverage ratio minimum interest coverage ratio the following table summarizes our future financial covenant requirements fiscal quarter ending maximum leverage ratio minimum interest coverage ratio march  june  september  december  and thereafter our ability to continue to comply with these covenants will depend primarily on the success in growing our business and generating substantial operating cash flow 
future compliance with the covenants may be adversely affected by various economic  financial  and industry factors 
noncompliance with the covenants would constitute an event of default under the revolver  allowing the lenders to accelerate repayment of any outstanding borrowings 
in the event of any potential failure by us to continue to be in compliance with any covenants  we would seek to negotiate amendments to the applicable covenants or to obtain compliance waivers from our lenders 
as of december   we had borrowings of million  or million outstanding under the revolver  which were classified as long term debt because of our intent and ability to continuously refinance them 
as of december   we had million  or million  available for borrowing on the revolver 
convertible senior notes due in june  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes the convertible notes in a private placement offering 
the convertible notes bear interest at percent per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year  beginning on december  commencing with the six month period beginning on december   if the average trading price of the convertible notes for the five consecutive trading days preceding such six month periods equals percent or more of the principal amount  contingent interest will accrue at the rate of percent of the average trading price of the convertible notes 
the convertible notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness 
the convertible notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness and all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries  including trade payables 
the convertible notes will mature on june  we used the net proceeds from this offering to complete the acquisition of serologicals on july  we recorded million of deferred financing costs associated with this offering 
holders of the convertible notes may convert their notes into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock prior to june  under certain conditions 
the convertible notes may be converted if the closing sale price of our common stock for each of the or more trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds percent of the conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter 
the convertible notes may also be converted during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period in which the average trading price per  principal amount of the convertible notes was equal to or less than percent of the average conversion value of the notes during this period 
the convertible 
table of contents notes will also be convertible if we make certain distributions on our common stock or engage in certain transactions  if we call the convertible notes for redemption  and at any time from november  through december  and any time on or after june  upon conversion  the convertible notes will be converted into cash for the principal amount and shares of our common stock for the conversion premium  if any  based on an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustments

holders may also require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon a fundamental change at a repurchase price in cash equal to percent of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased  plus accrued but unpaid interest 
a holder that surrenders the convertible notes for conversion in connection with a make whole fundamental change that occurs before december  may in certain circumstances be entitled to an increased conversion rate 
however  in lieu of increasing the conversion rate applicable to those convertible notes  we may in certain circumstances elect to adjust the conversion rate and our related conversion obligation so that the convertible notes will be convertible into shares of the acquiring company s common stock  except that the principal return due upon conversion will continue to be payable in cash 
the convertible notes were issued to qualified institutional buyers as defined in rule a under the securities act in a private placement transaction 
we were required to file and maintain an effective shelf registration statement under the securities act within days after issuance of the convertible notes for the resale of the convertible notes and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes 
in the event that we failed to file and maintain an effective registration statement  we would have been required to pay additional interest equal to percent per annum of the aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes for the day period beginning on the date of the registration default and thereafter at a rate per year equal to percent 
we fulfilled our initial obligation by filing the required registration statement on form s on august  although we are not required to maintain any specified financial ratios under the convertible notes agreement  we will be considered in default if we fail to fulfill our conversion or redemption obligations  make required interest payments  provide notice to holders of the convertible notes in certain specified circumstances  or cure our default on any indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries in the aggregate principal amount of million or more 
if an event of default has occurred and is continuing  the principal amount of the convertible notes plus interest thereon may become immediately due and payable

in addition  we may redeem  at our option  in whole but not in part  at a redemption price equal to percent of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  upon the occurrence of certain tax events in the united states 
the indenture for the euro notes places certain restrictions on our ability to create  incur  assume or suffer liens on our manufacturing plants and other principal facilities in the united states and ability to enter into certain sale lease back transactions 
we would also be considered in default if we fail to fulfill our redemption obligations  make required interest payments  provide notice to holders of the euro notes in certain specified circumstances  or cure our default on any indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries in the aggregate principal amount of million or more 
if an event of default has occurred and is continuing  the principal amounts of the euro notes plus any accrued interest thereon may become immediately due and payable 
we are currently in compliance with the covenant restrictions 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments while our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments did not change materially between december  and december   our minimum future payments on our long term debt obligations increased from million at december  to  million at december  the following table summarizes our minimum future payments under our contractual obligations at december  payment due total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt obligations non cancellable operating leases employee pension and postretirement medical plans non cancellable purchase obligations total we maintain various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans for the benefit of our employees 
at december   our us pension plan and postretirement benefit plans were under funded by million and million  respectively 
we anticipate funding for these plans will be approximately million in at december   our foreign retirement plans were under funded by million 
our future pension expense and pension liabilities will be affected by fluctuations in future discount rates as well as the fair market value of assets used to fund these plans 
our purchase obligations include obligations related to the future purchase of goods and services  capital lease obligations  and other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet 
amounts included in the table above for employee pension and postretirement medical plans reflect projected benefit payments as determined by our actuarial service provider 
outstanding borrowings of million under our revolver are included in the table above as payments due in years because we intend to refinance the revolver on a long term basis 

table of contents critical accounting estimates preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results in these areas could differ from management s estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized when we meet all of the criteria specified in securities exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
these criteria include evidence of an arrangement is in place  related prices are fixed or determinable  delivery or performance has occurred  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
signed customer purchase orders or sales agreements evidence our sales arrangements 
these purchase orders and sales agreements specify both selling prices and quantities  which are the basis for recording sales revenue 
trade terms for the majority of our sales contracts indicate that title and risk of loss pass from us to our customer when we ship products from our facilities  which is when revenue is recognized 
revenue is deferred until our products arrive at customers facilities in situations where trade terms indicate that title and risk of loss pass from us to the customers upon their receipt of our products 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and ship products only to customers that satisfy our credit evaluation 
we also maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make required payments 
standard consumable and hardware products account for over percent of our total consolidated revenues and are typically sold with standard terms and conditions 
revenues for these products are recognized when the criteria of sab have been satisfied 
these occur either upon shipment or delivery to the customers 
in instances where we sell filtration systems products with a related installation obligation  we generally recognize revenue related to the filtration systems when title passes and recognize revenue related to the installation when installation is complete 
the allocation of revenue between the filtration system and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale 
in limited cases  our customers may require site acceptance testing for certain customized products built to customers specifications 
revenues on these products are deferred upon shipment and are recognized when site acceptance testing are completed 
revenue from service arrangements is recognized when the services are provided 
for laboratory water systems  installation and maintenance service revenues are recognized when the site service visit is completed 
for validation and sample testing services provided to customers  revenue is recognized when the contracted study is completed and accepted by the customer 
revenue for fixed price contracts associated with our large  custom process equipment business is recognized under the percentage of completion method poc 
over the past three years  approximately percent of our revenues have been derived from poc sales and in approximately percent 
revenue is recognized based on the ratio of hours expended compared with the total estimated hours to complete the construction of the process equipment 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimates of the percent completed is reflected in the period in which the changes become known 
in the event that assumptions used in 
table of contents calculating poc during the construction of the process equipment are later revised  total revenue and expenses estimated for contracts upon completion could differ from the latter estimate 
if it is estimated that the project will result in a loss when completed  the entire loss is recognized at that point 
actual results related to poc estimates have been materially the same as the assumptions used at the beginning of each contract 
in addition  should a poc contract be cancelled while in progress  we would generally be able to recover expenses incurred with progress payments previously received during the design and construction period 
typically  such progress payments can range between percent and percent of the total contract sales value 
historically  we have experienced few cancellations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we regularly evaluate our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable 
allowances for doubtful accounts are provided when collection becomes unlikely 
in performing this evaluation  significant estimates are involved  including an analysis of risks on a customer by customer basis 
based upon this information  we record an allowance for the outstanding receivable amount believed to be uncollectible 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately percent of gross receivables 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation 
our product life cycle is generally a minimum of years and may be in excess of years 
therefore  given the stable demand for our products  we generally rely upon recent historic usage  expiration dates  and estimated future demand in estimating the realizable value of our inventory 
finished goods and components that are determined to be obsolete are written off when such determination is made 
in certain cases  such as for newly introduced products and overstocked products  estimated future demand is considered in establishing inventory write downs 
raw material and work in process inventories are also reviewed for obsolescence and alternative or future use based on reviewing manufacturing plans  estimated future demand and market conditions 
in situations where it is determined that work in process inventories cannot be converted into finished goods  the inventories are written down to net realizable value 
inventory at december  and reflects cumulative net realizable value write downs of million and million  respectively 
the increase is primarily the result of including serologicals inventories in the valuation 
should it be determined that write downs are insufficient  we would be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have a negative impact on gross margin 
once recorded  inventory valuation provisions are not subsequently reversed unless the related inventory items are subsequently sold 
valuation of long lived assets 
valuation of certain long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill  requires significant judgment 
assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
a significant portion of the purchase price in our acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets and goodwill 
assigning value to intangible assets requires that we use significant judgment in determining i the fair value  and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or non amortizable and  if the former  the period and the method by which the intangible assets will be amortized 
we utilize third party valuation experts to assist us in this process 
changes in the initial assumptions could lead to changes in amortization expense recorded in our future financial statements 
for intangible assets and property  plant and equipment  we assess the carrying value of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant changes or developments in strategy or operations which affect our intellectual or tangible properties 
should we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets and intangible assets may not be recoverable  we will measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount 
table of contents rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows  including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets 
we perform annual reviews in our second quarter for impairment of goodwill or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill may be considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds the reporting unit s fair value 
assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which required us to recognize share based payments to employees and directors as compensation expense using a fair value based method in the results of operations 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r and as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method pursuant to accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
therefore  no stock based employee compensation expense had been recorded in connection with the issuance of employee and director stock options as all options granted under these plans were fixed awards and had an exercise price equal to the market value of our common stock at the time of the grant 
stock based employee compensation expense relating to separation agreements for certain executive officers and the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units granted at no cost to the employees was reflected in net income 
we used the modified prospective method when we adopted sfas no 
r and  accordingly  did not restate the results of operations for the prior periods 
in the year ended december   compensation expense of million was recognized for all awards granted on or after january  as well as for the unvested portion of awards granted before january  stock based compensation expense is estimated as of the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of our stock options using the black scholes option pricing model and the fair value of our restricted stock awards and restricted stock units based on the quoted market price of our common stock 
we recognize the associated compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of the awards  net of estimated forfeitures 
forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical pre vesting forfeiture history and are updated on a quarterly basis to reflect actual forfeitures of unvested awards and other known events 
estimating the fair value for stock options requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected term  expected dividends and risk free interest rates 
the expected volatility rates are estimated based on historical volatilities of our common stock over a period of time that approximates the expected term of the options 
the expected term represents the average time that options are expected to be outstanding and is estimated based on the historical exercise  post vesting cancellation and expiration patterns of our stock options 
expected dividends are estimated based on our dividend history as well as our current projections 
the risk free interest rate for periods approximating the expected terms of the options is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
these assumptions will be updated at least on an annual basis or when there is a significant change in circumstances that could affect these assumptions 
income taxes 
we recognize income taxes when transactions are recorded in our consolidated statement of operations  with deferred taxes provided for items that are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax reporting purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in addition  we estimate our exposures relating to uncertain tax positions and establish reserves for such exposures when they become probable and reasonably estimable 
the valuation allowance is provided to reserve against the expiration of federal and state research credits  state investment credit carryforwards  some foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards  and capital loss 
table of contents carryforwards 
at december   we had million of federal research credit carryforwards reserved with a valuation allowance 
in addition  million of state research credit and net operating loss carryforwards are reserved with a valuation allowance 
at december   projections of future taxable income show that all remaining federal general business credits gbc will be utilized 
at december   we had gbc carryforwards of approximately million that expire in the years through we are a worldwide business 
we are subject to tax audits on a regular basis 
because significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes  we periodically assess our exposures related to our provision for income taxes and appropriately accrue taxes for contingencies that may result in potential tax obligations 
we believe our tax reserves are necessary to adequately reflect tax obligations which may arise out of current and future audits 
any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
in the normal course of business  we are examined by various tax authorities  including the irs 
in  the irs completed the examination phase of and and commenced examination of and although the outcome of these examinations cannot currently be determined  we believe adequate provision has been made for any potential unfavorable financial statement impact 
we provide for us income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely invested outside the us as we repatriated approximately million of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of in december  there were no cumulative earnings outside the us upon which us income taxes had not been provided as of december  under apb  during  the earnings of our ireland subsidiaries were considered indefinitely invested outside the us also  beginning in the third quarter  in addition to the earnings of our ireland subsidiaries  we elected to treat the earnings of our united kingdom and sweden subsidiaries as indefinitely invested outside the us these elections were made based on our operating plans and foreign debt service requirements 
employee retirement plans 
in the us  we sponsor a pension plan and a postretirement medical plan covering substantially all employees who meet certain eligibility requirements 
for both plans  we determine several assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of the plans 
for the pension plan  these key assumptions include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  and rate of future compensation increases 
in selecting the expected long term rate of return on assets  we considered the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan 
this included considering the trusts asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of this plan 
the assumed discount rate is intended to approximate the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled 
we used the citigroup pension discount curve as the benchmark rate for estimating our discount rate for pension expense 
in addition  our actuarial advisors determine the expense and liabilities of the plan using additional assumptions for future experience  such as withdrawal and mortality assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by us in future years 
during  we recognized our pension expense using a discount rate of percent for months and percent for two months  an expected return on plan assets of percent and a rate of future compensation increases of percent related to our us pension plan 
the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our us pension plan were the discount rates and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
although they were the most sensitive assumptions  a basis point change in either assumption would be immaterial to our results of operations and financial condition 
for the postretirement medical plan  significant assumptions included the discount rate and the future medical cost escalation rate 
our actuarial consultants also employ additional assumptions for future experience  such as withdrawal and mortality 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from future actual 
table of contents results due to changing conditions in the growth of medical expenses or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of postretirement medical expense recorded by us 
during  we recognized our expense using a discount rate of percent and an expected medical cost escalation rate that declines gradually from percent in to percent in although they are the most sensitive assumptions  a basis point change in either assumption would be immaterial to our results of operations and financial condition 
in certain foreign subsidiaries  we also sponsor pension plans for our employees 
accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of country specific assumptions for discount rates  expected returns on assets  and rates of compensation increases 
we apply a consistent methodology  year over year  in determining the key assumptions which  in addition to future experience assumptions such as withdrawal rates and mortality rates  are used by our actuaries to determine our liabilities and expenses for each of these plans 
the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our foreign pension plans are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
although they are the most sensitive assumptions  a basis point change in either assumption would be immaterial to our results of operations and financial condition 
in the fourth quarter  our board of directors approved an amendment to the retirement plan for employees of millipore corporation the retirement plan and the employees participation and savings plan the participation plan 
the effect of the amendment was to freeze the retirement plan effective december   after which no benefits will accrue 
we will provide eligible participants a one time final opportunity in early to transfer balances in their participation plan accounts to the retirement plan for the purpose of purchasing an annuity under the existing terms of the retirement plan 
we recognized a curtailment loss of million in the fourth quarter as a result of this amendment 
we used an assumption that percent of available balances in the participation plan will be transferred into the retirement plan for purposes of determining the curtailment loss associated with the amendment 
the percent assumption was selected based on a review of our actual transfer experience for the period as well as the transfer experience related to the spin off of our microelectronics business 
actual transfer experience was analyzed to determine the percentage by age grouping of available participation plan balances that were transferred to the retirement plan 
these percentages were then applied to projected balances by age grouping as of december  to determine the estimated balances that will be transferred by age grouping 
the total of the balances that were estimated to be transferred by age grouping represented percent of total projected plan balances as of december  we believe that this methodology for selecting the transfer assumption for purposes of determining the curtailment loss was reasonable and appropriate 
if the actual rate of transfer upon participants election in early differs from the assumed percent  the actuarial gain or loss will be amortized over the average service period of the plan participants 
the following table is for illustrative purposes only and shows the impact of the retirement plan curtailment on our operating results of a percentage point change in the assumed rate of transfer and percentage point change in the assumed discount rate used  respectively 
positive dollar amounts would have improved operating income  while a negative dollar amount would have reduced operating income 
in thousands assumed rate of transfer discount rate market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rate risk  and credit risk 
we manage these market risks through our normal financing and operating activities and  when appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in sales  net income  and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates represents a substantial risk to us because approximately percent of our business is conducted outside of the united states  generally in foreign currencies 
our primary risk management strategy is to use forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
the intent of this strategy is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying booked exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures 
principal hedged currencies include the euro  japanese yen and british pound 
the periods of these forward contracts typically span less than three months 
we held forward foreign exchange contracts with us dollar equivalent notional amounts totaling million at december  the fair value of these contracts was an unrealized net gain of million at december  our risk management policy allows for hedging our net investments in foreign subsidiaries  using both derivative and non derivative instruments 
on june   we issued million euro denominated senior notes which gives rise to foreign exchange risk when the debt is remeasured into us dollars at the end of each period 
as we designated this debt as an economic hedge of our net investments in european subsidiaries  the remeasurement gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income 
upon maturity  however  we could be exposed to significant exchange rate risk as we will be required to repay the debt at the then current market exchange rates  which could be higher or lower than the rates at which we borrowed the debt on june  a future percent strengthening or weakening of the euro against the us dollar will cause us to pay approximately million more or less than our us dollar obligation that was expected when we issued the notes on june  we do not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates in the normal course of our business operations as a result of our ongoing investing and financing activities  which include debt as well as cash and cash equivalents and other highly liquid marketable securities 
as of december   our debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings 
our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to our revolver  under which the interest rates on our current borrowings float with euro libor rates 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair value of our convertible notes is affected by our stock price 
the total estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt at december  was  million 
fair values were determined from available market prices  using current interest rates and terms to maturity 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by percent  the fair value of our long term debt would decrease or increase by approximately million 
we assess our interest rate risks on a regular basis and do not currently use financial instruments to mitigate these risks 
credit risk we are exposed to concentrations of credit risk in cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables 
cash and cash equivalents are placed with major financial institutions with high quality credit ratings 
the amount placed with any one institution is limited by policy 
trade receivables credit risk exposure is limited due to the large number of established customers and their dispersion across different geographies 
we are exposed to concentrations of credit risk in cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and trade receivables 
no single customer accounted for percent or more of our consolidated trade receivables as of december
