domestic segment sales in were million compared to million in while domestic heat exchange sales reflected higher than normal pre season orders in the first quarter  unit volume through the first nine months of the year was impacted by high fuel costs  which negatively impacted consumer driving activity which in turn impacted overall product demand during this period 
during the fourth quarter of  gas prices declined and driving activity increased  however for the full year of  miles driven was again essentially flat with  which had also been flat with in addition  the company continues to experience the impact of ongoing competitive pricing pressure on its domestic heat exchange products 
despite this pressure  the company has been taking pricing actions  to the extent that the markets allow  in an effort to offset rising commodity costs 
the domestic marketplace is also experiencing a change in that more sales are being directed towards wholesale customers 
as a result of this shift in customer mix  the company experienced lower sales through its branch locations  which translate into lower average selling prices for its domestic heat exchange products 
while domestic air conditioning sales benefited from higher pre season orders from several of our major customers during the first quarter of  this was offset by a shorter than typical summer air conditioning parts selling season due to milder weather conditions 
air conditioning unit volume has also been adversely influenced by the impacts of high fuel costs and local competition

while copper prices declined during the fourth quarter of  this impact will not be reflected in the company s financial results until due to the turnover of inventory 
margins in benefited from the incremental level of branch sales for the full year  added as a result of the modine merger  which are at higher margins  but are offset by higher levels of branch operating expenses 
however  in the second half of  the company has begun to experience a shift in the customer mix of sales  away from the branch locations and to our wholesale customer base  which generate a lower gross margin as a percentage of sales 
during the fourth quarter of  the company changed the way that it estimated the period over which capitalized product cost variances should be written off in order to have costs more closely match the turnover and sale of product 
as a result of this change million of costs which would have been included in inventory at december   were included in cost of sales 
as a result of production cutbacks made at manufacturing facilities during the fourth quarter of in order to lower inventory levels and reflect the shift of production from copper brass to aluminum radiator construction  million of unabsorbed overhead variances were included in cost of sales

t he agreement does not affect the amount of minimum excess availability that the company is required to maintain 
the company has also committed to proceed to obtain additional debt financing from new lenders  the proceeds of which will be used to reduce the principal amount of indebtedness of the term b loan from million to million and for general working capital purposes 
although the company anticipates these improvements with its financial package will be completed in the near future  there can be no assurance as to whether or when these improvements will materialize 
the future liquidity and ordinary capital needs of the company in the short term are expected to be met from a combination of cash flows from operations and borrowings under the existing loan agreement 
the company s working capital requirements peak during the second and third quarters  reflecting the normal seasonality in the automotive and light truck product lines 
changes in market conditions  the effects of which may not be offset by the company s actions in the short term  could have an impact on the company s available liquidity and results of operations 
the company has 
table of contents taken actions during to improve its liquidity and is attempting to take additional actions  however there can be no assurance that they will be consummated on a timely basis  or at all 
in addition  the company s future cash flow may be impacted by the discontinuance of currently utilized customer sponsored payment programs 
the loss of one or more of the company s significant customers or changes in payment terms to one or more major suppliers could also have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and future liquidity 
the company utilizes customer sponsored programs administered by financial institutions in order to accelerate the collection of funds and offset the impact of extended customer payment terms 
the company intends to continue utilizing these programs as long as they are a cost effective tool to accelerate cash flow 
the company believes that its cash flow from operations  together with borrowings under its loan agreement  will be adequate to mee t its near term anticipated ordinary capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
however  the company believes that the amount of borrowings available under the loan agreement would not be sufficient to meet the capital needs for major growth initiatives  such as significant acquisitions 
if the company were to implement major new growth initiatives  it would have to seek additional sources of capital 
however  no assurance can be given that the company would be successful in securing such additional sources of capital

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
a company s critical accounting estimates  as set forth by the us securities and exchange commission  are those which are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and often require the utilization of estimates or subjective judgment 
based upon this definition  we have identified the critical accounting estimate s addressed below 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company also has other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  which are further described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein 

table of contents revenue recognition 
sales are recognized either when products are shipped to the customer or when products are received by the customer in accordance with the invoice shipping terms 
sales are recorded net of sales rebates  cash discounts  returns and advertising and other allowances 
accruals for warranty costs  sales returns and allowances are provided at the time of sale based upon historical experience or agreements currently in place with customers 
the company will also accrue for unusual warranty exposures at the time the exposure is identified and quantifiable based upon analyses of expected product failure rates and engineering cost estimates 
in connection with multi year agreements with certain customers  the company incurs customer acquisition costs which are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement 
the company also establishes reserves for uncollectible trade accounts receivable based upon historical experience  anticipated business trends and the current economic conditions 
customer account balances are written off at the time they are deemed fully uncollectible 
changes in our customers financial condition or other factors could cause our estimates of uncollectible accounts receivable or the amortization periods of customer acquisition costs to vary 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
this requires the company to make judgments about the likely method of disposition of its inventory and expected recoverable value upon disposition 
inventories are reviewed on a continuing basis  and provisions are also made for slow moving and obsolete inventory based upon estimates of historical or expected usage as well as the expected recoverable value upon disposition 
impairment of long lived assets 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of a business unit s long lived assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability would be performed 
if an evaluation is required  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the business unit  associated with the long lived assets  would be compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if a write down is required 
if this review indicates that the assets will not be recoverable  the carrying value of the company s assets would be reduced to their estimated fair value 
the estimates used in determining whether an impairment exists involve future cash flows of each business unit  which are based upon expected revenue trends  cost of production and operating expenses 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that those such assets will not be realized 
changes to the valuation allowance are based on the evaluation of all available evidence supporting the company s ability to utilize tax benefits prior to their expiration 
pension plans 
the company establishes and periodically reviews the assumptions used in the measurement of its domestic and foreign retirement plans 
the discount rate used in the assumption will change in relation to increases or decreases in applicable published bond indices 
at december   the discount rate for domestic plans was  which was developed by matching yields on selected highly rated aaa or aa corporate bonds with benefit payment streams of the company s plans 
the return on assets for domestic plans reflects the long term rate of return on plan assets expected to be realized over a ten year or longer period 
as such  it will normally not be adjusted for short term trends in the stock or bond markets 
in addition  the rate of return will reflect the investment allocation currently used to manage the pension portfolio 
the company s domestic pension plan assumptions currently include a long term annual rate of return  which is based upon the current portfolio allocation  long term rates of return for similar investment vehicles and economic and other indicators of future performance 
each increase or decrease in the expected rate of return assumption would decrease or increase the net periodic plan cost by million 
differences between actual and assumed portfolio performance as well as the impact of changes in discount rates are included in the calculation of the company s accrued pension costs by a third party actuary 
in the future  the domestic plan unrecognized net loss  of million at december   along with changes in any of the underlying pension assumptions  and the ongoing performance of the plan assets  will impact future funding requirements  minimum pension liability adjustments and net pension cost amounts 
absent any other changes  a change in the discount rate increases or 
table of contents decreases pension expense by million per year and the pension benefit obligation by million 
other material assumptions which are reviewed annually include the compensation increase rates  rates of employee termination and rates of participant mortality 
in  the company changed the mortality table which it utilizes from the group annuity mortality table to the rp mortality table  in order to better match current mortality levels 
the impact of this change was a million increase in the pension benefit obligation at december  and a million increase in the minimum pension adjustment reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  loss reserves 
the company has other loss exposures such as self insurance  environmental and litigation for which it determines the need and amount of reserves 
reserves are established using estimates  judgments and consistent methodologies to determine the exposure and ultimate potential liability 
inflation the overall impact of the low rate of united states inflation in recent years has resulted in no significant impact on labor costs and general services utilized by the company 
the principal raw materials used in the company s replacement radiator and heater core product lines are copper and brass 
the company also uses aluminum for its radiator  charge air cooler  condenser and heater core product lines 
copper  brass  aluminum and other primary metals used in the company s business are generally subject to commodity pricing and variations in the market prices for such materials 
although these materials are available from a number of vendors  the company has chosen to concentrate its sources with a limited number of l ong term suppliers 
the company typically executes purchase orders for its copper and brass requirements three to nine months prior to the actual delivery date 
in periods of abnormally high commodity market prices  the company will place orders only for its current requirements 
in either case  the purchase price for such copper  brass and aluminum is established at the time such orders are placed by the company and not at the time of delivery 
the company also manages its metals commodity pricing exposure by attempting to pass through any cost increases to its customers 
during the last four years  commodity prices increased significantly over the prior year 
while the company has been successful in passing through some price increases on its heavy duty products  on its automotive and light truck heat exchange products  it has been unable to do so 
as a result  the company has been forced to generate other cost reduction activities in order to offset these impacts 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in raising prices to its customers in the future or that it will be able to generate sufficient cost reductions to offset rising commodity prices 
the company currently does not use financial derivatives or other methods to hedge transactions with respect to its metals consumption 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  foreign  state and local laws designed to protect the environment and believes that  as a general matter  its policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to reasonably prevent risk of environmental damage and financial liability to the company 
on january   the company signed a consent agreement with the state of connecticut department of environmental protection 
under the agreement the company will voluntarily initiate the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination on property occupied by a wholly owned subsidiary of the company over years ago 
the company also believes there will not be any material adverse impact to its financial results due to the inves tigation and cleanup activities 
the company also believes it is reasonably possible that environmental related liabilities might exist with respect to other industrial sites formerly owned or occupied by the company 
based upon information currently available  the company believes that the cost of any potential remediation for which the company may ultimately be responsible will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity of the company 
the company currently does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations  financial condition or competitive position as a result of compliance with federal  state  
table of contents local or foreign environmental laws or regulations 
however  risk of environmental liability and charges associated with maintaining compliance with environmental laws is inherent in the nature of the company s business  and there is no assurance that material environmental liabilities and compliance charges will not arise 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and will result in financial statements reflecting the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions 
the company is currently evaluating what impact  if any  this will have on our reported results  however  the company does not expect that adoption of this interpretation will have a material impact on its results of operations 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb statement fas employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
fas requires the company to show the funded status of its pension and retiree health care plans as a prepaid asset or accrued liability  and to show the net deferred and unrecognized gains and losses related to the retirement plans  net of tax  as part of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
previously  the net deferred and unrecognized gains and losses were netted in the prepaid asset or accrued liability recorded for the retirement plans 
the statement als o requires that the pension valuation be performed as of the company s year end  which requirement had no impact on the company as that was the date previously used 
the company adopted the provisions of fas  as required  at december  for its domestic and foreign pension plans 
the impact of adopting fas for the company s domestic and foreign plans was an increase in the charge to accumulated other comprehensive income of million and million  respectively  at december  the foreign plan impact is net of million of foreign income taxes 
also  in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab concerning the quantification of misstatements in financial statements 
this is effective for years ending after november  and requires registrants to perform both of the two acceptable approaches in quantifying misstatements 
the rollover approach focuses on the amount by which the current year income statement is misstated while the iron curtain approach focuses on the misstatement of the balance sheet 
previously  a registrant could use one or the other approach to determine whether a misstatement had a material impact 
adoption o f this sab did not have any impact on the company s reported results 
the pension protection act of ppa was signed by the president and enacted in august  the ppa will change the method for determining minimum pension contributions and certain plan reporting commencing in calendar year while the company is currently evaluating the impact that the ppa will have on future contributions  it is not expected to have a material impact

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has certain exposures to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit and commodities 
the company s interest rate risk is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
at december   the company had a loan agreement  under which million was outstanding 
the weighted average interest rate on the loan agreement during was 
interest on the loan agreement is based on  at the company s option  the eurodollar loan rate plus a eurodollar margin or the prime rate 
the eurodollar margin is between and 
the impact of a change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company has sales and manufacturing facilities in europe and mexico 
as a result  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the economic conditions in europe and mexico could affect financial results 
the company has accounted for transactions associated with these foreign operations in accordance with the guidance established under financial accounting standards no 
 foreign currency translation 
as of december   the company s foreign subsidiaries had net current assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency translation risk of million 
the potential decrease in the net current assets from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december  would be million 
this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely all move in the same direction relative to the dollar 
this assumption may overstate or understate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
the company is subject to a concentration of credit risk primarily with its trade accounts receivable 
the largest concentration is with retail customers in the company s domestic segment where the top five customers comprise of net sales in and of the outstanding trade accounts receivable balance at december  the loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company grants credit to customers who meet pre established credit requirements  and generally requires no collateral from its customers 
estimates of potential credit losses are based upon historical experience  customer information and management s expectations of the industry and the overall economy 
as of december   the company had no other significant concentration of credit risk 
certain risks may arise in the various commodity markets in which the company participates 
commodity prices in the copper  brass and aluminum markets may be subject to changes based on availability 
the company conducts its purchasing of such commodities generally through three to nine month purchase order commitments  however  this practice may be modified in periods of rising prices 
see raw materials and suppliers in item of this report and inflation in item of this report for additional information on commodity purchasing
