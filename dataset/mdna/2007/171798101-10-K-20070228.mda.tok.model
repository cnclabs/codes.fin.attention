item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction cimarex energy co 
is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company  with operations focused mainly in oklahoma  texas  new mexico  kansas  louisiana  and the gulf of mexico 
our primary focus is exploration and development drilling for new reserves 
to supplement our growth  we also consider mergers and acquisitions 
on june   cimarex acquired magnum hunter resources  inc  a dallas based independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations concentrated in the permian basin of west texas and new mexico and in the gulf of mexico 
terms of the merger agreement provided that magnum hunter stockholders receive shares of cimarex common stock for each share of magnum hunter common stock 
as a result of the merger  cimarex issued million common shares to magnum hunter s common stockholders and assumed million of debt 
the merger was accounted for as a purchase of magnum hunter by cimarex 
results of operations from magnum hunter s properties are included in our consolidated statements of operations beginning june  our e d expenditures totaled  million for  up from million in operationally  we now have a large base of properties in the permian basin with operational characteristics similar to our mid continent assets 
the merger also extended our onshore gulf coast activities into the gulf of mexico 
overall  about percent of our proved reserves are in the permian basin and percent are in our mid continent region 
our onshore gulf coast and gulf of mexico operations collectively make up percent of our proved reserves 
industry and economic factors in managing our business we must deal with many factors inherent in our industry 
first and foremost is wide fluctuation of oil and gas prices 
oil and gas markets are cyclical and volatile  with future price movements difficult to predict 
while our revenues are a function of both production and prices  wide swings in prices often have the greatest impact on our results of operations 
our operations entail significant complexities 
advanced technologies requiring highly trained personnel are utilized in both exploration and production 
even when the technology is properly used  the interpreter still may not know conclusively if hydrocarbons will be present or the rate at which they will be produced 
exploration is a high risk activity  often times resulting in no commercially productive reservoirs being discovered 
moreover  costs associated with operating within the industry are substantial and usually move up and down together with prices 
the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
we compete with major and diversified energy companies  independent oil and gas companies  and individual operators 
in addition  the industry as a whole competes with other businesses that supply energy to industrial  commercial  and residential end users 
extensive federal  state  and local regulation of the industry significantly affects our operations 
in particular  our activities are subject to comprehensive environmental regulations 
compliance with these regulations increases the cost of planning  designing  drilling  installing  operating  and abandoning oil and gas wells and related facilities 
these regulations may become more demanding in the future 
approach to the business profitable growth largely depends upon our ability to successfully find and develop new proved reserves 
to achieve an overall acceptable rate of growth  we maintain a blended portfolio of low  moderate  and higher risk exploration and development projects 
we believe that this approach allows for consistent increases in our oil and gas reserves  while minimizing the chance of failure 
to further mitigate risk  we have chosen to seek geologic and geographic diversification by operating in multiple basins 
we may also consider the use of transaction specific hedging of oil and gas prices to reduce price risk 
in connection with the acquisition of magnum hunter  we acquired existing commodity derivatives  as well as in the third quarter of we entered into additional derivative contracts as discussed more fully below 
implementation of our business approach relies on our ability to fund ongoing exploration and development projects with cash flow provided by operating activities  periodic sales of non core properties  and external sources of capital 
we project that exploration and development expenditures will range from million to billion 
approximately percent of the expenditures will be in the mid continent area  percent in the permian basin  percent in the gulf coast area  and percent in the gulf of mexico 
cash flow from operating activities for totaled million  which helped to fund our drilling program 
based on expected cash provided by operating activities and monies available under our senior secured revolving credit facility  we believe we are well positioned to fund the projects identified for and beyond 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in response to sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and gas revenues  reserves and properties  as well as goodwill and contingencies  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition oil and gas sales revenue from the sale of oil and gas is recognized when title passes  net of royalties 
this is known as the sales method versus the entitlement method 
under the sales method  revenue is recognized on actual volumes sold to purchasers 
there is a ready market for oil and gas  with sales occurring soon after production 
marketing sales cimarex markets and sells natural gas for working interest partners under short term sales and supply agreements and earns a fee for such services 
revenues are recognized as gas is delivered and are reflected net of gas purchases on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
gas imbalances we use the sales method of accounting for gas imbalances 
under this method  revenue is recorded on the basis of gas actually sold 
oil and gas reserves are adjusted to the extent there are sufficient quantities of natural gas to make up an imbalance 
in situations where there are insufficient reserves available to make up an overproduced imbalance  then a liability is established 
the natural gas imbalance liability at december  and was million and million  respectively 
at december  we are also in an under produced position relative to certain other third parties 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures 
for  revisions of reserve estimates equaled a decrease of mbbls of oil and bcf of gas due to lower oil and gas prices  representing two and one half percent of proved oil and gas reserves as of december  see note  supplemental oil and gas disclosures for reserve data 
we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties 
changes in reserve quantities will cause corresponding changes in depletion expense in periods subsequent to the quantity revision or  in some cases  a full cost ceiling limitation charge in the period of the revision 
to date  changes in expense resulting from changes in previous estimates of reserves have not been material 
full cost accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations 
all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration  and development activities are capitalized 
exploration and development costs include dry hole costs  geological and geophysical costs  direct overhead related to exploration and development activities  and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves 
salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the exploration and development of properties  as well as other internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration  and development activities  are also capitalized 
at the end of each quarter  a full cost ceiling limitation calculation is made whereby net capitalized costs related to proved properties less associated deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the present value discounted at ten percent of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves less estimated future production and development costs and related income tax expense 
future net revenues used in the calculation of the full cost ceiling limitation are determined based on current oil and gas prices and is adjusted for designated cash flow hedges if it is determined that net capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling limit 
if net capitalized costs subject to amortization were to exceed this limit  the excess would be charged to expense 
however  if commodity prices increase subsequent to period end and prior to issuance of the financial statements  these higher commodity prices will be used to determine if the capital costs are in fact impaired as of the end of the period 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires an annual impairment assessment 
a more frequent assessment is required if certain events occur that reasonably indicate an impairment may have occurred 
the volatility of oil and gas prices may cause more frequent assessments 
the impairment assessment requires us to make estimates regarding the fair value of goodwill 
the estimated fair value is based on numerous factors  including future net cash flows of our estimates of proved reserves as well as the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves 
if the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value  then a measurement of the loss must be performed  with any deficiency recorded as an impairment 
to date  no related impairment has been recorded 
derivatives sfas no  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
we determine the fair value of derivative contracts based on the stated contract prices and current and projected market prices at the determination date discounted to reflect the time value of money until settlement 
the accounting treatment for the changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge for accounting treatment purposes 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in costs and expenses associated with operating income in our consolidated statements of operations 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  changes in the fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is settled 
changes in the fair value of the hedge resulting from ineffectiveness are recognized currently as unrealized gains or losses in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
gains and losses upon settlement of the cash flow hedges will be recognized in gas revenues in the period the contracts are settled 
in connection with the magnum hunter merger  cimarex recognized a million net liability associated with magnum hunter s existing commodity derivatives at the merger date june  
these derivative instruments were not designated for hedge accounting treatment 
as a result  cimarex recognized a net gain for the year ended december  of million 
activity included both non cash mark to market derivative gains and losses as well as cash settlements 
cash payments related to these contracts that settled in the year ended december  was million 
as of december   all derivative contracts assumed with the magnum hunter merger had matured 
in the third quarter of  we entered into additional derivative contracts to mitigate a portion of our potential exposure to adverse market changes in an environment of volatile gas prices 
using zero cost collars with mid continent weighted average floor and ceiling prices of to for and to for  we hedged million mmbtu and million mmbtu of our anticipated mid continent gas production for and  respectively 
at december   this represented approximately and of our current anticipated mid continent gas production for and  respectively 
under the collar agreements  we will receive the difference between an agreed upon mid continent index price and floor price if the index price is below the floor price 
we will pay the difference between the agreed upon contracted ceiling price and the index price only if the index price is above the contracted ceiling price 
no amounts are paid or received if the index price is between the contracted floor and ceiling prices 
these hedges have been designated for hedge accounting treatment as cash flow hedges 
for the year ended december   we recorded an unrealized loss of thousand related to the ineffective portion of the hedges 
at december   million and million of the hedges were recorded as current and long term assets  respectively  and an unrealized gain net of deferred income taxes of million was recorded in other comprehensive income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and item a of this report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments 
depending on changes in oil and gas futures markets and management s view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends  we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions 
contingencies a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes subjective judgment 
in many cases  this judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
we closely monitor known and potential legal  environmental  and other contingencies and periodically determine when we should record losses for these items based on information available to us 
as of december   we have accrued million for a mediated litigation settlement pertaining to post production deductions on properties operated by cimarex 
we have also accrued an additional million for a mediated litigation settlement pertaining to oil and gas property title issues 
we anticipate payment of both settlements during cimarex has other various litigation related matters in the normal course of business  none of which that can be estimated are deemed to be material  individually or in aggregate 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
asset retirement obligations the company recognizes the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made  and the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
oil and gas producing companies incur this liability which includes costs related to the plugging of wells  the removal of facilities and equipment  and site restorations  upon acquiring or drilling a successful well 
subsequent to initial measurement  the asset retirement liability is required to be accreted each period 
capitalized costs are depleted as a component of the full cost pool 
recent accounting developments in july  the fasb issued interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the company s financial statements in accordance with sfas accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
along with these disclosures  a tabular presentation of significant changes during each period will be required 
the interpretation is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after december  january  for calendar year companies 
we are currently evaluating the effects of implementing this interpretation and do not believe the adoption of this interpretation will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
regarding the process of quantifying misstatements within a financial statement  addressing in particular materiality analysis related to the correction of errors 
the impact on the current year financial statements of correcting all misstatements  including both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements  must be quantified 
adjustment would be required if the misstatement is deemed material  after considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors 
the periods in which the correction would be recorded would be dependent on the materiality considerations for each affected period 
this did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
also in september the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 fair value measurements  which establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement applies only to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards and is expected to increase the consistency of those measurements 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of statement no 
to have a material impact on our financial statements 
overview our results of operations are primarily impacted by changes in oil and gas prices and changes in our production volumes 
realized gas prices decreased from per mcf in to per mcf in  and oil prices increased from per barrel in to per barrel in cimarex also sells gas on behalf of third parties that are incidental to sales of our own production 
sales and costs associated with our production are reflected in gas sales and transportation expense 
we also own interests in gas gathering systems and gas processing plants that are connected to our production operations 
we transport and process third party gas that is associated with our gas 
transportation expenses are comprised of costs paid to carry and deliver oil and gas to a specified delivery point 
in some cases we receive a payment from purchasers which is net of transportation costs  and in other instances we separately pay for transportation 
if costs are netted in the proceeds received  both the gross revenues and gross costs are shown in sales and expenses  respectively 
production costs are composed of lease operating expenses  which generally consist of pumpers salaries  utilities  water disposal  maintenance and other costs necessary to operate our producing properties 
taxes  other than income  are taxes assessed by state and local taxing authorities pertaining to production  revenues or the value of properties 
these typically include production severance  ad valorem and excise taxes 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of our producing properties is computed using the units of production method 
because the economic life of each producing well depends upon the assumed price for future sales of production  fluctuations in oil and gas prices may impact the level of proved reserves used in the calculation 
higher prices generally have the effect of increasing reserves  which reduces depletion expense  while lower prices generally have the effect of decreasing reserves  which increases depletion expense 
in addition  changes in estimates of reserve quantities and estimates of future development costs or reclassifications from unproved properties to proved properties will impact depletion expense 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  office rent  legal fees  consultants  systems costs and other administrative costs incurred in our offices 
while we expect such costs to increase with our growth  we expect such increases to be proportionately smaller than our production growth 
stock compensation expense consists of non cash charges resulting from the issuance of restricted stock and restricted stock units to certain employees and the expensing of stock options resulting from the adoption of sfas no

oil volumes averaged  barrels per day for  compared to  barrels per day in  resulting in increased revenues of million 
the increase in sales volumes between the periods of and is due to the inclusion of magnum hunter operations beginning june  date of acquisition and positive drilling results during and production volumes in the gulf of mexico and along the texas and louisiana gulf coast area were negatively impacted during the fourth quarter of as a result of hurricanes 
it is estimated to have negatively impacted fourth quarter production by to mmcf equivalent per day 
these volumes were brought back online throughout  and by the fourth quarter of less than one mmcf equivalent per day was shut in from the hurricane activity 
no oil and gas reserves have been lost as a result of the storms and the majority of associated repair costs will be covered by insurance

liquidity and capital resources cash flows our primary source of capital is cash flow generated from operating activities 
prices we receive for oil and gas sales and our level of production will impact these future cash flows 
no prediction can be made as to the prices we will receive 
production volumes will in large part be dependent upon the amount and results of future capital expenditures 
in turn  actual levels of capital expenditures may vary due to many factors  including drilling results  oil and gas prices  industry conditions  prices and availability of goods and services  and the extent to which proved properties are acquired

holders of the convertible notes may surrender their notes for conversion into a combination of cash and shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of certain circumstances  including if the price of our common stock has been trading above the fixed conversion price of per share

there is not an observable market for the notes 
based on an average common stock price of  management estimates the fair value of the notes at december  was approximately million or  per bond 
in addition to the holders right to redeem the notes if our common stock price is above the conversion price  the holders also have the right to require cimarex to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued interest on december    and the indenture agreement also provides cimarex with an option to redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued interest anytime after december  contractual obligations and material commitments at december   we had contractual obligations and material commitments as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt fixed rate interest payments operating leases drilling commitments asset retirement obligation other liabilities these amounts do not include interest on the million of bank debt outstanding at december  the weighted average interest rate at december  on the bank debt was approximately

we have excluded the long term asset retirement obligations because we are not able to precisely predict the timing of these amounts 
at december   we had a firm sales contract to deliver approximately four bcf of natural gas over the next eight months 
if this gas is not delivered  our financial commitment would be approximately million 
this commitment will fluctuate due to price volatility and actual volumes delivered 
however  we believe no financial commitment will be due based on our reserves and current production levels 
cimarex has other various delivery commitments in the normal course of business  none of which are individually material 
in aggregate these commitments have a maximum amount that would be payable  if no gas is delivered  of approximately million 
all of the commitments were routine and were made in the normal course of our business 
based on current commodity prices and anticipated levels of production  we believe that the estimated net cash generated from operations  coupled with the cash on hand and amounts available under our existing line of credit will be adequate to meet future liquidity needs  including satisfying our financial obligations and funding our operations and exploration and development activities 
outlook our projected exploration and development expenditure program ranging from million to billion will require a great deal of coordination and effort 
though there are a variety of factors that could curtail  delay or even cancel some of our drilling operations  we believe our projected program has a high degree of occurrence 
the majority of projects are in hand  drilling rigs are being scheduled  and the historical results of our drilling efforts in these areas warrant pursuit of the projects 
costs of operations on a per mcfe basis for are estimated to approximate levels realized in late should factors beyond our control change  our program and realized costs will vary from current projections 
these factors could include volatility in commodity prices  changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  weather conditions  governmental regulations and more 
production estimates for range from to mmcfe per day 
revenues will be dependent not only on the level of oil and gas actually produced  but also the prices that will be realized 
during  our realized prices averaged per mcf of gas and per barrel of oil 
prices can be very volatile and the possibility of realized prices being different than they were in is high 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk price fluctuations our results of operations are highly dependent upon the prices we receive for oil and gas production  and those prices are constantly changing in response to market forces 
nearly all of our revenue is from the sale of oil and gas  so these fluctuations  positive and negative  can have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
monthly gas price realizations during ranged from per mcf to per mcf 
oil prices ranged from per barrel to per barrel 
it is impossible to predict future oil and gas prices with any degree of certainty 
in third quarter  we entered into derivative contracts to mitigate a portion of our potential exposure to adverse market changes in the mid continent region  in an environment of volatile gas prices 
these arrangements  which were based on prices available in the financial markets at the time the contracts were entered into  will be settled in cash and will not require physical delivery of hydrocarbons 
these hedges have been designated for hedge accounting treatment as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
and therefore  gains and losses upon settlement of the hedges will be recognized in gas revenue in the period the contracts are settled 
we believe that we have sufficient production volumes such that the hedge contract transactions will occur as expected 
the following tables reflect the volumes  weighted average contract prices and fair values of the contracts we have in place as of december  we are exposed to risks associated with these contracts arising from volatility in commodity prices and the unlikely event of non performance by the counterparties to the agreements
