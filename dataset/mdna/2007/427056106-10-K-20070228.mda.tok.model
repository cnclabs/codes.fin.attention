notes and 
to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures 
critical accounting estimates the company s summary of significant accounting policies is provided in item the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires hercules to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
hercules evaluates its estimates on a regular basis  including those related to impairments of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  income taxes  contingencies  including those related to litigation  environmental issues  asset retirement obligations and asbestos lawsuits and claims  pension and other benefit obligations and stock based compensation 
hercules bases its estimates on various factors including historical experience  consultation and advice from third party subject matter experts and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management reviews significant estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
hercules believes that the following accounting estimates are critical due to the significant subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for the matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the effect of the estimates and assumptions on its consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company performs an annual assessment of its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
in addition  the company consistently considers factors including deterioration in future economic conditions  poor operating results in the reporting units  new or stronger competitors  or changes in technology that could indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets  thereby requiring an impairment in the future 
to assess impairment  the company compares its reporting units book values of net assets  including goodwill  to its fair value 
fair value is estimated using a combination of valuation approaches including the market value and income approaches 
income valuation methodologies are based on estimates of future cash flows discounted using a credit adjusted risk free rate of return discount rate that essentially represents the company s cost of capital 
the estimate of future cash flows inherently involves significant management judgment as it represents a forecast of future events 
in addition  the discount rate is also subject to change from year to year based on the relative balance of debt and equity  actual rates of interest on outstanding debt and the company s stock price 
any change in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the discounted cash flows underlying the company s valuations 
other long lived assets the company tests other long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  for impairment based on an assessment of factors including deterioration in future economic conditions  poor operating results in a business  the determination that the long lived asset is unsuitable for one reason or another  new or stronger competitors  or changes in technology  that could indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset  thereby requiring an impairment in the future 
in some cases  the underlying assessment is subjective in nature and represents a significant degree of judgment 

table of contents deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized after consideration of future taxable income and reasonable tax planning strategies 
in the event that hercules were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance had not been established  or is able to utilize capital and or operating loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance had been established  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be reflected in income in the period such determination is made 
environmental matters and asset retirement obligations hercules establishes reserves for environmental matters and asset retirement obligations when a legal obligation exists and the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  the company recognizes a loss for environmental related litigation and other contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
the actual costs will depend upon numerous factors  including the estimated useful life of the company s manufacturing facilities and significant component assets  changes in the nature or use of existing assets and facilities  the number of parties found responsible at each environmental site and their ability to pay  the actual methods of remediation required or agreed to  outcomes of negotiations with regulatory authorities  outcomes of litigation  changes in the timing of required remedial activities  changes in the discount rates used to determine the fair value of obligations  changes in environmental laws and regulations  technological developments  the years of remedial activity required and changes in the number or financial exposures of claims  lawsuits  settlements or judgments  or in the ability to reduce such financial exposures by collecting indemnity payments from insurers 
each factor is considered sensitive to variation which could impact estimates of the timing and amount of cash flows 
asbestos related contingencies hercules has established reserves for asbestos related personal injury lawsuits and claims based upon the results of an annual actuarial study of its asbestos related liabilities by a recognized expert at a major national university 
this study is based on a number of assumptions including the number of future claims  the timing and amount of future payments  disease  venue  and the dynamic nature of asbestos litigation and other circumstances 
while the expert noted above has applied his methodology in determining the company s reasonably possible range of exposures for these liabilities on a consistent basis  other methods in practice exist which place a differing degree of emphasis on the underlying variables used to measure asbestos related contingencies 
such other methods could yield significantly different ranges of reasonably possible exposures 
pension and other postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the related expense income are determined based upon actuarial assumptions regarding mortality  medical inflation rates  discount rates  long term return on assets  salary increases  medicare availability and other factors 
changes in these assumptions can result in changes to the recognized pension and other postretirement benefits expense and recorded liabilities 
the assets and liabilities associated with the company s defined benefit plans are subject to interest rate and market risk 
a basis point decrease or increase in the discount rate has an unfavorable or favorable impact of approximately million on the us defined benefit plan s projected benefit obligation 
a basis point decrease or increase in the assumed rate of return has an unfavorable or favorable impact of approximately million on the estimated expense for the us pension and postretirement plans in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options issued as compensation 
the model determines a fair value based on a number of key variables including the grant date price of hercules common stock and the related exercise or strike price  estimated dividend yield  estimated term of the option prior to exercise  risk free rate of interest over the estimated term and a measure of the volatility of hercules common stock over the estimated term 
certain of these variables encompass a degree of subjectivity whose variability could result in significantly different values for the grant date fair value of stock option awards 
in addition  the charge for compensation cost associated with stock options as well as restricted stock is based upon the number of awards that are expected to vest 
this measure implicitly includes an estimate for forfeitures based on employee turnover  reductions in force and other factors specific to the award recipient population 
accordingly  the company has developed an estimate for forfeitures based on recent historical experience rates that incorporate the different forfeiture and exercise patterns of officers and all other employees

in order to maintain production and commitments to customers  alternative supply sources were utilized resulting in significantly higher cost and transportation charges

in the aggregate  price increases of million exceeded raw material cost increases of million  resulting in a recovery of during paper technologies sales increased during as compared to the increase reflects higher volumes  increased pricing and favorable rates of exchange partially offset by an unfavorable product mix 
higher volumes are primarily attributable to the marketing and manufacturing alliance for rosin size products partially offset by the continuing impact of customer bankruptcies and mill closures  particularly in southern europe 
price increases have been achieved in all regions of the world with the largest increase attributable to the americas 
the unfavorable product mix reflects higher sales of lower priced functional products in both north america and emerging asia markets 
venture sales increased during as compared to the increase reflects improved product mix as well as higher pricing and favorable rates of exchange partially offset by lower volume 
the improved mix reflects higher sales of water management  lubricants and adhesive products 
ptv s success with new product launches and increasing selling prices to reflect value in both the process and functional products families represents a continuing trend as the segment has commercialized an expanding portfolio of new products and applications  including many that are environmentally friendly and are therefore more highly valued in certain regions 
most of these products provide substantially higher margins 
on an aggregated basis  revenues from new product introductions during increased approximately over overall  approximately of ptv s total revenues were derived from products that are less than five years old 
profit from operations increased million  or  to million during as compared to million for the increase reflects higher volume and improved selling prices  which contributed to the recovery of higher raw material  transportation and energy costs 
in addition  ptv incurred lower sg a expenses primarily as a result of the significant restructuring actions taken during the current and prior year

these decreases were partially offset by higher corporate support costs  primarily related to incentive compensation  as well as bad debt accruals 
primarily as a result of the rapid escalation in costs experienced in the second half of and continuing into  overall costs for raw materials  transportation and energy for increased million over levels 
in addition to energy related price pressure  supply for certain raw materials in certain regions remains constrained 
in particular  crude tall oil rosin prices remain at high levels due to high demand and limited supply  particularly in europe 
increased demand for gum rosin in the asia pacific region  particularly due to domestic consumption in china and certain weather events  resulted in higher costs during additionally  pricing for adipic acid and epichlorohydrin continues to be stable at relatively high levels and prices for methanol have increased sharply due to outages and supplier force majeure actions 
with respect to restructuring actions  ptv recorded charges of million during for severance benefits and other exit costs primarily attributable to continuing efforts to de layer management and streamline the sales and marketing organization in connection with the segment realignment as well as the manufacturing rationalization attributable to ptv s rosin sizing product alliance transaction 
these costs also include charges attributable to the closing of the research facility in jacksonville  florida and its related relocation to wilmington  delaware 
ptv results reflect million of accelerated depreciation charges of which million is attributable to the closure of the pendlebury  united kingdom manufacturing facility during the three months ended march  the remaining million is related to the closing of the jacksonville facility and the shut down of certain production lines at manufacturing facilities in connection with the aforementioned alliance
