item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
unless otherwise noted  all dollar amounts are in millions and those relating to our results of operations are presented before taxes 
following the distributions of the shares of realogy corporation and wyndham worldwide corporation to our stockholders on july  and the sale of travelport  inc on august   which are further described below  we changed our name to avis budget group  inc our continuing operations consist primarily of our avis budget car rental  llc subsidiary  the parent company of the companies that comprise our vehicle rental operations  which provide car and truck rentals and ancillary services to businesses and consumers in the united states and internationally 
we operate in the following business segments domestic car rental provides car rentals and ancillary products and services in the united states 
international car rental provides car rentals and ancillary products and services primarily in canada  argentina  australia  new zealand  puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
truck rental provides truck rentals and related services to consumers and light commercial users in the united states 
our revenues are derived principally from car and truck rentals in our company owned operations and include i time and mileage t m fees charged to our customers for vehicle rentals  ii reimbursement from our customers for certain operating expenses we incur  including gasoline and vehicle licensing fees  as well as airport concession fees  which we pay in exchange for the right to operate at airports and other locations  and iii sales of loss damage waivers and insurance  and rentals of navigation units and other items in conjunction with vehicle rentals 
we also earn royalty revenue from our franchisees in conjunction with their vehicle rental transactions 
car rental volumes are closely associated with the travel industry  particularly airline passenger volumes  or enplanements 
because  we operate primarily in the united states and generate a significant portion of our revenue from our on airport operations  we expect that our ability to generate revenue growth will be somewhat dependent on increases in domestic enplanements 
we have also experienced significant per unit fleet cost increases on model year and vehicles  which have negatively impacted our margins 
accordingly  our ability to achieve profit margins consistent with prior periods remains dependent on our ability to successfully reflect corresponding changes in our pricing programs 
our vehicle rental operations are seasonal 
historically  the third quarter of the year has been our strongest quarter due to the increased level of leisure travel and household moving activity 
any occurrence that disrupts rental activity during the third quarter could have a disproportionately material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have a predominantly variable cost structure and routinely adjust the size and  therefore  the cost of our rental fleet in response to fluctuations in demand 
however  certain expenses  such as rent  are fixed and cannot be reduced in response to seasonal fluctuations in our operations 
we believe that the following trends  among others  may affect and or have impacted our financial condition and results of operations domestic enplanements  which remained relatively flat compared to  but are expected to increase modestly in  assuming there are no major disruptions in travel  
table of contents rising per unit car fleet costs  which we began to experience in and anticipate will continue with model year vehicles  pricing increases  which we instituted throughout in response to rising fleet costs and intend to continue to pursue  where appropriate  and our continued expansion in off airport  or local market segments  including insurance replacement rentals 
in and  we undertook a strategic realignment to simplify our business model through exiting non core businesses or businesses that produced volatility to our earnings inconsistent with our business model and the remainder of our core businesses 
we began this strategic realignment by completing the initial public offering of jackson hewitt tax service inc in june we completed the spin off of our former mortgage  fleet leasing and appraisal businesses in a tax free distribution of the common stock of phh corporation to our stockholders in january in february  we completed the initial public offering of wright express corporation  raising million of cash 
in october  we completed the sale of our marketing services division  which was comprised of our former individual membership and loyalty insurance marketing businesses  for approximately billion of cash approximately billion of gross proceeds  representing the culmination of our and strategic realignment 
following this strategic realignment  our management team and board of directors  with the aid of financial and legal advisors  performed a comprehensive review of the growth opportunities and estimated market valuations for each of our core businesses 
as a result of this review  from october to july  our board of directors approved a plan to separate cendant into four independent companies realogy corporation encompasses our former realogy segment  which is now presented as a discontinued operation 
wyndham worldwide corporation encompasses our former hospitality services and timeshare resorts segments  which are now presented as discontinued operations 
travelport  inc encompasses our former travel distribution services segment  which is now presented as a discontinued operation 
avis budget group  inc encompasses our vehicle rental operations 
on july   we completed the spin offs of realogy corporation and wyndham worldwide corporation in tax free distributions of one share each of realogy and wyndham common stock for every four and five shares  respectively  of then outstanding cendant common stock held on july  on august   realogy and wyndham stock began regular way trading on the new york stock exchange under the symbols h and wyn  respectively 
prior to the completion of the spin offs  we received special cash dividends of  million and  million from realogy and wyndham  respectively  and utilized such proceeds to fund a portion of the repayment of our outstanding debt  as discussed below 
on august   we completed the sale of travelport for proceeds of approximately billion  net of closing adjustments  of which approximately billion was used to repay indebtedness of travelport 
pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement  during third quarter  we distributed  million and million of such proceeds to realogy and wyndham  respectively 
in connection with executing our plan  we incurred costs of million and million during and  respectively 
these costs consist primarily of legal  accounting  other professional and consulting fees and various employee costs  and for include costs associated with the retirement of corporate debt 
in connection with our execution of the separation plan  we repaid certain corporate and other debt and entered into new financing arrangements  including i the completion of  million of fixed and floating rate 
table of contents financing by avis budget car rental ii the establishment of a billion revolving credit facility by avis budget car rental iii the completion of a tender offer for billion of our corporate debt by repurchasing approximately billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of our notes due in january and march  notes due in january and notes due in march and the subsequent redemption of the untendered portion of such debt and iv the repayment of aggregate principal of million due in august under our and notes 
as a result of the spin offs of realogy and wyndham  we repaid outstanding borrowings of million including million which was recorded within discontinued operations and million under our former billion revolving credit facility and asset linked facility  respectively  and terminated these facilities during july in connection with the separation  we entered into a separation agreement  tax sharing agreement and transition services agreement with realogy  wyndham and travelport 
on august   our stockholders approved certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation  including a change in our name from cendant corporation to avis budget group  inc and a for reverse stock split of our common stock  each of which became effective on the new york stock exchange at the opening of the market on september  and  at that time  our ticker symbol changed to car 
results of operations discussed below are our consolidated results of operations and the results of operations for each of our reportable segments 
generally accepted accounting principles require us to segregate and report as discontinued operations  for all periods presented  the account balances and activities of jackson hewitt  phh  wright express  our former marketing services division  realogy  wyndham and travelport 
previously  we could not classify our former mortgage business as a discontinued operation due to realogy s participation in a mortgage origination venture that was established with phh in connection with our january spin off of phh 
however  due to the spin off of realogy on july   this business is classified as a discontinued operation 
we measure performance using the following key operating statistics i rental days  which represents the total number of days or portion thereof a vehicle was rented  and ii t m revenue per rental day  which represents the average daily revenue we earned from rental and mileage fees charged to our customers 
our car rental operating statistics rental days and t m revenue per rental day are all calculated based on the actual usage of the vehicle during a hour period 
we believe that this methodology  while conservative  provides our management with the most relevant statistics in order to manage the business 
our calculation may not be comparable to other companies calculation of similarly titled statistics 
the reportable segments presented below represent our operating segments for which separate financial information is available and is utilized on a regular basis by our chief operating decision maker to assess performance and to allocate resources 
in identifying our reportable segments  we also consider the nature of services provided by our operating segments 
management evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon revenue and ebitda  which we define as income from continuing operations before non vehicle related depreciation and amortization  non vehicle related interest and income taxes 
our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

table of contents year ended december  vs 
year ended december  our consolidated results of operations comprised the following change net revenues total expenses loss before income taxes benefit from income taxes loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax gain loss on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax cumulative effect of accounting changes  net of tax net income loss during  our total revenues increased million principally due to a increase in t m revenue reflecting a increase in rental days and a increase in t m revenue per day within our car rental operations  partially offset by a reduction in truck rental days 
total expenses increased million principally reflecting separation related charges of million we incurred during and increased fleet depreciation and lease charges of million resulting from higher per unit fleet costs and a larger car rental fleet 
the separation charges relate primarily to the early extinguishment of debt  stock based compensation  severance and retention and legal  accounting  and other professional fees 
the year over year increase in total expenses also reflects i increases in operating costs associated with increased car rental volume and fleet size  including vehicle maintenance and damage costs  commissions and shuttling costs  and ii incremental expenses representing inflationary increases in rent  salaries and wages and other costs 
interest expense related to corporate debt increased million primarily due to the absence in of a million reversal of accrued interest during first quarter associated with the resolution of amounts due under a litigation settlement reached in we also incurred million of incremental corporate interest expense related to  million of borrowings by avis budget car rental in second quarter  which was substantially offset by a reduction in corporate interest expense resulting from the repayment of approximately billion of corporate debt in third quarter as a result of these items  as well as a million increase in our benefit from income taxes  our loss from continuing operations increased million 
our effective tax rate for continuing operations was a benefit of and for and  respectively 
the rate was higher due to the favorable resolution of prior years examination matters and state taxes 
selling  general and administrative expenses include unallocated corporate expenses related to the discontinued operations treatment of our former subsidiaries 
we will not incur the majority of these corporate costs going forward 
income from discontinued operations decreased million  which primarily reflects i a decrease of million in net income generated by realogy and wyndham in compared to these businesses were included in our results through july   the date of disposition  but were included in our results for the full year ended december  and ii the absence in of net income of million related to our former marketing services division this business was disposed in fourth quarter

the revenue increase of million was comprised of a million increase in t m revenue and a million increase in ancillary revenues 
the increase in t m revenue was principally driven by a increase in the number of days a car was rented and a increase in t m revenue per day 
we expect to realize continuing year over year price increases into as we seek to offset the impact of higher fleet costs and interest rates  which we began to experience in the second half of fleet depreciation and lease charges increased million in primarily due to i an increase of in the average size of our domestic rental fleet and ii increased per unit fleet costs for model year and vehicles compared  respectively  to model year and vehicles 
we incurred million more vehicle related interest expense during compared to  primarily due to a decrease in intercompany interest income 
the impact of rising interest rates was substantially offset by the reduction in vehicle related debt in april with the proceeds from our new corporate borrowings 
interest expense related to such corporate debt is not included in ebitda  whereas interest related to vehicle backed debt is included in ebitda 

table of contents the million increase in ancillary revenues was due primarily to i a million increase in counter sales of insurance and other items  ii a million increase in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenues  which was offset in ebitda by higher airport concession and vehicle licensing expenses remitted to airport and other regulatory authorities  and iii a million increase in gasoline revenues  which was offset in ebitda by million of additional gasoline costs 
ebitda from our domestic car rental operations also reflects i million of additional expenses primarily associated with increased car rental volume and fleet size  including vehicle maintenance and damage costs  ii million of incremental expenses primarily representing inflationary increases in rent  salaries and wages and other costs  iii million of incremental agency operator and credit card commission expense associated with increased t m revenue and iv million of separation related charges we incurred during primarily related to accelerated vesting of stock based compensation awards

international car rental revenues increased million while ebitda was unchanged in compared with  primarily reflecting growth in rental day volume and the impact on our results of franchisees acquired during or subsequent to  as discussed below 
our ebitda margins were negatively impacted by higher fleet and interest costs 
the revenue increase of million was comprised of a million increase in car rental t m revenue and a million increase in ancillary revenues 
the increase in t m revenue was principally driven by a increase in the number of days a car was rented which includes organic growth and a increase in t m revenue per day 
the favorable effect of incremental t m revenues was partially offset in ebitda by million of increased fleet depreciation and lease charges resulting from an increase of in the average size of our international rental fleet and increased per unit fleet costs 
we incurred million more vehicle related interest expense during compared to  primarily due to increased interest rates 
the million increase in ancillary revenues was due primarily to i a million increase in counter sales of insurance and other items  ii an million increase in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenues  the majority of which was offset in ebitda by higher airport concession and vehicle licensing expenses remitted to airport and other regulatory authorities  and iii a million increase in gasoline revenues  which was partially offset in ebitda by million of additional gasoline costs

the increases discussed above also include i million of revenue and million of ebitda losses resulting from our acquisitions of international franchisees during or subsequent to and ii a million increase in revenue related to favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  which was substantially offset in ebitda by the opposite impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on expenses 
truck rental revenues and ebitda declined million and million  respectively  for compared with  primarily reflecting lower rental day volume and lower t m revenue per day 
ebitda was also impacted by higher fleet costs 
substantially all of the revenue decrease of million was due to a decrease in t m revenue  which reflected a reduction in rental days and a decrease in t m revenue per day 
the reduction in rental days 
table of contents reflected declines primarily in commercial volumes and a reduction in the average size of our rental fleet 
despite the reduction in the average size of our truck rental fleet  reflecting our efforts to focus on newer and more efficient trucks  we incurred million of incremental fleet depreciation  interest and lease charges primarily due to higher per unit fleet costs 
ebitda was also unfavorably impacted by the absence of a million credit relating to a refinement made during in how we estimate repair and refurbishment costs of our truck fleet 
during  we recorded million of separation related charges  including debt termination and other costs 
these items were partially offset by i a million decrease in operating expenses primarily due to operating a smaller and more efficient fleet and reduced rental volumes  ii a million decrease in our public liability and property damage costs as a result of more favorable claims experience and a reduction in rental days  iii a decrease of million in credit card and other commission expense partially associated with decreased t m revenue and iv the absence of a million restructuring charge recorded in  which represented costs incurred in connection with the closure of a reservation center and unprofitable rental locations  which was more than offset by an million charge in principally related to the closure of the budget truck rental headquarters and other facilities and reductions in staff

ebitda was also unfavorably impacted year over year by a million increase in general and administrative costs in  including separation related charges  unallocated corporate expenses and executive salaries 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in incentive compensation costs in  and the absence in of million of restructuring charges recorded during year ended december  vs

as a result of these items  as well as a million decrease in our benefit from income taxes  our income from continuing operations decreased million 
the benefit from income taxes for and reflects the favorable resolution of prior years examination matters 
income from discontinued operations decreased million  which primarily reflects i a decrease of million in net income generated by travelport which reflects a million impairment charge recorded during partially offset by increased revenue  ii a decrease of million in net income generated by our marketing services division  which principally reflects the reversal of a tax valuation allowance of million in january  and iii a decrease of million in net income generated by phh this business was included in our results through january   the date of disposition  but was included in our results for all of

following is a more detailed discussion of the results of each of our reportable segments revenues ebitda change change domestic car rental international car rental truck rental total reportable segments corporate and other a total company less non vehicle related depreciation and amortization interest expense related to corporate debt  net b income loss before income taxes a includes unallocated corporate overhead  the elimination of transactions between segments and the results of operations of certain non strategic businesses 
b the amount includes a credit resulting from the reversal of million of accrued interest associated with the resolution of amounts due under a litigation settlement reached in domestic car rental revenues increased million while ebitda decreased million in compared with  primarily reflecting growth in rental day volume offset by both reduced t m revenue per rental day and higher fleet costs 

table of contents the revenue increase of million was comprised of a million increase in t m revenue and a million increase in ancillary revenues 
the increase in t m revenues was principally driven by a increase in rental days  partially offset by a decrease in t m revenue per day 
the increase in rental days reflects  in part  our strategic decision to implement more competitive pricing in the second half of this program was continued into the first half of when we instituted a price increase in response to rising fleet costs 
accordingly  t m revenue per day decreased during when compared with as a whole  but year over year price comparisons strengthened over the course of fleet depreciation  interest and lease charges increased million in primarily due to i an increase of in the average size of our domestic rental fleet and ii reductions to manufacturer incentives received on our model year rental car fleet which was utilized during as compared with those received on our model year rental car fleet which was utilized during 
we also incurred million of additional expenses primarily associated with increased car rental volume and fleet size  including vehicle maintenance and damage costs  commissions and shuttling costs 
the million increase in ancillary revenues was due primarily to i a million increase in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenues  which was more than offset in ebitda by million of higher airport concession and vehicle licensing expenses remitted to airport and other regulatory authorities  ii a million increase in counter sales of insurance and other items  and iii a million increase in gasoline revenues  which was more than offset in ebitda by million of higher gasoline costs 
ebitda from our domestic car rental operations also reflects million of incremental interest income earned on intercompany balances with our corporate parent  which was forgiven in connection with the separation  partially offset by i million of incremental expenses relating to the estimated damages caused by the hurricanes experienced in the gulf coast in and ii million of additional litigation expense resulting from the settlement of a dispute 
international car rental revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with  primarily reflecting growth in rental day volume 
the revenue increase of million was comprised of an million increase in t m revenue and a million increase in ancillary revenues 
the increase in t m revenues was principally driven by a increase in rental days and a increase in t m revenue per day 
the favorable effect of incremental t m revenues was partially offset in ebitda by million of increased fleet depreciation  interest and lease charges principally resulting from an increase of in the average size of our international rental fleet to support increased demand 
we also incurred million of additional expenses primarily associated with increased car rental volume and fleet size  including vehicle maintenance and damage costs  commissions and shuttling costs 
the million increase in ancillary revenues was due primarily to i a million increase in counter sales of insurance and other items  ii a million increase in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenues  substantially all of which are remitted to airport and other regulatory authorities thereby having a minimal impact on ebitda  and iii a million increase in gasoline revenues  which was more than offset in ebitda by million of higher gasoline costs 
the increases discussed above include million of revenue and million of ebitda losses resulting from our acquisitions of international franchisees during  as well as the effect of favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of million  which was largely offset in ebitda by the opposite impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on expenses 

table of contents truck rental revenues increased million  while ebitda decreased million in compared with the revenue increase of million was comprised of an million increase in t m revenue and an million increase in counter sales of insurance and other items 
the increase in t m revenues was principally driven by a increase in t m revenue per day and a modest increase in rental days 
the favorable effect of incremental t m revenues was more than offset in ebitda by million of increased fleet depreciation  interest and lease charges principally resulting from an increase of in the average size of our truck rental fleet and higher per unit fleet costs 
ebitda from our truck rental operations also reflects i million of additional dealer commission expense associated with increased t m revenue  as discussed above and ii million of restructuring costs  representing facility  employee relocation and severance costs incurred in connection with the closure of a reservation center and unprofitable budget truck rental locations 
these increases were partially offset by i a million credit relating to a refinement made during in how we estimate repair and refurbishment costs of our truck fleet and ii a million decrease in our self insurance reserve for public liability and property damage costs as a result of more favorable claims experience 
corporate and other revenues decreased million and the ebitda loss increased from million in to million in revenues and ebitda were unfavorably impacted in by a million reduction to realized gains on the sale of homestore stock during compared with and a million reduction in earnings on a credit card marketing program under which we earned fees based on a percentage of credit card spending 
such amounts were partially offset by a million increase in revenues earned in under agreements where we provided certain transitional administrative services to businesses we recently sold or distributed including jackson hewitt  phh and our former marketing services division 
ebitda was further unfavorably impacted year over year by i the absence of a million credit recorded in in connection with previously established liabilities for severance and other termination benefits for which we no longer believed we were liable  ii million in expenses recorded during in connection with our separation plan and iii a credit of million in relating to the termination of a lease on more favorable terms than originally estimated 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we present separately the financial data of our vehicle programs 
these programs are distinct from our other activities as the assets are generally funded through the issuance of debt that is collateralized by such assets 
assets under vehicle programs are funded through borrowings under asset backed funding or other similar arrangements 
the income generated by these assets is used  in part  to repay the principal and interest associated with the debt 
cash inflows and outflows relating to the generation or acquisition of such assets and the principal debt repayment or financing of such assets are classified as activities of our vehicle programs 
we believe it is appropriate to segregate the financial data of our vehicle programs because  ultimately  the source of repayment of such debt is the realization of such assets 

table of contents financial condition change total assets exclusive of assets under vehicle programs total liabilities exclusive of liabilities under vehicle programs assets under vehicle programs liabilities under vehicle programs stockholders equity total assets exclusive of assets under vehicle programs decreased approximately billion  principally due to i a billion decrease in assets of discontinued operations due to our completion of the spin offs of realogy and wyndham on july  and the sale of travelport on august  see note to our consolidated financial statements  ii a million decrease in deferred income taxes primarily due to utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and a decrease in certain tax items as a result of the separation during  and iii a decrease of million in cash and cash equivalents see liquidity and capital resources cash flows for a detailed discussion 
these decreases were partially offset by an million increase in other current and other non current assets primarily attributable to receivables recorded in third quarter related to certain contingent and other corporate liabilities assumed by realogy and wyndham in connection with the separation 
total liabilities exclusive of liabilities under vehicle programs decreased approximately billion  principally due to i a billion decrease in liabilities of discontinued operations due to the spin offs of realogy and wyndham and the sale of travelport  discussed above  ii the retirement of approximately billion of corporate debt during third quarter  in connection with the execution of our separation plan  iii a million decrease in income taxes payable  and iv a million decrease in litigation related accruals primarily resulting from the settlement of a litigation matter related to claims made by the purchaser of a business sold by avis prior to our acquisition of that company in and the settlement of a matter related to our former marketing services division 
these decreases were partially offset by the issuance of  million of fixed and floating rate notes and completion of an million term loan by avis budget car rental in april see liquidity and capital resources debt and financing arrangements for a detailed account of the change in our long term debt 
assets under vehicle programs decreased million primarily due to i a million decrease in vehicles principally within our domestic car rental operation and ii a million decrease in amounts due from vehicle manufacturers primarily associated with a reduction in the size of our rental fleet and growth in the portion of our rental fleet that is not subject to manufacturer repurchase and guaranteed depreciation agreements 
during  we also instituted a change in the manner in which we return certain vehicles to manufacturers under repurchase and guaranteed depreciation agreements  which reduced the duration between the sale of a vehicle and the receipt of related cash 
liabilities under vehicle programs decreased approximately billion  reflecting i the repayment of vehicle backed debt with substantially all of the net proceeds from the issuance of fixed and floating rate notes and term loan borrowings  discussed above  and ii a decrease in outstanding borrowings within our domestic car rental segment  reflecting a decrease in our rental fleet at december  compared to december   as discussed above 
stockholders equity decreased approximately billion primarily due to i the billion dividend of the aggregate equity of realogy and wyndham to our stockholders and ii a net loss of approximately billion including charges of approximately billion related to the sale of travelport and separation costs in we also repurchased million of common stock and paid cash dividends of million during these decreases were partially offset by a million increase to stockholders equity primarily related to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units during in connection with the separation 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and our ability to generate cash through operations and financing activities  including available funding arrangements and committed credit facilities  each of which is discussed below

we generated approximately billion more cash from investing activities during compared with this change is primarily due to i an increase of approximately billion related to payments received on vehicles repurchased by manufacturers partially offset by a million increase in vehicles purchased and ii a billion increase in cash proceeds from dispositions of businesses  net of transaction related payments  which reflects net proceeds of approximately billion we received in connection with the sale of travelport in  partially offset by billion and million in proceeds related to the disposition of our former marketing services division and the initial public offering of wright express in  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by a million payment made during associated with a litigation matter 
during  we expect to utilize at least billion of cash to purchase rental vehicles  which will primarily be funded with proceeds received on the sale of rental vehicles to manufacturers under our repurchase or guaranteed depreciation agreements  as well as borrowings under our vehicle backed debt programs 
we anticipate aggregate capital expenditure investments for to approximate million to million 
we used approximately billion more cash in financing activities in compared to such change principally reflects i a billion decrease in net borrowings to fund the acquisition of vehicles  consistent with the reduction in net vehicle purchases discussed above and ii the utilization of billion to repay corporate debt previously issued by cendant  partially offset by proceeds received in connection with the issuance of  million of fixed and floating rate notes in april these incremental cash outflows were partially offset by i a reduction in cash utilized for net repurchases of common stock and dividend payments of million and million  respectively  and ii the absence of million of cash used to repay short term borrowings during debt and financing arrangements at december   we had approximately billion of indebtedness including corporate indebtedness of approximately billion and debt under vehicle programs of approximately billion

liquidity risk we believe that access to our existing financing arrangements is sufficient to meet liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
our liquidity position may be negatively affected by unfavorable conditions in the vehicle rental industry 
additionally  our liquidity as it relates to vehicle programs could be adversely affected by i the deterioration in the performance of the underlying assets of such programs or ii increased costs associated with the principal financing program for our vehicle rental subsidiaries if general motors corporation or ford motor company is not able to honor its obligations to repurchase or guarantee the depreciation on the related vehicles 
access to our credit facilities may be limited if we were to fail to meet certain financial ratios or other requirements 
additionally  we monitor the maintenance of required financial ratios and  as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit facilities

table of contents b represents debt under vehicle programs including related party debt due to avis budget rental car funding  which was issued to support the purchase of vehicles 
c primarily represents commitments to purchase vehicles from either general motors corporation or ford motor company 
these commitments are subject to the vehicle manufacturers satisfying their obligations under the repurchase and guaranteed depreciation agreements 
the purchase of such vehicles is financed through the issuance of debt under vehicle programs in addition to cash received upon the sale of vehicles primarily under repurchase and guaranteed depreciation agreements see note to our consolidated financial statements 
d primarily represents commitments under service contracts for information technology and telecommunications 
the above table does not include future cash payments related to interest expense or any potential amount of future payments that we may be required to make under standard guarantees and indemnifications that we have entered into in the ordinary course of business 
for more information regarding guarantees and indemnifications  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
accounting policies critical accounting policies in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events and or events that are outside of our control 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results 
however  our businesses operate in environments where we are paid a fee for a service performed  and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective  nor complex 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
we have reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in performing this review  we are required to make an assessment of fair value for our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause the fair value to be less than the respective carrying amount 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge  which would impact earnings 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
the aggregate carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets was approximately billion and million  respectively  at december  our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are allocated among three reporting units 
accordingly  it is difficult to quantify the impact of an adverse change in financial results and related cash flows  as such change may be isolated to one of our reporting units or spread across our entire organization 
in either case  the magnitude of any impairment to goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets resulting from adverse changes cannot be estimated 
however  our businesses are concentrated in one industry and  as a result  an adverse change in the vehicle rental industry will impact our consolidated results and may result in impairment of our goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets 
table of contents to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized 
in performing this review  we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
a change in these assumptions could cause an increase or decrease to our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate  which could materially impact our results of operations 
additionally  our income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities 
we establish reserves for tax treatments when  despite our belief that the treatments are fully supportable  certain treatments are likely to be challenged and where we may not succeed in defending our position 
we adjust our reserves upon the closing of a tax audit  which in some cases can occur several years following the related transaction or the filing of the tax return under examination  or upon the occurrence of other changes in facts and circumstances that indicate an adjustment may be necessary including subsequent rulings and interpretations by tax authorities or court decisions on similar matters 
changes to the reserves related to matters for which we are not indemnified by realogy and wyndham could materially impact our results of operations 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding income taxes 
financial instruments 
we estimate fair values for each of our financial instruments  including derivative instruments 
most of these financial instruments are not publicly traded on an organized exchange 
in the absence of quoted market prices  we must develop an estimate of fair value using dealer quotes  present value cash flow models  option pricing models or other conventional valuation methods  as appropriate 
the use of these fair value techniques involves significant judgments and assumptions  including estimates of future interest rate levels based on interest rate yield curves  volatility factors  and an estimation of the timing of future cash flows 
the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts recorded in the financial statements  which are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  hedge accounting requires that at the beginning of each hedge period  we justify an expectation that the relationship between the changes in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges compared to changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged items will be highly effective 
this effectiveness assessment  which is performed at least quarterly  involves an estimation of changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates  as well as the probability of the occurrence of transactions for cash flow hedges 
the use of different assumptions and changing market conditions may impact the results of the effectiveness assessment and ultimately the timing of when changes in derivative fair values and the underlying hedged items are recorded in earnings 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of the effect of hypothetical changes to these assumptions 
public liability  property damage and other insurance liabilities  net 
insurance liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets include additional liability insurance  personal effects protection insurance  public liability  property damage and personal accident insurance claims for which we are self insured 
we estimate the required liability of such claims on an undiscounted basis utilizing an actuarial method that is based upon various assumptions which include  but are not limited to  our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors 
the required liability is also subject to adjustment in the future based upon changes in claims experience  including changes in the number of incidents frequency and changes in the ultimate cost per incident severity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use various financial instruments  particularly swap contracts  futures and options contracts to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related specifically to our debt 
foreign currency forwards are also used to manage and reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated receivables and forecasted royalties  forecasted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and other transactions 
we also use derivative commodity instruments to manage and reduce the risk of changing unleaded gasoline prices 
we are exclusively an end user of these instruments  which are commonly referred to as derivatives 
we do not engage in trading  market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
more detailed information about these financial instruments is provided in note financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements 
our principal market exposures are interest  foreign currency rate and commodity risks 
our primary interest rate exposure at december  was to interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically libor and commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we anticipate that libor and commercial paper rates will remain a primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we have foreign currency rate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations worldwide and particularly with respect to the british pound  canadian dollar  australian dollar and the new zealand dollar 
we anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we have commodity price exposure related to fluctuations in the price of unleaded gasoline 
we anticipate that such commodity risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact in earnings  fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates 
we use a duration based model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts on our debt portfolio and interest rate derivative portfolios 
the primary assumption used in this model is that a increase or decrease in the benchmark interest rate produces a parallel shift in the yield curve across all maturities 
our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented 
while probably the most meaningful analysis  these shock tests are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 

table of contents we used december   and market rates on outstanding financial instruments to perform the sensitivity analyses separately for each of our market risk exposures 
the estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates 
we have determined that the impact of a change in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and prices on our earnings  fair values and cash flows would not be material 
while these results may be used as benchmarks  they should not be viewed as forecasts
