ltd  and its affiliate  premier bpo  inc  a variable interest entity and its wholly owned chinese subsidiary  premier bpo tianjin co  ltd 
en pointe technologies and the building blocks design are registered trademarks of the company and are mentioned or referred to in this annual report 
item business general en pointe technologies  inc was originally incorporated in texas on january  and reincorporated in delaware on february  and serves as a holding company and a provider of administrative services to its subsidiaries 
we are a national provider of information technology products hardware and software and value added services with a customer base consisting primarily of large and medium sized companies and government entities 
we use proprietary and non proprietary software and systems to drop ship information technology products to our customers through an electronically linked network of suppliers that include distributors and certain manufacturers in the united states 
this software allows us to serve as an electronic clearinghouse of computers and computer related products without many of the risks and costs associated with maintaining significant inventory 
in addition to seeking efficiencies and growth in our traditional large enterprise focused core business  we continue to devote resources to the development of our managed and professional services infrastructure 
en pointe is represented in approximately sales and service markets throughout the united states 
in addition  we maintain a value added integration center that we recently moved to in october in rancho cucamonga  california that is iso certified 
we provide our customers with cost effective electronic commerce tools that help them to maximize their purchasing power when searching for and acquiring computer equipment and other technology products 
one of our available tools  accesspointe tm  is a uniquely powerful and flexible internet procurement system that is electronically linked to the extensive warehousing  purchasing and distribution functions of our suppliers 
accesspointe tm provides ease of use  real time accuracy  and the power to control the purchasing process  from paperless requisition creation to line item detail delivery tracking 
the direct links to our suppliers enhance our capacity to provide our customers with automated direct access to an extensive range of products at competitive prices 
business model our business model covers hardware and software fulfillment and value added services 
hardware fulfillment extends beyond efficient delivery to include pre deployment services that we perform prior to shipment  including imaging and image management  configurations  asset tagging  inventory management and master packing 
the procurement process is vital to hardware fulfillment and we try to make this process as efficient as possible for our customers 
value added services include ongoing managed services such as management of information technology infrastructure as well as professional services that provide specific information technology solutions for our customers 
software fulfillment includes presales consulting  monitoring license compliance and managing software publishers relationships 
the hardware fulfillment business relies on our virtual inventory model that has been developed and enhanced over time  but since our inception in  our core concepts have remained the same 
the virtual inventory model s essential elements are i a low cost overhead structure resulting from the automation of many management and operating functions  ii effective electronic information systems  and iii reduced working capital requirements due to the limited amount of physical inventory that we hold and our allied distributor relationships 
our sophisticated and customized enterprise resource planning system  referred to as sap  allows us to monitor sales  product returns  inventories  profitability and accounts receivable at the sales representative and customer level 
additionally  we have integrated product purchasing and customer invoicing into our information systems to expedite procurement and billing 
accesspointe tm  an ebusiness platform  provides us and our customers with up to date product information and streamlines the procurement process 
the completely integrated ebusiness information technology architecture helps us maintain effective online communication links with our sales representatives  selected suppliers  and many of our customers 
accesspointe tm is provided free of charge to our customers to better enable them to execute transactions and research their orders online with us 
we continue to focus on cost control and strive to maintain a low cost overhead structure through the automation of many of our management and operating functions 
in fiscal  we introduced another low cost overhead element to our business model by relocating many of our back office functions to a service provider in islamabad  pakistan 
effective october   we continued our cost control focus by acquiring a ownership interest of that service provider in pakistan  ovex technologies private limited  or ovex 
the day to day customer support function is shared between a centralized staff at headquarters  back office contract workers in pakistan  and local account management 
this helps us improve field response yet maintains direct access to all back office functions and senior management 
increased local coverage has fueled efforts to identify new opportunities 
we believe that time in front of customers is the top priority for all account managers  account executives  and senior management to build long lasting relationships and identify business solutions for existing and new customers 
our product sales are conducted principally from both traditional branch offices as well as from virtual offices which are located in approximately metropolitan markets in states 
our service business is offered nationally and is managed and staffed by our in house technicians using  when necessary  limited engagements of contracted third party service providers 
we believe in seeking out new markets wherever there is a business case to support the incurring of additional personnel expense or whenever specific account opportunities arise 
we have been and continue to be  since may   certified as a minority controlled company by the national minority supplier development council 
the certification is considered valuable because many large buying organizations  private enterprise accounts and state and local government agencies have supplier diversity initiatives that may require certain purchases to be made from certified minority controlled companies 
an integral component of our business model is our ability to access an extensive inventory of information technology products stocked by our suppliers through our integrated supply chain information systems that are key features of accesspointe tm 
additionally  the intelligent purchasing feature of our software allows our purchasing department to place multiple line item orders automatically from multiple sources at the lowest possible price  maximizing the fill rate and increasing the potential profitability on each order 
the data provided by our customized information system allows our sales representatives to design each customer s orders according to their particular needs 
product can be delivered directly from suppliers to the customer or processed through our configuration facility located in rancho cucamonga  california 
we simplify the ordering  staging  and delivery process through supply chain management for any size order 
our configuration facility is located close to our major suppliers warehouse locations for convenient same day pick up of orders 
this provides the configuration facility with the flexibility to meet stringent service level agreements and still function economically by limiting inventory to customer ordered product 
once our configuration facility tests and loads systems with predefined customer images  systems are then shipped ready to install  saving customers money in downstream deployment costs 
just in time configuration is well supported by our information system that identifies which of our suppliers can supply the desired product at the best price when needed from different products offered from multiple suppliers 
a distinct advantage of our business model is the economy achieved by the conservation of working capital through leveraging our virtual inventory model that engages the extensive warehousing  purchasing  distribution  marketing and information technology functions of our suppliers 
since inception  we have been an innovator in using the drop shipping capabilities of our suppliers whenever product configuration is not required 
drop shipping avoids the costs and risks associated with maintaining inventory  enabling us to quickly adapt our product offerings to changing market demands 
as product proliferation has occurred  we believe that our limited inventory position has given us a competitive advantage with respect to price and availability on a broad range of products 
we do  however  still maintain and stage inventory for our customers  as necessary  whenever it s economical and fulfills a business purpose 
we believe our business model allows us to have the capacity to increase sales with minimal additional capital investment 
our value added services business  by offering certain essential and highly individualized services  principally the optimization and management of customer s information technology infrastructure  caters to multi year service contracts  which constitutes the majority of our service business 
our service agreements are designed exclusively for the windows intel cisco operating environment  which is the dominant industry platform 
our services include life cycle management which encompasses hardware configuration  customer customization  deployment  install move add change  maintenance  asset management and help desk 
our customer base is broad and encompasses both large national accounts as well as small to medium businesses and governmental agencies 
various service fee arrangements are available from which customers are supported by certified technical engineers that are trained on each customer s specific requirements 
the fee arrangements range from fixed price in which our personnel may be shared to cost plus for dedicated on site personnel  or a combination of both  depending on the customer s needs 
we also offer an array of value added professional services that include needs assessment  design solutions  deployment and post deployment support  and help desk for our customers 
in addition  we provide at our iso certified integration facility configuration services  including hardware configuration  software installation and custom imaging services  testing  aggregation  and asset tagging 
whether customers buy their products from us or others  we can provide them with extensive logistics support 
in support of that growing part of our business  during the later half of fiscal  we completed the development of the logistics management system  or lms  software program 
the lms program is integrated with sap and allows us to more efficiently work with our customers and common carriers 
the lms program s single system environment has the capability to manage and track logistic activities  providing customers with detailed asset reporting as well as asset life cycle management 
the lms program has the following benefits overall customer project planning  detailed planning and scheduling of customer assets to be serviced  receipt confirmation of customer assets and subsequent tracking ability  periodic detailed customer asset reporting by serial number  and management of customer life cycle process to include reconditioning and packaging  redeployment  and liquidation  identification of leased assets and compliance with lease terms  and work order history by serial number of each customer asset 
the software licensing business employs highly skilled personnel to provide comprehensive solutions to customers needing software solutions 
this specialized group provides value to customers in their presales consulting  monitoring license compliance and managing software publishers relationships 
although we have been for several years an authorized microsoft large account reseller as well as an authorized agent for many other software publishers  we had not fully developed the operational and system capabilities to expand sales opportunities 
in early fiscal year  recognizing that need  we began the process of enhancing the capabilities of sap and accesspointe tm to improve upon presales consulting  monitoring license compliance and managing software publishers relationships 
upon completion of the software upgrades in june  we now believe that we have a more efficient software selling process that has produced and will continue to produce noticed improvements for our customers ordering and maintenance needs 
the program provides the following benefits maintains software agreements for all major software publishers  incorporates a dynamic data model that simplifies reporting processes to allow improved identification of customer trends  sales opportunities  and customer milestones  provides real time product configuration that reduces time for sales representatives to identify customer requested software products  restricts the data entry to a structured format that ensures adherence to vendor and publisher rules  thereby avoiding the costly retroactive correction of errors in processing  manages software agreements to offer customers the ability to purchase software more efficiently by increasing their awareness of software agreement terms  purchasing history  and needs  identifies software products for compliance with customer software agreements  allows stricter service level agreements to be met by reducing turnaround time for quotes and orders  and manages licensing agreements assuring customers are quoted and sold products in accordance with their existing agreements 
ebusiness we offer competitive advantages for our customers through use of modern information technologies  and inventive business processes 
by use of our virtual inventories and online procurement and service solutions we leverage technology to enable our business model 
we begin by employing enterprise resource planning  or erp  technology via an sap based system that maintains our operational and financial processes within a structure that provides for flexibility with full executive control and accountability 
this system forms the core of our organization and maintains control over every transaction whether with vendors or customers 
reporting  decision making support  inventory control  and logistic management are some of the key functions of our erp system that have been customized to offer a broad range of services including  order processing from our virtual inventory  customized configuration orders  customer logistic and disposal management  software license management as well as back office accounting for our professional services 
to make business transactions with us easy and intuitive  we have created our online internet based application accesspointe dedicated toward advancing our e business by using solutions that provide for integration with each customer s applications and unique procurement processes 
accesspointe provides customers with a complete life cycle procurement solution that helps put customers in control of their organization s spending practices and standardizes their information technology selections 
accesspointe does this by providing customer based approval workflow as well as allowing customers to encourage or enforce ordering for certain products over others 
accesspointe provides the capability for customers to have highly customized views of our product catalog by restricting products they don t want to order 
with accesspointe  customers can do real time searches for all products available from en pointe s vendors or  in the case of software inquiries  customers can confine their searches to those software products that apply to their specific software license contracts 
transaction history is also available from accesspointe in customizable reports that can be programmed to generate whenever desired 
accesspointe provides confidence that our customers transactions will be secure and private  and can integrate with other information technology online marketplaces 
our professional and managed service teams employ tools that allow customers to monitor the progress of our service engagements  and to have service dispatch and reports available to other customer systems to ensure the services we provide are coordinated with all other customer processes and departments 
these tools can provide online status of open or scheduled service work  report outstanding items  integrate with customer systems  and allow our customers to partner with us 
in addition to our main systems  we have ancillary systems that automate our internal processing of transactions 
these tools and application solutions allow us to create custom information technology product and service catalogs for our customers and also provide capabilities to integrate with customer order and payment processes within our distributor network 
these solutions are flexible enough to allow us to not only manage content from any number of vendors but to also be able to provide data management services daily to select customers and support custom order integration with customers with complex and unique ordering needs 
managed and professional services we provide a full range of information technology life cycle services  including the following needs assessment  solution design  image development  configuration  deployment and implementation  install move add change  system refresh and disposal services  post deployment support and training  help desk  maintenance  and asset management we employ best practices to provide high quality  low cost service solutions that address client information technology infrastructure needs  from the desktop to the wide area network 
we do our own technical recruiting for these positions  to better control the quality of our staff and to provide timely and cost competitive alternatives suitable for the varying skill and or geographic requirements of our customers 
a team dedicated to sales of services complements the larger general sales staff to uncover opportunities within existing accounts and to seek new business 
for the three fiscal years ended in  net sales from services provided  and  respectively  of our total net sales 
seven large customers accounted for approximately of our total service revenues for the fiscal year as compared to approximately and for the respective and fiscal years 
we have historically focused more on our managed services business than our professional services opportunities because managed services usually involve multi year desktop and server support contracts for specified periods of time 
these engagements typically result in relatively consistent revenue streams that enable us to make strategic long term investments to expand our service offerings and organizational infrastructure 
professional services  on the other hand  tend to require higher levels of investment without the relative predictability of managed services engagements 
nonetheless  they play a critical role in providing engineering services and skilled resources necessary to fully support the requirements and expectations of a managed service program 
our enterprise help desk services are offered either on site at the customer location or through our centralized call center 
we maintain a technically trained staff that resolves problems during the initial phone call  thereby decreasing customer down time and increasing end user productivity 
this also reduces the need to dispatch technicians for on site visits  which reduces the overall costs of customer support 
included in our professional service offerings are desktop and server design  messaging  storage  wireless  broadband and other network support  and security 
with system security being of such concern  we require our engineers and consultants to become security certified 
we plan that service engagements offered by us will include a security focus that will differentiate our professional services offerings from those of our competitors 
while we have not invested significantly in this area relative to our managed services  customer demand for these services appears to be increasing and we will respond to opportunities when we can leverage our existing infrastructure or when it complements an existing customer support agreement 
one area in which we continue to expand is in offerings to customers of return on investment consulting 
we assist customers to maximize the return on their information technology investment dollars by moving to new hardware platforms  consolidating servers and storage  and efficiently managing human resources with our expertise in active directory  a microsoft program that allows organizations to manage information about network resources and users 
we also have helped customers implement technologies that allow them to fix end users computers remotely  without having to dispatch an onsite engineer  and compute for our customers the savings they realize by minimizing their down time 
we use clarify  an industry leading customer relationship management system  to create and track our service calls and to manage service parts 
this system measures and reports initial response times  on site arrival times  and call closure or resolution times 
from voluminous call ticket data  this system compiles and calculates the corresponding service levels so that we can be measured against industry standards  our company objectives  and customer commitments 
this enables us to improve our processes to achieve greater levels of customer satisfaction 
products the majority of our sales are information technology products 
we currently make available to our customers an extensive selection of products at what we believe to be a competitive combination of price and availability 
we currently offer over  information technology products from hundreds of manufacturers  including  without limitation  international business machines corporation  or ibm  hewlett packard company  or hp  dell computer corporation  or dell  lenovo  cisco systems  inc  fujitsu limited  apple inc  com corporation  microsoft corporation  or microsoft  toshiba corporation  kingston technology corporation  lexmark international  inc  sony corporation  symantec corporation  mcafee  inc  bea systems  inc  avaya  inc and altiris  inc 
we are also one of a limited number of microsoft certified large account resellers 
we have different levels of certifications on many of these product lines 
products that we offer include desktop and laptop computers  servers  monitors  memory  peripherals and accessories  operating systems  application software  consumables and supplies 
in fiscal  products manufactured by hp accounted for approximately of our product sales in terms of revenue compared with and for the two consecutive prior fiscal years 
business process outsourcing effective october   we acquired of the capital stock of two privately owned pakistani companies  ovex technologies private limited and ovex pakistan private limited 
ovex technologies private limited was engaged in providing business process outsourcing  or bpo  services exclusively for the company s internal needs as well as for the customers of pbpo while ovex pakistan private limited provided services for the bpo market in pakistan 
subsequently  on july   the two companies were approved for merger by the pakistan court effective october  the surviving company in the merger was ovex technologies private limited  or ovex 
ovex employs approximately people 
since  ovex has provided us with bpo services for our selling and marketing operations 
commencing with the quarter ended june   ovex has also assumed the responsibilities for our accounting and finance outsourcing 
with the addition of ovex to our portfolio  we have continued to recognize the growth opportunities present in bpo services and have committed to its future as a viable segment of our business model 
ovex complements our existing investment in premier bpo  inc  or pbpo  a privately held corporation that promotes and sells bpo services to us businesses 
pbpo also has a wholly owned chinese subsidiary  premier bpo tianjin co  ltd  or pbpochina  that it formed in fiscal that provides bpo services in china similar to the services provided by ovex in pakistan 
ovex has an ongoing business relationship with pbpo by virtue of having been the principal provider of bpo services to pbpo s us customers 
in addition  the approximate owners of ovex collectively own of the outstanding shares of common stock of pbpo  as well as of the outstanding shares of series a non voting convertible preferred stock of pbpo and have a representative on its board of directors 
we  in turn  own of the outstanding voting shares of pbpo s common stock  of the outstanding shares of pbpo s series a non voting convertible preferred stock  have a representative on pbpo s board of directors and consolidate pbpo in our financial reports as a variable interest entity  or vie  in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
pbpo shares workspace with ovex in islamabad for a nominal fee using contracted ovex workers and  effective september  entered into a five year cost plus fixed fee service agreement with ovex to supply contracted employees and an operating facility in lahore  pakistan 
in addition  pbpo has agreed to provide certain marketing services for ovex 
the agreements can be terminated with thirty days written notice by pbpo 
competition we operate in the highly competitive sales segment of the information technology industry  and compete with a large number and variety of types of resellers of information technology products and services 
our competition also includes hardware and software manufacturers and national computer retailers that market directly to end users 
many of these companies compete principally on the basis of price and may have lower costs than us  allowing them to offer the same products and services for less 
others have developed highly specialized practices focusing on specific segments such as security  storage  server consolidation  voice over internet protocol  etc 
many of our competitors are of equal size or smaller and sell to regional markets  or are larger  and sell nationally with substantially greater financial  technical  and marketing resources available to them 
some of our larger competitors are moredirect  inc  compucom  inc  technology integration group  pomeroy it solutions  inc  cdw corporation  pc mall  inc  zones  inc 
and insight enterprises  inc a few of these organizations stock inventory and take advantage of opportunistic seasonal buys which often affords them a pricing advantage 
on the services side  we compete with several large service providers  some of whom provide products and services and others who only provide services 
those that provide services only include banctec  inc  barrister global services network 
and halifax corporation 
we also partner with service only providers in several areas including dispatch  install  move  add and change support services 
dell and gateway  inc  or gateway  initially launched the manufacturer direct model and were successful in gaining market share 
other manufacturers eg ibm and hp have adopted a direct model to actively market products directly to customers 
sometimes this is done through an agent referral program by which independent sales agents receive commissions directly from manufacturers 
this has had the effect of reducing the role of distributors and resellers  particularly in the enterprise accounts  which is a large percentage of our traditional target market 
in order to compensate for this potential loss of business  some distributors are now also adopting sales agent programs as an alternative means of directly securing product orders to end user customers 
the direct business model can infringe on some value added resellers  such as us  by taking a slice of those sales that can be resolved through a single vendor solution 
our business model emphasizes comprehensive solution offerings with services wrapped around hardware and software products  attracting mainly enterprise organizations  government and to a lesser extent  mid market customers 
with the sales channel continuing to consolidate  absorbing those companies that combine face to face direct selling with web based models  we believe that our business model will succeed  as it embraces both comprehensive and web based types of selling methods  allowing us to cater to various customer preferences 
we believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our ebusiness systems  services flexibility  and the scalability of our operations to meet our customers needs as well as providing a single point of contact for hardware  software  and services 
getting product to the customer the distribution of information technology products requires considerable investment in inventory  production control systems  and the development and maintenance of distribution channels 
resellers who assume these functions incur capital costs associated with the warehousing of products  including the costs of leasing warehouse space  maintaining inventory and tracking systems  and employing personnel to perform all the associated tasks 
furthermore  resellers who stock inventory risk obsolescence costs  which we believe may be significant due to the rapid product innovation that characterizes this market 
these overhead and touch costs require expenses that we believe more than offset the lower price advantages offered for purchasing at volume discounts and holding for future sale 
our business model eliminates many overhead and touch costs and substantial risks by leveraging the operational strengths of our suppliers  who have developed extensive warehousing  purchasing and distribution functions 
as a result  our continuing strategy is to limit our product inventory and the associated capital costs  allowing us to accept lower gross profit margins than many of our competitors 
by relying on the processing strengths of our suppliers  we are able to concentrate on developing our information systems and focus on more customer oriented activities including researching  specifying  and delivering solutions 
after helping a customer select the most appropriate technology  our sales staff use our information systems to determine the best combination of price and availability for a wide variety of information technology products 
our ability to fill and deliver orders with a high level of speed and accuracy is a key benefit of our business model 
our sophisticated systems  which include all order processing functions  enable us to review  approve  and electronically transmit orders to the proper supplier s within minutes of receiving them from customers 
most orders for in stock product are picked  staged  and drop shipped directly to the customer from the suppliers within hours of receipt of an order  and on the same business day for orders received by pm pacific time 
we usually electronically obtain order delivery information the day following shipment from our major suppliers 
we then use that information to produce an invoice  which is often sent to the customer electronically 
the standard delivery  based on product availability  is within two to three business days 
custom configuration usually adds a few more business days to the shipping time 
getting product from the supplier our staff has the ability to access the current inventory and availability records of our suppliers  so we can quickly determine which supplier can best fill an order at a given price 
furthermore  if any one supplier is unable to fill all of a customer s requirements  we are generally able to split the order among multiple sources 
this increases the same day fill rate  reduces back orders  and shrinks the time to complete an order 
our suppliers maintain warehouses throughout the country  and their individual stocking levels are updated and readily available through our systems 
this allows our staff to determine where the product is available for shipment  better gauging the delivery time to the customer s door 
we and our suppliers utilize various carriers  including industry giants united parcel service  inc and federal express corporation  to deliver product 
again taking advantage of a vendor s particular expertise  we integrate the carriers tracking system facility into our own systems to closely monitor shipments and provide delivery status for our customers 
this provides an audit trail for the customer to update order status  by tying the customer purchase order to an en pointe invoice and a subsequent proof of delivery 
we purchase most of our products from major distributors such as synnex corporation synnex  tech data corporation tech data  and ingram micro inc ingram micro  and directly from large manufacturers such as ibm  hp including the former compaq  dell and microsoft 
these are suppliers who have the requisite system strengths and integration capabilities that enable our automated systems to function efficiently 
we have successfully implemented our business strategy due in large part to these system synergies and to our close relationships with our suppliers 
equally significant to the success of our supplier relationships has been the volume of business we generate  as this volume has allowed us to negotiate more favorable terms with our suppliers 
see item a 
risk factors we risk depending on a few distributors and manufacturers who could compete with us or limit our access to their product line 
intellectual property our ability to effectively compete in our market will depend significantly on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we do not have patents on any of our technology  which we believe to be material to our future success 
we rely primarily on trade secrets  proprietary knowledge and confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our rights in intellectual property  and to maintain our competitive position 
there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop similar or superior intellectual property  gain access to our trade secrets or knowledge  or that any confidentiality agreements between us and our employees will provide meaningful protection for us in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary information 
supplyaccess  inc  a former affiliate of ours  was liquidated in february  and as a result of that liquidation  we acquired the full rights to accesspointe tm as well as the intellectual property rights to all of supplyaccess  inc s software  copyrights  trade secrets and other proprietary technology 
we conduct our business under the trademark and service mark en pointe technologies as well as our logo  accesspointe tm and other marks 
we have been issued registrations for our en pointe technologies and building blocks marks in the united states 
we do not believe that our operations are dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks 
we also sell products and provide services under various trademarks  service marks  and trade names that are the properties of others 
these owners have reserved all rights with respect to their respective trademarks  service marks  and trade names 
segment information the provisions of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  require public companies to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments 
we identify reportable segments based on how management internally evaluates separate financial information  business activities and management responsibility 
for the year ended september   we operated in three segments  us sales of products and services  pakistan business process services  and china business process services 
see our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for disclosures of the amounts reported for the different segments 
en pointe technologies  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries combined with pbpo operate in the us sales of products and services segment  while ovex operates in the pakistan business process services segment and pbpochina operates in the china business process services segment 
in the two prior fiscal years  and  before we had acquired ovex and before pbpochina commenced operations we reported in only one segment 
employees as of september   en pointe technologies  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries employed approximately individuals including approximately sales  marketing and related support personnel  service and support personnel  warehousing  manufacturing  and logistic personnel  information technology personnel and employees in administration and finance 
we believe that our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled technical and other management personnel will be critical to our ability to execute our business model and growth strategy 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
in addition to our us employees  we have foreign employees working for ovex in pakistan that provide us with back office support  provide our affiliate  pbpo  with customer bpo services support  and provide bpo services to a customer in pakistan 
as of september   ovex employed approximately people in support of us and pbpo covering customer support  sales  telemarketing  purchasing  operations  help desk  accounting  and information technology functions 
as of september   pbpo and pbpochina collectively employed a total of people

risk factors this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities exchange act of and section e of the securities exchange act of in light of the important factors that can materially affect results  including but not limited to those set forth in this paragraph and below  the inclusion of forward looking information herein should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives or plans will be achieved  we may encounter competitive  technological  financial  economic and business challenges making it more difficult than expected to continue to sell our products and services  we may be unable to retain existing key sales  technical and management personnel  there may be other material adverse changes in the information technology industry or the economy  or in our operations or business  and any or all of these factors may affect our ability to continue our current sales rate or may result in lower sales volume than currently experienced 
certain important factors affecting the forward looking statements made herein include  but are not limited to stagnate sales growth in the last five years  limited availability of alternative credit facilities  low margin products business  and concentration of product and service sales in several major customers 
assumptions relating to budgeting  marketing  and other management decisions are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments  the impact of which may cause us to alter our marketing  capital expenditure or other budgets  which may in turn affect our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the reader is therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements contained herein  which speak as of the date of this annual report on form k 
we do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to update any forward looking statements or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any statements to reflect new information or future events or developments 
the reader should carefully consider the following risks 
in addition  keep in mind that the risks described below are not the only risks faced 
the risks described below are only the risks that we currently believe are material to our business 
however  additional risks not presently known  or risks that are currently believed to be immaterial  may also impair business operations 
there is a risk we could lose our asset based financing line without being able to readily replace it our business requires significant capital to finance accounts receivable and  to a lesser extent  product inventories 
in order to obtain necessary working capital  we rely primarily on a line of credit that is collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
as a result  the amount of credit available to us may be adversely affected by numerous factors beyond our control  such as delays in collection or deterioration in the quality of our accounts receivable  economic trends in the information technology industry  reduction in interest free flooring periods provided by various manufacturers and the lending policies of our creditors 
any decrease or material limitation on the amount of capital available to us under our line of credit and other financing arrangements  particularly our interest free flooring  may limit our ability to fill existing sales orders or expand our sales levels and  therefore  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we are dependent on the availability of accounts receivable financing on reasonable terms and at levels that are high relative to our equity base in order to maintain and increase our sales 
our financing agreement contains various liquidity debt covenants that must be met each quarter 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet those debt covenants and failure to do so would place us under default and could cause us to lose our financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing will continue to be available to us in the future on acceptable terms  as there are a very limited number of asset based lenders that service our industry 
our inability to have continuous access to such financing at reasonable costs could materially adversely impact our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
there is risk that we could lose a large customer without being able to find a ready replacement for fiscal years  and  no one customer accounted for or more of our total net sales 
however  our sales do tend to be concentrated in a relatively few accounts with our top five customers in fiscal years  and accounting for an aggregate of  and  respectively  of total net sales and our top twenty five customers representing an aggregate of  and  respectively  of total net sales 
for fiscal years  and  no one customer accounted for or more of our total product or service sales  however  seven large customers accounted for an aggregate of  and  respectively  of total service sales 
our contracts for the provision of products or services are generally non exclusive agreements that are terminable by either party upon days notice 
either the loss of any large customer  or the failure of any large customer to pay its accounts receivable on a timely basis  or a material reduction in the amount of purchases made by any large customer could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our acquisition of a substantial interest in a pakistani corporation exposes us to foreign operational risks with our acquisition of a majority interest in ovex  a pakistani corporation  we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  limitations on asset transfers  changes in foreign regulations and political turmoil  any or all of which could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  we have relocated many of our back office functions to ovex including  among others  customer support  purchasing  credit and collections  accounts payable  accounting and other administrative and support functions 
we established both voice and data communications between our corporate headquarters in el segundo  california and pakistan 
however  there can be no assurance that these lines of communication will not be interrupted 
should we have interruptions with our communications to pakistan  any such interruption could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our low margins expose us to risks from minor adversities our overall gross profit percentages for the past three fiscal years  and were   and  respectively  with gross margin from product sales in such fiscal years being  and  respectively 
our gross profit margins on product and software sales are low compared to many other resellers of information technology products and have continued to remain low 
given the significant levels of competition that characterize the reseller market  as well as the lower gross profit margins that we generate as a result of our reliance on purchasing information technology products from our suppliers  it is unlikely that we will be able to increase product gross profit margins appreciably in our core business of reselling information technology products 
moreover  in order to attract and retain many of our larger customers  we frequently must agree to pricing and maximum allowable mark downs that serve to limit the profitability of product sales to such customers 
accordingly  to the extent that our sales to such customers increase  our gross profit margins may be reduced  and therefore any future increases in net income will have to be derived from net sales growth  effective expansion into higher margin business segments or a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales  none of which can be assured 
furthermore  low gross profit margins increase the sensitivity of our business to increases in costs of financing  because financing costs to carry a receivable can be relatively high compared to the low dollar amount of gross profit on the sale underlying the receivable itself 
low gross profit margins also increase the sensitivity of the business to any increase in product returns and bad debt write offs  as the impact resulting from the inability to collect the full amount for products sold will be relatively high compared to the low amount of gross profit on the sale of such product 
any failure by us to maintain our gross profit margins and sales levels could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
costs and other factors associated with pending or future litigation could materially harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we at times receive claims and become subject to litigation  including claims related to customers  stockholders  acquisitions  employment  intellectual property  trade secrets and other commercial litigation related to the conduct of our business 
additionally  we may at times institute legal proceedings against third parties to protect our interests 
any litigation in which we are a named party could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
in connection with any such litigation  we may be subject to significant damages or equitable remedies relating to the operation of our business 
we cannot determine with any certainty the costs or outcome of pending or future litigation 
any such litigation may materially harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
there are risks in conducting our daily business plans and strategy for our first five full fiscal years since inception  we experienced rapid growth in net sales  employees and branch offices leading to peak net sales of million in fiscal year from a base of million in fiscal year since fiscal year we have experienced a contraction in net sales reaching a low in net sales of million in fiscal year  or a compounded annual decline rate of for the three year period 
since  we have seen a gradual increase in net sales to the million reached in fiscal year  which is a compounded annual growth rate of over such five year period 
the effort to increase net sales or to supplement the loss of net sales with higher margin products or services has and will continue to challenge our management  operational and financial resources 
to execute our growth strategy  we expect to require the addition of new management personnel  including sales and technical services personnel  and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel 
our ability to manage effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and sales systems at both the national and local level  to develop the skills of our managers and supervisors and to hire  train  motivate  retain and effectively manage our employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such an effort  and the failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
with our fast changing industry evolution we risk being outmoded or excluded from the distribution channel the personal computer industry is undergoing significant change 
in addition  a number of alternative cost effective channels of distribution have developed in the industry  such as the internet  computer superstores  consumer electronic and office supply superstores  national direct marketers and mass merchants 
computer resellers are consolidating operations and acquiring or merging with other resellers and or direct marketers to achieve economies of scale and increased efficiency 
the current industry reconfiguration and the trend towards consolidation could cause the industry to become even more competitive  further increase pricing pressures and make it more difficult for us to maintain our operating margins or to increase or maintain the same level of net sales or gross profit 
declining prices  resulting in part from technological changes  may require us to sell a greater number of products to achieve the same level of net sales and gross profit 
such a trend could make it more difficult for us to continue to increase our net sales and earnings growth 
in addition  growth in the personal computer market has slowed 
if the growth rate of the personal computer market were to further decrease  our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 
the segment of the information technology industry in which we operate is highly competitive 
we compete with a large number and wide variety of resellers and providers of information technology products and services  including traditional personal computer retailers  computer superstores  consumer electronics and office supply superstores  mass merchandisers  corporate resellers  value added resellers  specialty retailers  distributors  franchisers  mail order and web order companies  national computer retailers  service only providers  and manufacturers that have their own direct marketing operations to end users 
many of these companies compete principally on the basis of price and may have lower costs than us  which allow them to offer the same products and services at lower prices 
many of our competitors are larger  have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources and offer a broader range of value added services than we do 
we compete with  among others  compucom systems  inc  dell  gateway  pomeroy it solutions  inc  cdw corporation  ibm  hp  insight enterprises  inc  pc mall  inc  gtsi corp  zones  inc  pc connection  inc  and certain distributors 
we expect to face additional competition from new market entrants in the future 
competitive factors include price  service and support  the variety of products and value added services offered  and marketing and sales capabilities 
while we believe that we compete successfully with respect to most  if not all of these factors  there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future 
the information technology industry has come to be characterized by aggressive price cutting and we expect pricing pressures will continue in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the information technology products industry is characterized by abrupt changes in technology and associated inventory and product obsolescence  rapid changes in consumer preferences  short product life cycles and evolving industry standards 
we will need to continue to provide competitive prices  superior product selection and quick delivery response time in addition to developing a core competency in performing value added services in order to remain competitive 
if we were to fail to compete favorably with respect to any of these factors  our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected 
see business competition 
we risk depending on a few distributors and manufacturers who could compete with us or limit our access to their product line a key element of our past success and future business strategy involves the maintaining of alliances with certain key suppliers of information technology products and services  including  tech data  microsoft  ingram micro  synnex  and dell 
these alliances enable us to make available to our customers a wide selection of products without subjecting us to many of the costs and risks associated with maintaining large amounts of inventory 
products and services purchased from those five suppliers  in fiscal years  and accounted for  and of our aggregate purchases 
furthermore  we compete with certain suppliers for many of the same customers 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any such allied distributor will not use its position as a key supplier to pressure us from directly competing with them 
substantially all of our contracts with our suppliers are terminable by either party upon days notice or less and several contain minimum purchase volume requirements as a condition to providing discounts to us 
the termination or interruption of our relationships with any of the suppliers  modification of the terms or discontinuance of agreements with any of the suppliers  failure to meet minimum purchase volume requirements  or the failure to maintain a good working relationship with any significant new distributor of information technology products could materially adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see business getting product to the customer 
certain of the products we offer are subject to manufacturer allocations  which limit the number of units of such products available to the suppliers  which in turn may limit the number of units available to us for resale to our customers 
because of these limitations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to offer popular new products or product enhancements to our customers in sufficient quantity or in a timely manner to meet demand 
in order to offer the products of most manufacturers  we are required to obtain authorizations from such manufacturers to act as a reseller of such products  which authorizations may be terminated at the discretion of the suppliers 
as well  certain manufacturers provide us with substantial incentives in the form of allowances  training  financing  rebates  discounts  credits and cooperative advertising  which incentives directly affect our operating income 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive such incentives and authorizations in the future and any reduction in these incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
there can also be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain authorizations to offer products  directly or indirectly  from new or existing manufacturers 
termination of our rights to act as a reseller of the products of one or more significant manufacturers or our failure to gain sufficient access to such new products or product enhancements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
evolution of the distribution process in the information technology industry has put pressure on gross profit margins  and has adversely affected a number of distributors of information technology products  including certain suppliers 
there can be no assurance that the continuing evolution of the information technology industry will not further adversely affect our distributors 
because our overall business strategy depends on our relationships with our suppliers  our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be materially adversely affected in the event that distributors in general and suppliers in particular continue to suffer adverse consequences due to ongoing changes in the information technology industry 
there has been a consolidation trend in the information technology industry  including consolidation among distributors of information technology products 
because our business model is dependent upon the availability of a number of information technology product distributors  any further consolidation would result in fewer distributors available to supply products to us  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we have the risk of losing our senior management and other key personnel upon whom we depend we believe that our success has been and will continue to be dependent on the services and efforts of our existing senior management and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of any of our existing senior management and other key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our success and plans for future growth also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel in all areas of our business  including application development  sales and technical services 
competition for qualified personnel in the information technology industry is intense  and although we believe that we have thus far been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel for our business  the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we risk failure to integrate acquisitions and or investments into our business that could cause future losses one element of our growth strategy may include continuing to expand our business through strategic acquisitions and investments in complementary businesses 
to date  we have made several such acquisitions and investments 
however  we do not have significant acquisition or investment experience  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates in the future  complete acquisitions or investments  or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our operations 
acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks  including but not limited to failure to achieve anticipated operating results  difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  products  vendor agreements  and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention and other resources from other business concerns  entry into markets in which we have little or no prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees  customers  or contracts of the acquired company 
acquisitions and investments could also conflict with restrictions in our agreements with existing or future lenders  distributors or manufacturers 
we are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition or investment candidate will become available or the likelihood that any acquisition or investment will be completed or successfully integrated 
failure to successfully manage potential acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  or failure of any of our investments that are subject to consolidation  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we risk business interruption from our dependence on centralized operations we believe that our success to date has been  and future results of operations will be  dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to our customers 
as a result  a substantial disruption of our day to day operations could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  our success is largely dependent on the accuracy  quality and utilization of the information generated by our information systems  which are primarily based in el segundo and rancho cucamonga  california 
repairs  replacement  relocation or a substantial interruption in these systems or in our telephone or data communications systems  servers or power could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
although we have business interruption insurance  an uninsurable loss could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our current use of a single configuration facility in rancho cucamonga  california also makes us more vulnerable to dramatic changes in freight rates than a competitor with multiple  geographically dispersed sites 
losses in excess of insurance coverage  an uninsurable loss  or change in freight rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
with the concentration of ownership of our stock held by a small group of directors  officers  family members and an outside principal stockholder there are risks that they can exert significant influence over corporate matters the directors  executive officers  family members and a significant outside stockholder of en pointe and their affiliates beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock as of september  as a result  these stockholders acting together will be able to exert considerable influence over the election of our directors and the outcome of most corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
additionally  the directors and executive officers have significant influence over the policies and operations of our management and the conduct of our business 
such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of en pointe and consequently could affect the market price of our common stock 
there are risks that our quarterly operating results can vary from past results and become volatile and unpredictable our quarterly net sales and operating results may vary significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the demand for information technology products and value added services  adoption of internet commerce models  introduction of new hardware and software technologies  introduction of new value added services by us and our competitors  changes in manufacturers prices or price protection policies  changes in shipping rates  disruption of warehousing or shipping channels  changes in the level of operating expenses  including costs from turnover of sales personnel  the timing of major marketing or other service projects  product supply shortages  inventory adjustments  changes in product mix  entry into new geographic markets  the timing and integration of acquisitions or investments  difficulty in managing margins  the loss of significant customer contracts  the necessity to write off a significant amount of accounts receivable or inventory  and general competitive and economic conditions 
in addition  a substantial portion of our net sales in each quarter results from orders booked in such quarter 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
as has occurred in the past it is possible that in future periods  our operating results may be below the expectations of the public and investors 
in such event  the market price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our stock tends to be volatile with large percentage price moves which can expose investors to unanticipated losses factors such as the announcement of acquisitions by us or our competitors  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  governmental regulatory action  general trends and market conditions in the information technology industry  as well as other factors  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
moreover  trading volumes in our common stock has been low historically and could exacerbate price fluctuations in the common stock 
further  the stock market has recently and in other periods experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of the equity securities of many companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
see market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
if our internal controls prove to be ineffective that could negatively impact investors confidence in our company and cause our stock price to drop changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations implemented by the securities and exchange commission  or sec  and the nasdaq stock market  or the nasdaq  are creating uncertainty for public companies  increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming 
we are undergoing an evaluation of our internal controls systems to allow management to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  our internal controls 
we are also in the process of performing the system and process evaluation and testing and any necessary remediation required to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
as a result  we expect to incur substantial additional expenses and diversion of management s time 
while we anticipate being able to fully implement the requirements relating to internal controls and all other aspects of section by the extended september  deadline  we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation  testing and remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations since there is presently no precedent available by which to measure compliance adequacy 
if we are not able to implement the requirements of section in a timely manner or with adequate compliance  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud and might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the sec or the nasdaq 
any such action could harm our business or investors confidence in our company  and could cause our stock price to fall 
if preferred stock is issued as an anti takeover measure  there is a risk that the price of our common stock could be adversely affected our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  qualifications  limitations and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
further  section of the general corporation law of delaware prohibits us from engaging in certain business combinations with interested stockholders 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of en pointe without action by our stockholders  and therefore could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
there are risks outside of our control of unfavorable economic conditions that could negatively impact our revenues and profits revenue growth depends on the overall demand for information technology spending 
while economy in the united states appears to be stable  there can be no assurance that stability will continue 
any downturn in the united states economy may result in cutbacks by customers in the purchase of information technology products and services  postponed or canceled orders  longer sales cycles and lower average selling prices 
to the extent that a downturn occurs  we believe demand for our products and services  and therefore future revenues  could be further adversely impacted

executive overview we began operations in march of as a reseller of information technology products 
in fiscal year  value added services were added to our customer offerings 
value added services represented  and of our net sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the gross profit margins on the value added services that we currently offer are significantly higher than the gross profit margins on our information technology product business  but require additional overhead expense for supervision  idle time  and other expenses related to service offerings that offset a portion of the increased margin 
in october  we made an initial investment in pbpo  a start up company in tennessee that sells bpo services that carry higher gross profit margins  similar to those found in our value added services 
then  in october we broadened our bpo capability by acquiring a interest in ovex  a private company in pakistan that had significant experience and success in providing bpo services for our internal operations as well as for pbpo s customers 
in our initial operating years from fiscal to fiscal  with the aid of a robust economy and an information technology market that accommodated our business model  our net sales increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 
seasonal trends were never prominent in our business  although march quarters were historically regarded as one of the least promising quarters 
in fiscal we experienced our first annual net sales decline of  or million  from net sales in fiscal due to a softer information technology market and difficulties in transitioning to a new enterprise resource planning business system 
net sales continued to decline in subsequent fiscal years reaching a low of million in fiscal year  or a compounded annual decline rate of for the three years 
the last five years have seen a compounded annual growth rate of in net sales from million in fiscal year to the present million in fiscal year net sales increased million  or  and gross profits increased million  or  in fiscal year from fiscal year  driven principally by increased product sales 
operating expenses  consisting mainly of selling and marketing expenses  increased a total of million over fiscal year results  leaving operating income of million in fiscal year  an improvement of million over the million reported in fiscal year because our business model involves the resale of information technology products held in inventory by certain distributors  we do not maintain significant amounts of inventory on hand for resale 
we typically do not place an order for product purchases from distributors until we have received a customer purchase order 
inventory is then drop shipped by the distributor to either the customer or shipped to our configuration center in rancho cucamonga  california 
the distributor typically ships products within hours following receipt of a purchase order and  consequently  substantially all of our product net sales in any quarter result from orders received in that quarter 
although we maintain a relatively small amount of inventory in stock for resale  most of our inventory represents either merchandise being configured for customers orders or products purchased from distributors and shipped  but not yet received and accepted by our customers 
product revenues are generally recognized upon delivery to the customer 
service revenues are recognized based on contractual hourly rates as services are rendered or upon completion of specified contract services 
net sales consist of product and service revenues  less discounts 
cost of sales includes product and service costs and current and estimated allowances for returns of products that are not accepted by our distributors or manufacturers  less any incentive credits 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations require us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we regularly discuss with our audit committee the basis of our estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware  software  peripherals  and service and support contracts 
we apply the provisions of the sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab no 
outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies 
in general  we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the sales price charged is fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 
under our standard shipping terms  title passes upon delivery to a common carrier but revenue is not recognized until delivery takes place which is generally two to three days later 
product is therefore considered received and accepted by the customer only upon the customer s receipt of the product from the carrier 
any undelivered product is included in our inventory 
the majority of our sales relate to physical products and are recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as net sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales 
however  software maintenance contracts  software agency fees  and extended warranties that we sell in which we are not the primary obligor  are recorded on a net basis in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition and emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
such net revenues are recognized in full at the time of sale 
we have adopted the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions sop in recognizing revenue from software transactions 
revenue from software license sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has been made  and a fixed fee and collectibility has been determined 
service revenues are recognized based on contracted hourly rates  as services are rendered or upon completion of specified contracted services and acceptance by the customer 
revenue from customer maintenance support agreements  in which we are not the primary obligor  is reported on a net basis and recognized at the time of the sale 
net sales consist of product and service revenues  less discounts and estimated allowances for sales returns 
cost of sales include the cost of product and services sold and current and estimated allowances for product returns that will not be accepted by our suppliers  less rebates 
deferred revenues result from prepaid management services and maintenance contracts 
many of our management services are pre billed quarterly and income is recognized as services are performed 
our maintenance contracts are generally for services that may be performed over a one year period of time 
income is recognized on such contracts ratably over the period of the contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables by two methods 
first  we evaluate specific accounts over days outstanding and apply various levels of risk analysis to these accounts to determine a satisfactory risk category to which given percentages are applied to establish a reserve 
second  a general reserve is established for all other accounts  exclusive of the accounts identified for the specific reserve  in which a percentage is applied that is supportable by historic collection patterns 
product returns 
we provide an allowance for sales returns  which is based on historical experience 
in general  we follow a strict policy of duplicating the terms of our vendor or manufacturers product return policies 
however  in certain cases we must deviate from this policy in order to satisfy the requirements of certain sales contracts and or to satisfy or maintain customer relations 
to establish a reserve for returns  outstanding return merchandise authorizations  or rmas  are reviewed 
those rmas issued for which the related product has not been returned by the customer are considered future sale reversals and are fully reserved 
in addition  an estimate  based on historical return patterns  is provided for probable future rmas that relate to past sales 
generally  customers return goods to our configuration facility in rancho cucamonga  california  where they are processed to return to the vendor 
vendor returns 
after product has been returned to vendors under authenticated rmas  we review such outstanding receivables from our vendors and establish a reserve on product that will not qualify for refund based on a review of specific vendor receivables 
rebates and cooperative marketing incentives 
we receive incentives from suppliers related to product and volume rebates and cooperative marketing development funds 
these incentives are generally under monthly  quarterly  or annual agreements with the suppliers  however  some of these incentives are product driven or are provided to support specific programs established by the supplier 
suppliers generally require that we use their cooperative marketing development funds exclusively for advertising or other marketing programs 
as marketing expenses are recognized  these restricted cooperative marketing development funds are recorded as a reduction of the related marketing expense with any excess funding that can not be identified with a specific vendor program reducing cost of goods sold 
as rebates are earned  we record the rebate receivables with a corresponding reduction of cost of goods sold 
any amounts received from suppliers related to cooperative marketing development funds are deferred until earned 
incentive programs are subject to audit as to whether the requirements of the incentives were actually met 
we establish reserves to cover any collectibility risks including subsequent supplier audits 
inventory 
although we employ a virtual inventory model that generally limits our exposure to inventory losses  with certain large customers we contractually obligate ourselves to product availability terms that require maintaining physical inventory  as well as configured product 
such inventory is generally confined to a very limited range of product that applies to specific customers or contracts 
included in our inventory is product that has been returned by customers but is not acceptable as returnable by the vendor 
as a result  we expose ourselves to losses from such inventory that requires reserves for losses to be established 
we record varying reserves based upon the class of inventory ie held for resale or returned from customers and age of inventory 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended september  net sales product services total net sales gross profit product services total gross profit selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses operating income loss interest income  net other income  net income loss before taxes and minority interest income tax benefit income loss before minority interest minority interest net income loss comparison of fiscal years ended september  and net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year our affiliate  pbpo  and subsidiary  ovex  contributed million and million  respectively  of the total net sales increase with the remaining million increase coming from our core operations of sales and service of information technology products 
while no one customer accounted for or more of total net sales in fiscal years or  the core operation increase in sales resulted  in fact  from large volume customers who purchased increased amounts of our products and services 
for example  net sales to our top five customers accounted for of total net sales in fiscal year net sales to these top five customers increased million  or  in fiscal year over the total net sales to these same five customers in the prior fiscal year 
product net sales in fiscal year increased million  or  over fiscal year and were responsible for most of the increase in the total net sales for the year 
top selling products were software  desktop computers and laptops  respectively  for both fiscal years and with software sales being the leading component of the sales mix 
software agency commissions  a part of product sales  increased for the third consecutive year in fiscal year  to million  an increase of million  or over fiscal commissions 
service net sales in fiscal year increased a marginal million  or over fiscal year service net sales from our affiliate  pbpo  and our subsidiary  ovex  that promotes and performs business process outsourcing services  increased million to an aggregate of million for fiscal year and were responsible for all of the increase in our service net sales for fiscal year core service net sales in fiscal year  which relate to the service of information technology products and exclude the contributions of pbpo and ovex  decreased million to million from million in fiscal year the decline in core service net sales in fiscal year was in large part from the conclusion of a substantial municipal services work project that was principally completed in fiscal year as well as from a decrease of services to a major customer that has been adversely affected by the general slow down in the mortgage industry 
gross profit 
gross profits increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million for fiscal year the bulk of the increase in gross profits  million  was from product gross profits  with the remainder million attributable to services 
our affiliate  pbpo  and subsidiary  ovex  contributed approximately one third of the gross profits increase  or million  on aggregate base sales of million for fiscal year overall gross margins improved to in fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
product gross profits increased million in fiscal year to million from million in the prior fiscal year principally from increased sales volume 
product gross margin percentages improved marginally to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the slight improvement in margins was attributable to the increase in agency commission fees that bear no associated costs 
excluding the agency commissions  product gross margins fell to in fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
service gross profits increased million in fiscal year to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
most of the increase  million  was attributable to an increase in service gross profits from our affiliate  pbpo  which operates on an approximate service gross margin 
our core service gross profits  which relates to the service of information technology products and excludes the contributions of pbpo and ovex  increased marginally million in fiscal year to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
related core service gross margins increased to from 
while core service net sales were down  core service gross profits and margins were up 
most of the service gross margin improvement can be traced to a major municipal service project that was largely completed in fiscal year and whose revenues of million and service gross margins of adversely impacted fiscal results causing a drop in overall gross margins for that year 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year the million increase in selling and marketing expenses in fiscal year was attributable principally to a million increase in wages from the hiring of an additional employees  including for the call center in the us and for the recently formed cabling division  and million in increased overtime pay 
the remaining increase in selling and marketing expenses relates to increases in expenses for our affiliate  pbpo  and subsidiary  ovex 
selling and marketing expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales  were flat at for fiscal years and general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  or g a  increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from in fiscal year all of the increase was attributed to our affiliate  pbpo  and subsidiary  ovex  with g a expense for pbpo and ovex increasing million and million respectively 
the ovex increase was due to our acquisition of ovex stock and ovex s merger in fiscal year with no comparable expense in prior fiscal years 
the majority of the increase for pbpo relates to increases in salary as well as increases in travel and entertainment related costs 
as with selling and marketing expenses  when g a expenses are expressed as a percentage of net sales  the results are flat at for fiscal years and operating income 
operating income increased million in fiscal year to million as compared with million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase of million in operating income can be attributed to the increase in gross profit of million less the million increase in operating expenses during fiscal year as discussed above 
interest income  net 
interest income is net of interest expense and consisted of the following components for the last two fiscal years in thousands year ended september  interest income interest expense net interest income net interest income increased million in fiscal year to million from million in fiscal year interest income in both fiscal years resulted from our short term cash investments 
interest expense increased million in fiscal year to million from million in fiscal year the increase was principally from the acquisition of ovex in fiscal year and the related interest expense that was not present in the prior fiscal year 
the ovex interest expense includes million related to short term borrowings under an export finance program 
in addition  consolidated interest expense includes approximately million related to capitalized leases 
the interest expense in fiscal years and from our lending facility with ge commercial distribution finance corporation was approximately  and  respectively  which is customarily low due to our interest free borrowing periods allowed under the financing 
other income 
other income increased a marginal  in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year but was not a significant factor for either fiscal year 
income tax benefit provision 
a  tax benefit was provided for fiscal year  which arose principally from a  decrease to our valuation allowance for deferred tax benefits related to net operating loss tax benefits 
the decrease of  represented our estimate of the federal and state taxes at a combined rate of that would be incurred in future periods and for which the tax benefit of the deferred net operating loss deduction would be available 
only  of the  decrease was available for the reduction of deferred taxes since the balance   relates to net operating losses arising from stock options and are considered an adjustment of equity 
as a result of the use of the deferred net operating loss of  future provisions for taxes  for financial statement purposes  will not benefit from the net operating loss deduction and will be computed at the full statutory rates 
we file a consolidated federal income tax return  while for many of our state tax returns we file separately under the name of our wholly owned sales subsidiary  en pointe technologies sales  inc  that is qualified to do business in all fifty states 
our consolidated return excludes both pbpo and ovex because in the case of pbpo  our investment is less than the required to consolidate under federal tax law 
in the case of ovex  we are not taxed on foreign income until it is distributed 
as of september  we had million of federal nol carry forwards  which at federal tax rates would reduce future federal taxes by million 
in addition  there are million of alternative minimum tax credits carry forwards that bring the total future benefit to million  of which million was recognized in fiscal year the nol carry forwards are scheduled to expire at various dates through fiscal year section of the internal revenue code could limit the future use of some or all of the nol carry forwards if the ownership of our common stock changes by more than percentage points in certain circumstances over a three year testing period 
minority interest 
under fin and other recent changes in consolidation principles  certain minority interests are required to be consolidated 
we own an approximate voting interest in pbpo and under fin are required to consolidate pbpo s financial results in our financial statements 
as a result  we allocate certain losses to the other stockholders of pbpo who collectively own approximately of pbpo 
losses so allocated to the minority interest are not based upon the percentage of ownership  but upon the at risk capital of those owners 
once the minority interest at risk capital has been absorbed by losses  all remaining losses are allocated to us  without regard for the amount of capital that we hold at risk 
ovex  on the other hand  was acquired in fiscal year and we own a majority interest in that company 
thus  we allocate of the net income of ovex to its minority shareholders 
the allocations to the minority interest in thousands for the last two fiscal years was as follows year ended september  ovex profit pbpo loss profit loss allocations net income 
net income increased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the principal reasons for the million increase in net income was from the million increase in operating income and the million decrease in income taxes 
comparison of fiscal years ended september  and net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year moderating the net sales decrease was the business of software medium  inc  that we acquired in january and that contributed million in net sales for fiscal year and pbpo  our variable interest entity affiliate  whose sales increased million 
no one customer accounted for or more of total net sales in fiscal year or however  sales do tend to be concentrated in a relatively few accounts as evidenced in fiscal years and when our top five customers made up and  respectively  of total net sales and our top twenty five customers contributed and  respectively  of total net sales 
on a quarterly seasonal basis  our june quarter  helped by software agency commissions of million  was the strongest net sales quarter of the fiscal year for the third consecutive year with the june fiscal quarter coming in at million compared with million in prior fiscal year period 
on the other hand  the march quarter of fiscal continued to be the weakest net sales quarter of the fiscal year for the third consecutive year 
product sales in fiscal year decreased million  or  to million from million reported in fiscal year  reflecting a decline in overall net sales from a few of our major customers 
service revenues in fiscal year decreased year over year million  a lesser decline than reported in product sales  but at a higher rate of  to million from the million reported in the prior fiscal year 
gross profit 
gross profits increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million for fiscal year services contributed million of the gross profits increase  with products responsible for remaining million 
with declining net sales  the increase in gross profits came solely from improvements in gross margin percentages which improved for both product and services to a combined from in fiscal year product gross margin percentages improved by to in fiscal year while service improved by to 
most of the million increase in product gross profits came from agency commission fees of million which in turn originated primarily from increased microsoft software commission fees 
the service gross profits increase of million was from a combination of factors  however 
pbpo  our consolidated affiliate  contributed million of the increase in service gross profits for fiscal year over fiscal year two large logistic and asset management customers contributed the majority of the remaining million increase in service gross profits 
these were high volume projects in which processing costs were successfully contained 
other factors explaining the increase include the reaching of certain contractual milestones with our municipal service contracts that allowed us to recognize higher service margins as well as our acquisition in january of a security services business that traditionally earns above average gross profit margins 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year the million increase is inclusive of a decrease in pbpo s selling and marketing expenses of million 
excluding the decrease in pbpo s selling and marketing expense  our core selling and marketing expenses increased by million 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses in fiscal year resulted primarily from million of wage related expenses consisting of million in commissions  mainly from increased software sales and draws  million in wages  and million in employee benefits and reimbursements 
we also experienced a million increase in our business process outsourcing expenses from increased use of employees offshore and from costs related to software programming in india 
however  those costs were largely offset by million from increased co op funds and from a favorable settlement of disputed balances with creditors 
when selling and marketing expenses are expressed as a percentage of net sales  there was an increase of to in fiscal year from in fiscal year general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  or g a  increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in g a was principally the result of higher legal expenses of million due to the three legal suits that we defended and to million in the settlement of the first union securities matter dating back to when g a expenses are expressed as a percentage of net sales  there was an increase of to in fiscal year from in fiscal year operating income loss 
operating income of million was realized in fiscal year compared with million of operating loss in the prior fiscal year 
the increase of million in operating income can be attributed to the increase in gross profit of million less the million increase in operating expenses during fiscal year as discussed above 
interest income expense  net 
interest income of million in fiscal year is net of interest expense of million 
interest income resulted from our short term cash investments while most of interest expense in fiscal year was related to capitalized leases for computer equipment acquired 
the interest expense in fiscal year from our lending facility with ge commercial distribution finance corporation was approximately  which is customarily low or non existent due to our interest free borrowing periods allowed under the financing 
net interest income increased million in fiscal year compared with the prior fiscal year 
most of the increase can be attributed to the inclusion in fiscal year of million of interest expense related to the ontario configuration facility that was not present in the fiscal year due to the ontario lease converting from a financing lease to an operating lease in which rentexpense replaces interest expense as a major expense item 
other income 
other income decreased million in fiscal year from that of fiscal year the decrease in other income was due to the inclusion in fiscal year of insurance recovery from prior year losses and rental income which did not repeat in fiscal year provision for income taxes 
we provided a  tax provision for fiscal year  an increase of  from that provided in the prior fiscal year 
while we are not subject to the regular corporate federal income tax rates because of the tax benefit derived from our past net operating losses  or nols  that can be carried forward  we are nevertheless subject to the federal alternative minimum tax 
the alternative minimum tax limits nol carryforwards that can be applied in any one year to of the current year s taxable income and imposes a tax on the remaining of taxable income 
we file a consolidated federal income tax return  while for many of our state tax returns we file separately under the name of our wholly owned sales subsidiary  en pointe technologies sales  inc  that is qualified to do business in all fifty states 
our consolidated return excludes pbpo because our investment is less than the required to consolidate under federal tax law 
thus  none of the losses generated by pbpo are available for the reduction of income taxes 
as of september  we had million of nol carry forwards for which a valuation allowance has been provided 
the nol carry forwards are scheduled to expire at various dates through fiscal year section of the internal revenue code could limit the future use of some or all of the nol carry forwards if the ownership of our common stock changes by more than percentage points in certain circumstances over a three year testing period 
of the million nol carry forwards  million will be considered an adjustment to additional paid in capital and will not benefit future earnings  since those losses were attributable to the exercise of employee stock options  which had been recognized as expense for tax purposes but not for financial statement purposes 
minority interest 
under fin and other recent changes in consolidation principles  certain minority interests are required to be consolidated 
we own an approximate voting interest in pbpo and under fin are required to consolidate pbpo s financial results in our financial statements 
as a result  we allocate certain losses to the other stockholders of pbpo who collectively own approximately of pbpo 
losses so allocated to the minority interest are not based upon the percentage of ownership  but upon the at risk capital of those owners 
once the minority interest at risk capital has been absorbed by losses  all remaining losses are allocated to us  without regard for the amount of capital that we hold at risk 
net income 
net income increased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the principal reason for the million increase in net income was from the million increase in operating income less million of reductions in non operating income  principally other income and income from recognizing the minority interest in our affiliate s loss 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  and amounts available under our ge financing facility 
these sources have been adequate for day to day operations and for capital expenditures 
although we can not provide any assurance  we believe that our remaining cash balances  cash flows from operations  and availability of funds under our financing facility will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements for the next fiscal year 
cash flows from operating activities during fiscal  our operating activities used cash totaling million as compared with million that was provided by operating activities in the prior fiscal year 
the lead contributors to the million net decrease in cash from operating activities were increases in inventory and accounts receivable that together increased million from fiscal year our accounts receivable balance  net of allowances for returns and doubtful accounts  at september  and  was million and million  respectively  an increase of million in fiscal year the accounts receivable increase was principally from a million sale made to the us government a few days prior to the end of fiscal year the million sale was also responsible for the increase in the number of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable to days from days  as of september  and  respectively 
inventory  net of allowance  increased million in fiscal year to million from the million reported at the end of the prior fiscal year 
the majority of the increase resulted from increases in physical inventory purchased for specific customer orders and to a lesser extent to an increase in inventory in transit at fiscal year end 
cash flows from investing activities investing activities used cash totaling million for fiscal year  an increase of million from the prior fiscal year 
the million increase resulted from increased acquisition costs of million  increased purchases of property and equipment of million  and a million short term cash investment 
cash flows from financing activities financing activities provided net cash totaling million in fiscal  million more than the million of net cash that was used in fiscal most of the million increase in cash provided in fiscal was from an increase of million in net borrowings under our line of credit 
in addition  our subsidiary  ovex borrowed million under a government sponsored export finance borrowing program that carries annual interest rates of 
credit facility as of september   we had approximately million in cash and working capital of million 
our two primary information technology sales subsidiaries  en pointe technologies sales  inc and en pointe gov  inc  and ge commercial distribution finance corporation ge are parties to that certain business financing agreement and that certain agreement for wholesale financing dated june   as amended to date collectively  the agreements 
we are the guarantor of the obligations under the agreements 
under the flooring arrangement  the two subsidiaries may purchase and finance information technology products from ge approved vendors on terms that depend upon certain variable factors 
the two subsidiaries may borrow up to of their collective eligible accounts receivable at an interest rate of prime plus per annum  subject to a minimum rate of 
such purchases from ge approved vendors have historically been on terms that allow interest free flooring 
the original agreements provided for a million accounts receivable and flooring facility and expired on june   but were extended on june  to july  via a temporary overline letter agreement 
effective july   the facility was increased to million and certain financial covenants were revised pursuant to an addendum executed among the parties 
the addendum also provided an extension of the term of the facility for a period of three years from august  and for successive one year renewal periods thereafter  subject to termination at the end of any such period on at least sixty days prior written notice by any party to the other parties 
effective september   we entered into an amendment to delete all prior financial covenants contained in the agreements and to restate them effective for the last day of each calendar quarter as follows as such terms are defined in the agreements tangible net worth and subordinated debt in the combined amount of not less than  total funded indebtedness to ebitda for the preceding four fiscal quarters then ended  shall be no more than 
we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september the ge facility is collateralized by accounts receivable  inventory and substantially all of our other assets 
as of september   approximately million in borrowings were outstanding under the million financing facility 
at september   there were additional borrowings available of approximately million after taking into consideration the borrowing limitations under the agreements  as amended to date 
recent accounting pronouncements accounting pronouncements adopted in september  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
we adopted sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal year sab requires registrants to use both a balance sheet approach and an income statement approach when quantifying and evaluating the materiality of a misstatement and to adjust the financial statements if either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material 
in adopting the requirements of sab  we determined that previously accrued taxes that were overstated by million and immaterial to the balance sheet  could be considered material to the income statement  if adjusted 
the accrued tax overstatement resulted from an under accrual of an income tax refund in years prior to  which had been evaluated as being immaterial under the reversing rollover method at that time 
we reported the cumulative effect of the initial application of sab by adjusting accumulated deficit as of september  with a credit of million 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas  accounting for servicing of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
this standard clarifies when to separately account for servicing rights  requires servicing rights to be separately recognized initially at fair value  and provides the option of subsequently accounting for servicing rights at either fair value or under the amortization method 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after september  but can be adopted early as long as financial statements for the fiscal year in which early adoption is elected  including interim statements  have not yet been issued 
we adopted this accounting pronouncement effective october  and the adoption has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fas  accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and this statement permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that would otherwise have to be accounted for separately 
the new statement also requires companies to identify interests in securitized financial assets that are freestanding derivatives or contain embedded derivatives that would have to be accounted for separately  clarifies which interest and principal only strips are subject to statement no 
 and amends statement no 
to revise the conditions of a qualifying special purpose entity due to the new requirement to identify whether interests in securitized financial assets are freestanding derivatives or contain embedded derivates 
this statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september  we adopted this accounting pronouncement effective october  and the adoption has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting pronouncements pending adoption in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which is effective for the company in fiscal years beginning july  this statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates 
subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued fas  fair value measurements 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin no 

this interpretation requires recognition and measurement of uncertain income tax positions using a more likely than not approach 
the provisions of fin no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of item a of regulation s k 
obligations and commitments as of september   we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments  contracts  contractual obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period in thousands less than contractual cash obligations total year years years after years capital leases operating leases lines of credit impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had or will have a material effect on our net sales or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
seeking to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
the average duration of all of our investments in fiscal year was less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair market value of our interest sensitive financial investments 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our investment income  while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest expense 
historically  and as of september   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
we presently have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates from borrowings under our line of credit with ge 
while ge s lending agreements provide for interest at over prime per annum with a minimum rate of  effectively with the interest free flooring that has been made available  we incur little or no interest expense 
therefore  a hypothetical increase in the interest rate from the levels as of september  would not have a material impact on our financial position  consolidated results of operations or cash flows 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk and exchange rate differences to the extent of our investment in ovex in pakistan since such operations incur local operating costs and generate third party revenues in currencies other than the us dollar 
to date we have not entered into any hedging transactions or market sensitive instruments to attempt to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
however  we may decide in the future to implement an active hedging program utilizing derivative instruments to assist in managing our foreign currency exchange risk 
based on our overall foreign exchange rate exposure at september   a change in the rupee would not have a material effect on our financial position  consolidated results of operations or cash flows 
we are also committed to certain off balance sheet obligations represented by operating leases for office facilities and various types of office equipment which are fully disclosed in the financial statement footnotes 
we have no commercial paper  derivatives  swaps  hedges  joint ventures and or partnerships  or currency fluctuation to disclose and evaluate for market risks
