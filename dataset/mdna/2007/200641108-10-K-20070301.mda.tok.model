in evaluating the cumulative information in the following table  it should be noted that each year s amount includes the cumulative effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods 
this table does not present accident or policy year development data 
conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on the following table

we held reserves in the amount of  for lead paint related claims at december  our reserves for environmental claims such as oil spills and mold were  and  respectively  at december  these reserves have been established to cover claims for known losses 
because of our limited exposure to these types of claims  we believe they will not have a material impact on our financial position 
operating ratios loss and underwriting expense ratios 
loss and underwriting expense ratios are used to interpret the underwriting experience of property and casualty insurance companies on a statutory basis 
certain corporate expenses included in our loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs do not impact the statutory loss and lae ratio or the statutory underwriting ratio because they are not expenses borne by our insurance subsidiaries 
examples include a portion of book value awards bva and incentive awards ia expense  employee stock ownership plan esop expense and directors compensation 
underwriting profit margins are reflected by the extent to which the sum of the loss and underwriting expense ratios  which we refer to as the combined ratio  is less than 
the combined ratio is considered the best simple index of current underwriting performance of an insurer 
the ratios which follow include lines of insurance other than automobile 
data for the property and casualty industry generally may not be directly comparable to our data

investments investment income is an important source of revenue for us  and the return on our investment portfolio has a material effect on our net earnings 
our investment strategy emphasizes investment yield while maintaining investment quality 
the focus of our investment objectives continues to be maximizing after tax investment income through investing in high quality diversified investments structured to maximize after tax investment income while minimizing risk 
a secondary objective is to achieve above average after tax total return 
our funds are generally invested in securities with maturities intended to provide adequate funds to pay claims and meet other operating needs without the forced sale of investments

regulation our business is subject to extensive regulation 
in massachusetts  the commissioner of insurance is appointed by the governor and has broad authority 
the commissioner sets maximum policy rates and establishes minimum agent commission levels on personal automobile insurance 
in addition  the commissioner grants and revokes licenses to write insurance  approves policy forms  sets reserve requirements  determines the form and content of statutory financial statements and establishes the type and character of portfolio investments 
the commissioner also approves company submissions regarding affinity group insurance programs and corresponding discounts along with permitted deviations  such as safe driver deviations 
consequently  the policies and regulations set by the commissioner are an important element of writing insurance in massachusetts 
in states other than massachusetts  premium rates generally must be filed with  and approved or not disapproved by th e commissioner of insurance in that particular state 
in general  minimum commissions to agents are not set by the other state commissioners 
state insurance regulators are responsible for conducting periodic examinations of insurance companies 
massachusetts division of insurance regulations provide that insurance companies will be examined every five years or more frequently as deemed prudent by the commissioner 
california department of insurance regulations provide that insurance companies will be examined every three years 
ohio department of insurance regulations provide that insurance companies will be examined at least every five years 
both commerce and citation were examined for the five year period ended december  commerce west was last examined in by the california department of insurance for the four year period ended december  american commerce was examined in by the ohio department of insurance for the five year period ended december  these examinations produced no material findings 
at the state level  various forms of automobile insurance reform are continuously debated 
in massachusetts  for example  new regulations and legislation are often proposed with the goal of reducing the need for premium increases or to alter car results sharing 
see massachusetts automobile business section of item  business  and commonwealth automobile reinsurers section of item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further discussion 
although the us federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry  federal initiatives often have an impact on the industry 
proposed legislation currently exists in congress  the state modernization and regulatory transparency smart act  which would force states to comply with uniform standards and resolve disputes  speed up the process of getting new products to the market and move toward a system of market based rates 
congress and certain federal agencies continue to investigate the current condition of the insurance industry  encompassing both life and health and property and casualty insurance  in the united states in order to decide whether some form of federal role in the regulation of insurance companies would be appropriate 
congress conducts hearings relating  in general  to the solvency of insurers and has proposed federal legislation from time to time on this and other subjects 
former new york attorney general eliot spitzer and his staff had been challenging two separate but related insurance industry practices fraudulent bid fixing and certain contingent commission payments 
mr 
spitzer and his staff took legal action against several companies as a result of these challenges 
no such action has been taken against us or any of our subsidiaries by any regulator in regards to these practices  nor do we expect any such action to occur 
automobile insurance regulation overview 
massachusetts has required compulsory automobile insurance coverage since states other than massachusetts generally have varying levels of minimum compulsory insurance 
under current law  all massachusetts motorists are required to carry certain minimum coverages mandated by the state 
with very limited exceptions  each servicing carrier writing private passenger automobile insurance in massachusetts must accept all risks submitted to the servicing carrier for the compulsory coverage  but is permitted to reinsure these risks including affinity group marketing insurance risks through car 
compulsory coverage 
compulsory coverage includes no fault coverage  limited bodily injury coverage  property damage coverage and coverage against uninsured or hit and run motorists 
the massachusetts no fault statute provides for personal injury protection coverage  which entitles a party to be reimbursed directly by the party s own insurer for certain medical expenses  lost wages and other defined expenses arising from an automobile accident  up to a specific amount  even if another party caused the accident 
rates and commissions 
massachusetts personal automobile insurance rates are fixed and generally established annually by the commissioner 
affinity group marketing insurance programs and permitted deviations must be annually approved by the commissioner 
we set our voluntary massachusetts commercial automobile insurance rates competitively  subject to the commissioner s authority to disapprove such rates 
car files the rate for commercial automobile risks reinsured through car  subject to the authority of the commissioner to disapprove the rates  except for ceded private passenger type non fleet business which is filed by insurance companies and approved by the commissioner 
for additional information  see commonwealth automobile reinsurers 
massachusetts personal automobile premiums charged to a policyholder are adjusted based upon the safe driver rating of the operator 
moving violations and at fault accidents affect each driver s safe driver rating 
in addition  the extra risk rating regulations permit insurers to deny coverage or charge surcharged rates for physical damage coverage to both high risk vehicles and insureds with excessive prior loss or violation activity 
the commissioner sets an average minimum direct agency commission rate for personal automobile insurance 
with respect to risks reinsured through car  the maximum amount of commissions that car will reimburse the ceding carrier  as part of their expense allowance structure  is fixed at that prescribed rate 
rates and commissions in states other than massachusetts are set competitively on a company by company and state by state basis 
mandatory underwriting 
with minimal exception  massachusetts law specifies that all individuals holding a valid driver s license be entitled to purchase the mandatory automobile insurance coverages regardless of their driving experience or accident record 
massachusetts law also places certain restraints on insurers discretion to refuse to renew automobile insurance policies 
policyholders are generally entitled to renew except in cases of fraud  material misrepresentation  revocation or suspension of an operator s license or nonpayment of premiums 
with very limited exceptions  servicing carriers that participate in car in massachusetts must accept every automobile risk submitted to them 
under the massachusetts system of rate regulation  some personal automobile insurance risks are purposefully under priced by the commissioner  and therefore  absent state intervention  insurers would not ordinarily choose to write those risks 
the car reinsurance program described below is intended to mitigate the burden imposed by under pricing and the massachusetts take all comers system  by allowing insurers to transfer the exposure for under priced risks to an industry pool  and by granting participation credits for voluntary writing of certain under priced risks 
while credits are required by statute  the detailed credit offer is annually established by car and approved by the commissioner 
commonwealth automobile reinsurers 
car is a massachusetts state mandated reinsurance mechanism  under which all premiums  expenses and losses on ceded business are pooled and shared by all insurers 
it is similar to a joint underwriting association because a limited number of insurers participate in the program as servicing carriers 
at december   there were a total of companies  including commerce  that were servicing carriers for the personal automobile pool 
at december   six insurers  including commerce  were limited servicing carriers for the commercial automobile market 
see the previous discussion of car s new commercial program in the massachusetts automobile business section 
in general  agencies licensed to issue automobile insurance policies are entitled to be assigned to at least one servicing carrier 
there are two categories of private passenger agencies those that have voluntary agreements with one or more servicing carriers  and those that do not 
the latter are assigned by car  generally to a single servicing carrier and are known as private passenger erps 
an agent can be an erp for private passenger automobile or commercial automobile or both 
an insurer may terminate its participation in car by surrendering its license to write automobile policies in massachusetts 
termination does not discharge or otherwise affect liability of an insurer incurred prior to termination 
a withdrawing insurer is assessed a share of car s projected results for future years based on the insurer s prior years participation in car 
the assessment paid by the withdrawing insurer is redistributed to the remaining insurers based on their participation ratios 
an insurer can transfer its obligations for its personal insurance policies to another insurer who formally agrees to assume these obligations 
the transferring insurer is thereby relieved of future car obligations which otherwise would have arisen as a consequence of the business transferred 
as previously noted  additional information about car  including regulatory reform  is in item of this form k 
insurance holding company structure 
as an insurance holding company  we are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company statutes of the states in which our subsidiary insurance companies are incorporated 
because our subsidiaries are members of an insurance holding company system  they are required to register with their respective divisions of insurance and to submit reports describing the capital structure  general financial condition  ownership and management of each insurer and any person or entity controlling the insurer  the identity of every member of the insurance holding company system  and the material outstanding transactions between the insurer and its affiliates 
california and ohio have insurance holding company laws similar to those in massachusetts 
each member of the insurance holding company system must keep current the information required to be disclosed by reporting all material changes or additions within days of the end of the month in which it learns of such change or addition 
massachusetts law prohibits a party that is not a domestic insurer from acquiring control of a domestic insurer or of a company controlling a domestic insurer without prior approval of the commissioner 
control is presumed to exist if a party directly or indirectly holds  owns or controls ten percent or more of the voting stock of another party  but may be rebutted by showing that control does not exist 
california and ohio have laws similar to those in massachusetts 
in the event of the insolvency  liquidation or other reorganization of any of our insurance subsidiaries  our creditors and stockholders will have no right to proceed against the assets of those subsidiaries  or to cause the liquidation or bankruptcy of any company under federal or state bankruptcy laws 
state laws govern such liquidation or rehabilitation proceedings and the division of insurance would act as receiver for the particular company 
creditors and policyholders of the insurance subsidiaries would be entitled to payment in full from such assets before a stockholder  such as commerce holdings in our case  would be entitled to receive any distribution therefrom 
payment of dividends 
under massachusetts law  an insurer may pay cash dividends only from earnings and statutory surplus  and the insurer s remaining surplus must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate in relation to its financial needs 
following the declaration and payment of such dividends  the insurer must file a report with the commissioner 
a massachusetts insurance company may not pay an extraordinary dividend or distribution unless the insurer gives the commissioner at least days prior notice of the declaration and the commissioner does not disapprove of the plan of payment prior to the date of such payment 
an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution whose fair market value together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months exceeds the greater of of surplus  or net income for the month period ending the st day of d ecember 
california and ohio have laws similar to those in massachusetts regulating the payment of dividends by insurance companies 
the aggregate amount of dividends calculated in accordance with regulations in massachusetts  california and ohio that could have been paid in from sources from all of our insurance subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval was approximately  of which  was declared and paid during in addition  previously unused dividend capability for the last eleven years from all of our insurance subsidiaries  which can also be used for dividend issuance without regulatory approval  totaled approximately  protection against insurer insolvency 
all insurance companies are required to participate in insurance insolvency fund programs in the states in which they write

national association of insurance commissioners guidelines 
the naic insurance regulatory information system  or iris  was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is intended primarily to assist state insurance regulators in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies eleven industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio 
departure from the usual values on four or more of the ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state insurance commissioners as to certain aspects of an insurer s business 
for the year ended december   our consolidated property and casualty operations had no ratios outside the usual values 
in order to enhance the regulation of insurer insolvency  the naic developed a formula and model law to provide for risk based capital  or rbc  requirements for property and casualty insurance companies 
the model law has since been adopted in all states 
rbc requirements are designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations 
the rbc model for property and casualty insurance companies measures three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers underwriting  which encompasses the risk of adverse loss development and inadequate pricing  declines in asset values arising from credit risk  and other business risks from investments 
insurers having less statutory surplus than required by the rbc calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action  depending on the level of capital inadequacy 
the rbc model formula has four levels of regulatory action 
the extent of regulatory intervention and action increases as the percentage of surplus to rbc falls 
the first level  defined by the naic as the company action level  requires an insurer to submit a plan of corrective actions to the regulator if surplus falls below of the rbc amount 
as indicated in the following table  the rbc level of each of our insurance subsidiaries at december  significantly exceeded the rbc level requirements 
commerce citation american commerce commerce west statutory surplus rbc company action level statutory surplus in excess of rbc company action level rbc amounts percent of surplus to rbc amounts competition the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  characterized by periods of increasing premium rates and limited underwriting capacity  followed by periods of intensive price competition and abundant underwriting capacity 
this industry also is highly competitive  with a large number of companies  many of which operate in more than one state  offering automobile  homeowners  commercial property and other lines of insurance 
some of our competitors have larger volumes of business and greater financial resources than we have and some sell insurance directly to policyholders rather than through independent agents 
massachusetts 
our insurance products are marketed exclusively through independent agencies  including erps 
because most of our voluntary agencies represent more than one company  we face competition within each of these agencies 
we compete for business within independent agencies by offering a more attractively priced product through our aaa discount to the consumer and by paying agents significant compensation in the form of commissions and profit sharing 
we also seek to provide a consistent market  prompt servicing of policyholder claims and effective agency support services 
we have agreed that we shall be the exclusive underwriter of massachusetts personal automobile group programs for three aaa clubs  and we have extended our agreements with them from a minimum of three years to a minimum of twenty years 
we believe that the massachusetts regulatory environment requires a commitment to the market that certain companies have been unwilling to make  and thus have not established a presence or expanded their market share in massachusetts 
we believe that previous proposals to change the massachusetts personal auto system reflect a desire expressed by some to change the massachusetts system for regulating automobile insurance to one that is comparable to the regulatory framework in most other states 
any material change to the regulatory environment in massachusetts could adversely affect our business 
for additional information  see massachusetts personal automobile insurance in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this form k 
other states 
we compete with various regional and domestic insurers  national agency companies and direct writers 
any of these competitors could undertake actions that could adversely affect our profitability  such as pricing automobile insurance premiums more aggressively or offering greater compensation to independent agencies 
our employees as of december   we employed  people 
commerce employed  people  american commerce employed people  commerce west employed people  and citation had no employees

risk factors there are various risks involved in investing in the company  some of which are described below 
investors should carefully consider each of the following factors and all of the other financial information in this annual report  including the information incorporated by reference 
regulatory or legislative changes to enhance competition in massachusetts are being considered and  if enacted  could adversely affect our market share and profitability 
from time to time  the massachusetts division of insurance considers potential changes and reforms to the massachusetts personal automobile insurance system that would have the goal of enhancing competition 
massachusetts is currently the only state that we write business in where personal automobile insurance rates are set by state regulators 
the massachusetts regulatory environment currently requires personal automobile insurers to issue a policy to any eligible applicant who seeks one  known as the take all comers requirement  fixes maximum personal automobile rates  which has the effect of keeping premiums artificially low on specific high risk segments of the market  such as urban and youthful drivers  effectively imposing higher premiums on lower risk segments  fixes the sdip point assignment criteria and rating factors  assigns certain agents that have not been able to obtain a voluntary contract with another insurer  known as exclusive representative producers  or erps  to servicing carriers on the basis of market share  apportions losses incurred by the state mandated residual market run by commonwealth automobile reinsurers  known as car  mandates that higher compulsory and optional coverages be offered to all eligible drivers  and establishes minimum agency commissions 
our marketing and underwriting strategies are limited by maximum premium rates and minimum agency commission levels for personal automobile insurance  which are mandated by the commissioner 
rate decisions by the commissioner are based upon claims experience and other data which are several years old and may not reflect current conditions 
the rates set by the commissioner affect our results 
future increases in commission rates would also adversely affect our results of operations unless there were corresponding increases in premiums 
changes in the prevailing legislative or regulatory environment could adversely affect our competitive position 
we are unable to predict what  if any  changes that may be approved  or changes to the regulatory system that the division or car may implement and  therefore are unable to determine whether the impact would be favorable or unfavorable to us  and the effect  if any  that it would have on competition  nor can we predict when any changes would take effect 
we are primarily a personal automobile insurance carrier  and therefore our business may be adversely affected by changing conditions in the industry 
approximately of our direct premiums written for the year ended december  were generated from personal automobile insurance policies 
as a result of our focus on that line of business  negative developments in the economic  competitive or regulatory conditions affecting the personal automobile insurance industry could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
factors that negatively affect cost trends and our profitability include inflation in automobile repair costs  automobile parts costs  used car prices and medical care costs 
increased litigation of claims may also adversely affect loss costs 
in addition  these developments in the personal automobile insurance industry would have a disproportionate effect on us  compared to insurers that are more diversified across multiple business lines 
we write a substantial portion of our business in massachusetts  and therefore our business may be adversely affected by changing conditions and adverse legislative  regulatory and judicial decisions in massachusetts 
approximately of our direct premiums written for the year ended december  were generated in massachusetts 
therefore  our revenues and profitability are subject to prevailing regulatory  economic  demographic  competitive and other conditions  including weather related events as described below  and regulatory and judicial decisions in massachusetts 
changes in any of these conditions or the rendering of an adverse regulatory and judicial decision could make it more costly or difficult for us to conduct our business 
in addition  these developments would have a disproportionate effect on us  compared to insurers that do not have such a geographic concentration 
our financial performance may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic losses 
we are exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes 
catastrophes can be caused by natural events  such as hurricanes  coastal storms  severe ice or snow storms  tornadoes  windstorms  earthquakes  hailstorms and fires  and man made events  such as explosions  terrorist attacks or riots 
the incidence and severity of such catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and our losses from catastrophes could be substantial 
the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events is likely to result in substantial volatility in our financial condition or results of operations and our ability to write new business 
this volatility is compounded by accounting regulations that do not permit insurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur 
the occurrence of severe weather conditions is inherently unpredictable 
there is generally an increase in claims frequency and severity under the personal automobile insurance we write when severe weather occurs because of a higher incidence of vehicular accidents and other insured losses tend to occur as a result of severe weather conditions 
we do not carry reinsurance for physical damage or comprehensive catastrophic related losses for our personal or commercial automobile product lines 
in addition  we have exposure to an increase in claims frequency and severity under the homeowners and other property insurance we write because property damage may result from severe weather conditions 
some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas  however  hurricanes  coastal storms  tornadoes  winter storms  windstorms  earthquakes  terrorist attacks and other man made catastrophes may produce significant damage over large  heavily populated areas 
although we participate in a reinsurance program to limit our exposure to these types of natural catastrophes  we would have no reinsurance recoveries for a single event catastrophe to the extent that the total loss exceeds  we would have no reinsurance coverage for terrorist events 
although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events  a single catastrophic event could affect multiple geographic zones or the frequency or severity of catastrophic events could exceed our estimates 
as a result  the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we are part of a joint underwriting association that provides excess loss coverage to nuclear power plants and related facilities 
our maximum exposure in in the event of a catastrophic loss at an insured nuclear facility was  for domestic risks and  for foreign risks 
for  these exposure amounts increased to  and  respectively 
if we are not able to attract and retain independent agents  our business could be adversely affected 
we market our insurance primarily through independent agents 
we must compete with other insurance carriers for the business of these independent agents 
additionally  most agents represent more than one company  which means we face competition within each agency 
some of our competitors offer a larger variety of products  lower prices for insurance coverage or higher compensation 
while we believe that the compensation and services we provide to our agents are competitive with other insurers  changes in compensation  services or products offered by our competitors could make it harder for us to attract and retain independent agents to sell our insurance products 
if our affinity relationship with one or more aaa clubs  especially in massachusetts  were to be terminated  we would lose a significant avenue for our affinity programs  which would likely lead to a decline in our sales of personal automobile insurance products  that would then adversely affect our business and results of operations 
since  we have actively pursued affinity group marketing programs  which provide participating groups with a means of purchasing discounted private passenger automobile insurance through associations and employer groups 
the aaa affinity program is the largest of these affinity programs 
this is especially true in massachusetts  where a significant portion of our massachusetts premiums written is derived through the aaa affinity program 
direct written premiums written through the aaa affinity program during totaled  or of total direct written premiums or of massachusetts direct written premiums 
in massachusetts  we are the exclusive underwriter of personal automobile group programs for three aaa clubs 
as of february  we have signed agreements to extend our exclusive agreement with these clubs from a minimum of three years to a minimum of twenty years 
direct premiums written by american commerce in the top five states in which american commerce does business  excluding arizona  represented  or of american commerce s direct premiums written and of our total direct premiums written in furthermore  all of american commerce s business in each of these states is generated by one or more insurance agencies owned by a single aaa club in that state  with limited exceptions 
we have particularly significant relationships with aaa sne that are important to various aspects of our business 
since we have maintained an exclusive affinity group marketing relationship with a massachusetts agency controlled by aaa sne 
in  that agency wrote the greatest amount of our massachusetts personal automobile business  accounting for  or of our total direct premiums written 
aaa sne also controls a rhode island insurance agency that in produced  of direct premiums written for our subsidiary american commerce  representing of our total direct premiums written for that year 
in addition  aaa sne owns a equity interest in acic holding  the holding company of american commerce that is owned by us 
should one or more of the significant aaa clubs elect to terminate its exclusive agreement  we would lose a significant avenue for offering affinity discounts  and we may not be able to achieve comparable sales through different affinity programs or otherwise 
we also expect that we would lose the business written through any insurance agency owned by an aaa club that elects to terminate its exclusive arrangement with us 
a termination of relationships with aaa sne agencies could also adversely affect our ability to develop or maintain relationships with other aaa clubs 
for these reasons  the termination of our exclusive arrangement with one or more of the aaa clubs may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we are a holding company with no direct operations  and our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to us is restricted by law 
as a holding company with no direct operations and whose only significant assets are the capital stock of our subsidiaries  we rely on net investment income  dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to pay our expenses 
our subsidiaries may not be able to generate cash flow sufficient to pay a dividend or distribute funds to us 
in addition  applicable state laws that regulate the payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries could prohibit such dividends or distributions 
under massachusetts law  an insurer may pay cash dividends only from earnings and statutory surplus  and the insurer s remaining surplus must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate in relation to its financial needs 
following the declaration and payment of such dividends  the insurer must file a report with the commissioner 
a massachusetts insurance company may not pay an extraordinary dividend or distribution unless the insur er gives the commissioner at least days prior notice of the declaration and the commissioner does not disapprove of the plan of payment prior to the date of such payment 
an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution whose fair market value together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months exceeds the greater of of surplus  or net income for the month period ending the st day of december 
california and ohio have laws similar to those in massachusetts regulating the payment of dividends by insurance companies 
if our insurance subsidiaries cannot pay dividends in future periods we may have difficulty servicing our debt  paying dividends on our shares of common stock and meeting our holding company expenses 
established competitors with greater resources may make it difficult for us to market our products effectively and offer our products at a profit 
we compete with various regional and domestic insurers  national agency companies and direct writers 
some of these competitors have financial resources greater than ours 
any of these competitors could undertake actions that could adversely affect our profitability  such as pricing automobile insurance premiums more aggressively or offering greater compensation to independent agencies 
the present soft market exacerbates the risk of these competitive actions 
we may not be able to preclude other companies from engaging in insurance related business in massachusetts using the words commerce and insurance in its name or service marks  and we believe that our business will be harmed if any other company in fact conducts insurance related business in massachusetts using the words commerce and insurance in its name or service marks 
commerce insurance  which has been writing business in massachusetts for more than years under the names and marks the commerce insurance company and commerce insurance company  holds massachusetts state registrations for those marks  but no federal registrations 
we have reason to believe that commerce bancorp  inc  a new york stock exchange listed financial services company  and its subsidiary commerce insurance services  inc d b a commerce insurance brokerage services  both of cherry hill  new jersey  are now in  or are on the verge of entering  massachusetts to provide a variety of broker and agency insurance services under variants of the mark commerce insurance 
commerce bancorp has acquired or is seeking to acquire federal registrations for marks including the words commerce and insurance 
in august  commerce bancorp filed applications in the united states patent and trademark office the pto to reg ister the mark commerce insurance services and the mark commerce c insurance services and related design 
moreover  we understand that commerce bancorp acquired by assignment from the original owner the federal registration for the mark commerce that was issued in for use in connection with insurance agencies featuring home  accident  life  property  casualty and business insurance 
in may  we began opposing both of the applications filed by commerce bancorp in a proceeding before the trademark trial and appeal board 
the trademark trial and appeal board has suspended the proceeding before it pending resolution of a lawsuit filed by our subsidiary commerce insurance in the federal district court of massachusetts against commerce bancorp and commerce insurance services on february  in the complaint  commerce insurance sought preliminary and permanent injunctions and damages against commerce bancorp and commerce insurance services for trade name and service mark infringement and unfair competition under federal statutory law and for trade name and service mark infringement  unfair competition  and dilution under massachusetts statutory and common law 
the commerce insurance complaint alleges  among other things  that the use in massachusetts by commerce bancorp and commerce insurance services of marks including the words commerce and insurance will create the likelihood of dilution of our commerce insurance marks  because our marks are either inherently distinctive or have acquired secondary meaning  and are likely to be confused with the commerce bancorp and commerce insurance services use of their marks 
on july   the court held a hearing  at which a judicial stipulation was made on behalf of commerce bancorp  inc and commerce insurance services that the defendants no longer intended to use the name commerce insurance services  inc in massachusetts 
on july   in light of the judicial stipulation made on behalf of the defendants  we withdrew  without prejudice  our pending motion for preliminary injunction 
on june   commerce bancorp filed an application in the pto to register the mark commerce c banc insurance services plus design the design mark 
on august   commerce bancorp filed an application in the pto to register the mark commerce banc insurance services the word mark 
the application to register the design mark was published for opposition on february   and the application to register the word mark was to be published for opposition on february  commerce intends to oppose these applications 
on october   we filed a supplemental complaint in federal district court to supplement our claims to include the defendants intended use of the name commerce banc insurance services in massachusetts 
the defendants responded on november  the case is proceeding in the united states district court of massachusetts  and discovery closes on march  no trial date has been set 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in opposing commerce bancorp and commerce insurance services either in federal district court or before the trademark trial and appeal board 
if our opposition is unsuccessful  we believe that we will continue to be able to use the marks commerce insurance  the commerce insurance company and commerce insurance company in massachusetts  but that our business will be harmed if commerce bancorp and commerce insurance services in fact conduct insurance related business in massachusetts using the words commerce and insurance 
we are subject to comprehensive regulation by massachusetts as well as the other states in which we operate  and our ability to earn profits may be restricted by changes to these regulations 
general regulation 
we are subject to regulation by government agencies in massachusetts  as well as in the other states in which we operate  and we must obtain prior approval for certain corporate actions 
in massachusetts  for example  we must comply with regulations involving mandatory underwriting  commonly known as take all comers regulations  transactions between an insurance company and any of its affiliates  the payment of dividends  the acquisition of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company  approval or filing of premium rates and policy forms  approval of the sdip and rating factors  solvency standards  minimum amounts of capital and surplus that must be maintained  limitations on types and amounts of investments  restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured by a single company  limitations on the right to cancel or choose not to renew policies in some lines  regulation of the right to withdraw from markets or terminate involvement with agencies  requirements to participate in residual markets  such as car  or other state mandated insurance pools  licensing of insurers and agents  deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders  and reporting with respect to financial condition 
the other states in which we operate have similar regulations 
in addition  insurance department examiners from massachusetts  california and ohio perform periodic financial and market conduct examinations of insurance companies 
such regulation is generally intended for the protection of policyholders rather than security holders 
massachusetts requires that all licensed property and casualty insurers bear a portion of the losses suffered by some insureds as a result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies 
in  and  we were assessed  and  respectively  by the massachusetts insurance insolvency fund miif as our portion of these losses 
in addition  massachusetts has established an underwriting association in order to ensure that property insurance is available for owners of high risk property who are not able to obtain insurance from private insurers 
the losses of this underwriting association are shared by all insurers that write property and casualty insurance in massachusetts 
we are assessed from time to time to pay those losses 
the effect of these assessments could reduce our profitability in any given period and limit our ability to grow our business 
additionally  commerce west and american commerce are domiciled in california and ohio  respectively  and are both covered by similar associations in the states in which they do business 
these associations operate similarly to the massachusetts association described above 
in  and  we were refunded assessed  and  respectively  by these associations 
we are unable to predict future changes in the political  economic or regulatory environments in massachusetts and other states 
we cannot assure you that existing insurance related laws and regulations will not become more restrictive in the future or that new restrictive laws will not be enacted  and we cannot predict the potential effects on us of any such laws and regulations 
commonwealth automobile reinsurers program 
we are subject to the extensive regulation of the private passenger and commercial automobile insurance industry in massachusetts  and our ability to earn profits may be restricted by these requirements 
owners of automobiles are required to demonstrate minimum automobile insurance coverage prior to registration 
generally  we are required by law to issue a policy to any applicant who seeks it 
on the basis of our market share  we are assigned erps 
in addition  we are required to participate in the state mandated reinsurance program run by car  to which we may cede risks that we believe are underpriced and from which we are allocated a portion of the program s overall losses 
since its inception  car has annually generated underwriting losses  primarily in the personal automobile pool 
all companies underwriting automobile insurance in massachusetts share in the underwriting results of the car business for their respective product line or lines 
a company s proportionate share of the car personal automobile results is based on its market share  adjusted by a utilization formula such that  in general  a company s participation ratio is disproportionately and adversely affected if its relative use of car reinsurance exceeds that of the industry  and favorably affected if its relative use of car reinsurance is less than that of the industry 
participation in the car commercial automobile results is based on a company s voluntary market share 
finally  for the personal automobile car pool  an insurer s participation ratio may be affected by credits received for not reinsuring through car automobile risks in selected underpriced classes and territories 
an insurer s participation ratio will be favorably affected if its relative use of credits exceeds that of the massachusetts industry 
credit values are set annually by car  and we cannot forecast whether the yearly changes will be beneficial or detrimental to the results of our personal automobile insurance business 
member companies of car have joint and several liabilities for the obligations of car 
if one member of car fails to pay its assessments  each of the remaining members of car will be required to pay its pro rata share of the member who fails to pay its obligations 
as a result of the concentration of the massachusetts market for personal automobile insurance  the assessment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if one of the leading companies were to fail 
at the present time  we are not aware of any car member company who has failed to meet its obligation 
massachusetts has considered alternative methods to car for structuring the residual or involuntary market 
most recently  in december  the former commissioner approved rules which would have instituted an assigned risk plan  the massachusetts automobile insurance plan maip  to provide private passenger automobile insurance for those individuals unable to obtain insurance voluntarily  in place of car 
an assigned risk plan would place these individuals directly with an assigned insurance company 
these rules were to be effective april  for certain new business  july  for sdip point and above new and renewal business and january  for all business except clean in three renewals 
however  on january   the acting commissioner suspended these rules for up to ninety days in order to hear additional comment 
a public hearing was held on february  in addition  a new commissioner was named during february we are unable to predict the outcome of the hearing or what  if any  changes to the current massachusetts residual market mechanism may occur or determine the effect of any decision on our financial condition or results of operations 
if we unexpectedly lose certain key personnel  or are unable to attract and retain talented employees and executives  our ability to conduct business successfully could be hindered 
our future success depends significantly upon the continued contributions of certain key management personnel 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers  nor do we have key man life insurance policies covering them 
the unexpected loss of the services and the institutional knowledge of any one of these officers could adversely affect our business and harm our results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  our ability to continue profitable growth and to remain a competitive force in the marketplace depends  in part  on our ability to hire and retain talented employees 
during  arthur j 
remillard  jr  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  retired and was replaced by gerald fels  who was then executive vice president  as president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board 
we had employed mr 
remillard  jr 
and gerald fels for approximately years 
randall v 
becker  employed at commerce since  was elected to succeed mr 
fels as chief financial officer  effective february  we have employed our eleven executive officers for an average of approximately years 
new claim  coverage and regulatory issues in the insurance industry may adversely affect us 
as insurance industry practices and regulatory  judicial  and consumer conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims  coverage and underwriting may emerge 
the issues can have a negative effect on our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the size of claims 
recent examples of emerging claims  coverage and underwriting issues include a growing trend of plaintiffs targeting automobile insurers in purported class action litigation relating to claims handling practices such as total loss evaluation methodology and cases outside of massachusetts alleging that insureds are entitled to recover the inherent diminution in the value of their vehicles involved in accidents  increases in the number and size of water damage claims  including those related to expenses for testing and remediation of mold conditions  the use of an applicant s credit rating as a factor in making risk selection and pricing decisions  the availability of coverages that pay different commission levels to agents depending upon premium level  and coverage for wind versus flood damage 
these and other unforeseen emerging claim  coverage and underwriting issues could negatively affect our results of operations or our methods of doing business 
we cannot assure you that our diversification strategy will be effective 
we expect that our primary focus will continue to be our core business in massachusetts and on enhancing our geographic diversity by increasing the proportion of business that we originate from the other states where we now have a significant presence 
in addition  we have sought and may continue to seek to take advantage of opportunities that may arise to expand our core business into other states where we believe the independent agent distribution channel is strong or where american commerce is able to establish new relationships with aaa clubs 
other than our previously announced expansion into new york and new jersey through the swico acquisition  we do not currently have expansion plans  other than in the states in which we currently write business 
as a result of a number of factors  including the difficulties of finding appropriate expansion opportunities and the challenges of operating in an unfamiliar market  we may not be successful in finding opp ortunities to expand into other states or in taking advantage of opportunities that we may identify 
we have not dedicated a specific amount of resources toward any of those diversification strategies for states in which we do not have a presence 
there can be no assurance that any of the aforementioned strategies will ultimately be successful 
our failure to maintain a commercially acceptable financial strength rating would significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy successfully 
an important factor in an insurer s ability to compete effectively is its financial strength rating 
am best generally is considered to be a leading authority on insurance company ratings and information 
am best assigns ratings to insurance companies  which currently range from a superior to f in liquidation 
am best has currently assigned each of our insurance subsidiaries a combined a superior rating  which is the second highest rating issued by am best 
according to am best  an insurer with a superior rating has a superior ability to meet its ongoing obligations to policyholders 
each of the insurance subsidiaries has also been assigned a stable outlook by am best  which indicates a company is experiencing stable financial market trends  and there is a low likelihood that its rating will change in the near term 
moody s investor services also rates the financial strength of insurance companies  and has assigned an a good rating to commerce  which is moody s third highest rating 
according to moody s an insurer with an a good rating offers good financial security  with elements present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future 
moody s assigns nine ratings to insurance companies  which currently range from aaa to c  with a numerical modifier in each generic rating classification to refer to the ranking in the group  with being the highest and being the lowest 
moody s divides their ratings into strong and weak companies  with companies in one of the top four rating categories being considered strong companies 
additionally  standard poor s rates the financial strength of insurance companies and assigns eight ratings  which currently range from aaa to cc  and may further modify that rating with a or a to show relative standing within the category 
s p has assigned an a rating  its third highest rating  to commerce and citation 
according to s p  an insurer with an a rating has strong financial security characteristics  but is somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are insurers with higher ratings 
am best  moody s and s p base their ratings on factors that concern policyholders and not upon factors concerning investor protection 
such ratings are subject to change and are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities 
any future decrease in the ratings of one of our subsidiaries could adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition  reinsurance companies and financial institutions use am best and other insurance ratings to help assess the financial strength and quality of insurance companies 
a decline in the ratings of our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries may dissuade a reinsurance company or financial institution from conducting business with us or they may increase our reinsurance or interest costs 
our losses and loss adjustment expenses may exceed our reserves  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  or lae  that we have established are estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related expenses based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the time we establish the reserves 
reserves are based on historical claims information  industry statistics and other factors 
the establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process 
this uncertainty arises from a number of factors  including the difficulty in predicting the rate of inflation and the rate and direction of changes in trends  interpretation of insurance policy provisions by courts  inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and expanded theories of liability 
in addition  changes in claims settlement practices can lead to changes in loss payment patterns  which are used to estimate reserve levels 
there can be no assurance that our ultimate liability will not materially exceed our res erves 
due to the inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves  it has been necessary  and will over time continue to be necessary  to revise estimated future liabilities as reflected in our reserves for claims and policy expenses 
if our reserves subsequently are found to be inadequate and therefore must be strengthened  we would be required to treat the amount of such increase as a charge to our earnings in the period that the deficiency is recognized  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the historical development of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses may not necessarily reflect future trends in the development of these amounts 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate redundancies or deficiencies based on historical information 
market fluctuations and changes in interest rates have had  and may continue to have  significant and negative effects on our investment portfolio and stockholders equity 
our results of operations depend in part on the performance of our invested assets 
we had fixed maturity  preferred stock and preferred stock mutual fund investments with a market value of billion at december  that are subject to market value risk  which is the risk that our invested assets will decrease in value  due to a change in the prevailing market yields on our investments  an unfavorable change in the liquidity of an investment or an unfavorable change in the financial prospects or a downgrade in the credit rating of the issuer of an investment or one or more other factors  reinvestment risk  which is the risk that interest rates will decline  an investment will be redeemed and we will not be able to reinvest the proceeds in a comparable investment that provides a yield equal to or greater than the investment which was redeemed  and liquidity risk  which is the risk that we may have to sell assets at an undesirable time and or price to provide for payment of claims or other liabilities 
in addition  our investment portfolio is subject to risks inherent in the domestic and international capital markets 
the functioning of those markets  the value of our investments and our ability to liquidate investments on short notice may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted by national or international events including  without limitation  wars  terrorist attacks  recessions or depressions  high inflation or a deflationary environment  the collapse of governments or financial markets  and other factors or events 
our fixed maturity investment portfolio includes mortgage backed and other asset backed securities 
as of december   mortgage backed securities and other asset backed securities constituted approximately of our cash and invested assets 
as with other fixed maturity investments  the fair value of these securities fluctuates depending on market and other general economic conditions and the interest rate environment 
changes in interest rates can expose us to prepayment risks on these investments 
in periods of declining interest rates  mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage backed securities and other asset backed securities are paid more quickly  requiring us to reinvest the proceeds at the then current market rates 
we seek to maintain a proper amount of diversity and liquidity in our portfolio  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard 
if our portfolio were to be impaired by market or issuer specific conditions to a substantial degree  our liquidity  financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
further  our income from these investments could be materially reduced  and write downs of the value of certain securities could further reduce our profitability 
in addition  a decrease in value of our investment portfolio could put our subsidiaries at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory capital requirements 
if we were not at that time able to supplement our capital by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms  our ability to continue growing could be adversely affected 
we continue to monitor the effects of changing interest rates on the value of our fixed maturity and preferred stock investments 
we estimate that a basis point immediate increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of those investments at december  by  or  our ownership interests in closed end preferred stock mutual funds may cause our capital gains losses and corresponding net earnings to be more volatile than many other similar companies 
our net earnings have been significantly affected by our ownership interests in closed end preferred stock mutual funds that we account for using the equity method of accounting 
for our investment in any fund in which we own or more of the fund s share  the equity method of accounting requires us to categorize as a realized investment gain or loss the change in the net asset value of that fund as compared to the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter 
these funds primarily invest in preferred stock and  therefore  an increase in interest rates would cause a significant decrease in the respective net asset values of those funds and  as a direct consequence  a significant increase in the net realized investment losses that we would recognize for those investments 
as of december   we had investments in three funds  with a carrying value of  in which we own more than of the funds shares and therefore account for them under t he equity method of accounting 
we may not be able to successfully alleviate risk through reinsurance arrangements  which could cause us to reduce our premiums written in certain lines or could result in losses 
in order to reduce risk and increase our underwriting capacity  we purchase reinsurance 
the availability and the cost of reinsurance protection is subject to market conditions  which are outside of our control 
a catastrophe  even if it primarily affects a geographic area outside of our markets  could significantly limit the availability of reinsurance  which would adversely affect our ability to obtain reinsurance 
as a result  we may not be able to successfully alleviate risk through these arrangements 
in addition  we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurance because the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders 
a significant reinsurer s insolvency or inability to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our results may fluctuate due to the highly cyclical nature of the insurance industry 
historically  the financial performance of the property and casualty insurance industry has tended to fluctuate in cyclical patterns of soft markets followed by hard markets 
although an individual insurance company s financial performance is dependent on its own specific business characteristics  the profitability of most property and casualty insurance companies tends to follow this cyclical market pattern 
we cannot predict with certainty how long any soft or hard market will last 
the failure of a key third party service vendor would adversely affect our ability to timely write massachusetts automobile policies  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
we use an unrelated third party service vendor  cgi technologies and solutions  inc cgi tech  to provide rating and policy production data to us for use in underwriting our massachusetts personal and commercial automobile policies 
cgi tech is a wholly owned subsidiary of cgi group  inc  a provider of information technology services with which we have done business since the s 
cgi tech may terminate the service agreement only in the event of a material breach of the agreement by us or upon our insolvency 
the agreement also provides that if cgi tech is no longer able to make the service available  we have the option to license immediately the software used by cgi tech for a fee of in the event that cgi tech becomes unable to provide us these services and we were to exercise the option to license the software  we would have to transition either to our own mainframe or to leased computer facilities  which we believe could take up to days and possibly longer  depending primarily on availability of computer hardware and information technology personnel 
during this period  we would have to process manually renewals and new applications in house  which would significantly slow our processing time 
due to the variables involved  we are unable to estimate the length of the interruption or the expense we would incur in such a case  but we expect that such a disruption would adversely affect our future customer and agency relations and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
on november   we renewed our service agreement with cgi tech  the term of the agreement is to run until december  we signed on november  an addendum that provides for cgi tech to convert to a new processing system  and extends our contract for two years 
however  it is contingent on them getting two of their other clients to sign and only one has signed 
if we were to lose the services of cgi tech and determine that licensing their software was not practicable  we do believe that alternative sources for these services would be available 
we are unable to estimate whether the annual cost for these services would be higher or lower than our costs under the current agreement  though we do not believe that the difference for these services would materially affect our results of operations in future periods 
we expect  however  that a transition to an alternate vendor would take a significant amount of time and expense 
due to the variables involved  we are unable to estimate the length of the interruption or the expense we would incur in such a case  but we expect that such an interruption could adversely affect our customer and agency relations  and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we rely on our information technology and telecommunication systems  and the failure of these systems could materially and adversely affect our business 
increasingly  our businesses are dependent on computer and internet enabled technology 
although we have and test various disaster recovery plans  a sustained shutdown of one or more of our facilities  or a failure of one or more of our information technology  telecommunications or other business systems  could significantly impair our ability to perform our normal functions on a timely basis 
in addition  because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems  we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or third party systems fail or experience interruptions 
if sustained or repeated  such a business interruption  systems failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new or renewal business  provide customer service  pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary corporate functions 
this could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and future customer relations 
we maintain insurance on our real property and other physical assets 
this insurance will not fully compensate us for losses that may occur due to disruptions in service as a result of a computer  data processing or telecommunications system failure that is unrelated to covered property damage  nor will such insurance necessarily compensate us adequately for all losses resulting from covered events 
although we have an agreement that provides us with off site disaster recovery back up systems  we do not have a contingency plan to relocate employees to an alternate location 
an element of our growth and diversification strategy is the acquisition of other property and casualty insurance companies 
any pending or future acquisition we decide to undertake will involve risks 
the acquisition and integration of other similar property and casualty insurance companies is an element of our growth and diversification strategy 
this strategy depends on identifying suitable acquisition opportunities and reaching mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses could require us to incur significant costs or utilize significant resources 
further  acquisitions may result in dilution for the owners of our common stock  our incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  and fluctuations in quarterly results 
in addition  the businesses and other assets we acquire may not achieve the financial results that we expected 
item b 
unresolved staff comments we do not have any unresolved written comments regarding our periodic or current reports that were received from the staff of the united states securities and exchange commission not less than days before december  item properties we conduct our operations for our property and casualty massachusetts segment from approximately  square feet of space in several buildings that we own in webster  massachusetts  which is located approximately miles southwest of boston 
our data processing and operational departments are housed in modern office buildings 
our property and casualty other than massachusetts segment consists primarily of the operations of commerce west and american commerce 
commerce west currently leases approximately  square feet of office space in pleasanton  california 
american commerce conducts its operations from approximately  square feet of space in a building it owns located on a two acre site in columbus  ohio 
american commerce also leases property at three district claims offices 
item legal proceedings as is common with property and casualty insurance companies  we are a defendant in various legal actions arising from the normal course of our business  including claims based on massachusetts chapter d and chapter a 
see settlement of claims 
similar provisions exist in other states where we do business 
we consider these proceedings to be ordinary to operations or without foundation in fact 
we believe that these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
aaa arizona as previously disclosed  in aaa arizona  inc v 
american commerce insurance company united states district court for the district of arizona  originally filed on may   aaa arizona alleges  among other claims  that american commerce has violated its contract with aaa arizona by failing to pay approximately  in profit sharing that aaa arizona claims to have earned during aaa arizona also alleges that american commerce is interfering with aaa arizona s relationship with its members 
aaa arizona seeks an order from the court and an award of actual and consequential damages in total of approximately  we cannot estimate  as of the date of this form k  the amount of consequential damages that may be awarded to aaa arizona if it is successful 
american commerce intends to vigorously defend against aaa arizona s claims unless a reasonable settlement appears appropriate 
commerce bancorp 
commerce insurance  which has been writing business in massachusetts for more than years under the names and marks the commerce insurance company and commerce insurance company  holds massachusetts state registrations for those marks  but no federal registrations 
we have reason to believe that commerce bancorp  inc  a new york stock exchange listed financial services company  and its subsidiary commerce insurance services  inc d b a commerce insurance brokerage services  both of cherry hill  new jersey  are now in  or are on the verge of entering  massachusetts to provide a variety of insurance services under variants of the mark commerce insurance 
commerce bancorp has acquired or is seeking to acquire federal registrations for marks including the words commerce and insurance 
in august  commerce bancorp filed applications in the united states patent and trademark office the pto to register the mark commerce insurance services and the mark commerce c insurance services and related design 
moreover  we understand that commerce bancorp acquired by assignment from the original owner the federal registration for the mark commerce that was issued in for use in connection with insurance agencies featuring home  accident  life  property  casualty and business insurance 
in may  we began opposing both of the applications filed by commerce bancorp in a proceeding before the trademark trial and appeal board 
the trademark trial and appeal board has suspended the proceeding before it pending resolution of a lawsuit filed by our subsidiary commerce insurance in the federal district court of massachusetts against commerce bancorp and commerce insurance services on february  in the complaint  commerce insurance sought preliminary and permanent injunctions and damages against commerce bancorp and commerce insurance services for trade name and service mark infringement and unfair competition under federal statutory law and for trade name and service mark infringement  unfair competition  and dilution under massachusetts statutory and common law 
the commerce insurance complaint alleges  among other things  that the use in massachusetts by commerce bancorp and commerce insurance services of marks including the words commerce and insurance will create the likelihood of dilution of our commerce insurance marks  because our marks are either inherently distinctive or have acquired secondary meaning  and are likely to be confused with the commerce bancorp and commerce insurance services use of their marks 
on july   the court held a hearing  at which a judicial stipulation was made on behalf of commerce bancorp  inc and commerce insurance services that the defendants no longer intended to use the name commerce insurance services  inc in massachusetts 
on july   in light of the judicial stipulation made on behalf of the defendants  we withdrew  without prejudice  our pending motion for preliminary injunction 
on june   commerce bancorp filed an application in the pto to register the mark commerce c banc insurance services plus design the design mark 
on august   commerce bancorp filed an application in the pto to register the mark commerce banc insurance services the word mark 
the application to register the design mark was published for opposition on february   and the application to register the word mark was to be published for opposition on february  commerce intends to oppose these applications 
on october   we filed a supplemental complaint in federal district court to supplement our claims to include the defendants intended use of the name commerce banc insurance services in massachusetts 
the defendants responded on november  the case is proceeding in the united states district court of massachusetts  and discovery closes on march  no trial date has been set 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in opposing commerce bancorp and commerce insurance services either in federal district court or before the trademark trial and appeal board 
if our opposition is unsuccessful  we believe that we will continue to be able to use the marks commerce insurance  the commerce insurance company and commerce insurance company in massachusetts  but that our business will be harmed if commerce bancorp and commerce insurance services in fact conduct insurance related business in massachusetts using the words commerce and insurance

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of the following discussion and analysis is to provide you with information that will assist you in understanding our financial condition and results of operations as reported in our consolidated financial statements 
therefore  the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements in this form k 
business overview we provide personal and commercial property and casualty insurance primarily in massachusetts and in other states 
our core product lines are personal automobile  homeowners  and commercial automobile 
we market our products exclusively through our network of independent agents in all states  except california  where we use agents and brokers 
our primary business strategy is to focus on the personal automobile insurance market in massachusetts and to grow and diversify by increasing the proportion of our business written in other states in which we currently have a significant presence  primarily from commerce west and american commerce  and by expanding into the new york and new jersey personal lines markets through the swico acquisition 
we manage our business in four reportable segments property and casualty insurance massachusetts  property and casualty insurance other than massachusetts  real estate and commercial lending  and  corporate and other 
our ability to capitalize on our business strengths and implement our strategies is subject to particular risks 
for a discussion of these risks  see item a  risk factors  contained elsewhere in this form k 
massachusetts regulatory environment and commonwealth automobile reinsurers car overview the massachusetts regulatory environment for personal automobile insurance is characterized by the following key principles requiring personal automobile insurers to issue a policy to any eligible applicant who seeks one  known as the take all comers requirement  fixing maximum personal automobile rates  which has the effect of keeping premiums artificially low on specific high risk segments of the market  such as urban and youthful drivers  effectively imposing higher premiums on lower risk segments  assigning certain agents that have not been able to obtain a voluntary contract with another insurer  known as exclusive representative producers  or erps  to servicing carriers on the basis of market share  apportioning losses incurred by the state mandated residual market run by car  mandating that higher compulsory and optional coverages be offered to all eligible drivers  and establishing minimum agency commissions 
a significant aspect of our automobile insurance business relates to our interaction with car  which enables us and the other participating servicing carriers to reinsure any automobile risk which is perceived to be under priced 
since its inception  car has annually generated significant underwriting losses  primarily in the personal automobile pool 
all companies writing automobile insurance in massachusetts share in the underwriting results of car business for their respective product line or lines 
member companies of car have joint and several liabilities for the obligations of car 
if one member of car fails to pay its assessments  the remaining members will be required to pay the pro rata share of the member who fails to pay its obligations 
as of december   we were not aware of any current car member company which has failed to meet its obligations 
our revenues and expenses our revenue principally reflects earned premiums  consisting of premiums that we receive from sales by our agents of property and casualty insurance policies  primarily personal automobile  homeowners and commercial automobile  which we refer to as direct premiums written  plus premiums we receive from insurance policies that we assume  primarily from car  which we refer to as assumed premiums  less the portion of our premiums that is ceded to car and other reinsurers  which we refer to as ceded premiums  less the change in the portion of premiums that will not be recognized as income for accounting purposes until a future period  which we refer to as unearned premiums  investment income that we earn on our invested assets  premium finance charges and service fee income that we earn in connection with the billing and deferral of premium payments  and realized investment gains and losses 
our expenses principally reflect incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses which we sometimes refer to as lae  including estimates for losses incurred during the period but not yet reported to us and changes in estimates from prior periods related to direct and assumed business  less the portion of those incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses that are ceded to other insurers  and policy acquisition costs  including agent compensation and general and administrative costs  such as salaries and benefits  and advertising that are not deferred for accounting purposes to a future period 
our critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following accounting estimates  which are especially dependent upon our judgments and assumptions  to be critical to the preparation of our financial statements 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses represents our best estimate of the ultimate net cost of all loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred after reinsurance and amounts estimated to be recoverable through salvage and subrogation 
the estimate for the ultimate net cost of all losses incurred through the balance sheet date includes the adjusted case estimates for losses  incurred but not reported ibnr losses  salvage and subrogation recoverable and a reserve for lae 
in arriving at our best estimate  we begin with the aggregate of individual case reserves and then make adjustments to these amounts on a line of business basis 
the adjustment to the aggregate case reserves by line of business is made based on analyses performed by us 
the entire liability for unpaid losses and lae is also separately reviewed quarterly and annually by our actuarial department 
liability estimates are continual ly analyzed and updated  and therefore  the ultimate liability may be more or less than the current estimate 
the effects of changes in the estimates are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimates are revised 
the claim cycle begins when a claim is reported to us and claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of our exposure without regard to injury causality  third party liability or potential recoveries 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon an evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding the claim and the policy provisions relating to the loss 
this estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel adjusting the claim 
during the loss adjustment period  these case basis estimates are revised as deemed necessary by our claims department personnel based on subsequent developments and periodic reviews of the claim 
in accordance with industry practice  we also maintain reserves for estimated ibnr  salvage and subrogation recoverable and lae 
these reserves are determined based on historical information 
imbedded within the historical information are changes in the volume of policies written  claims frequency  severity and payment patterns  the mix of business and claims processing 
ibnr reserves are established for claims that have been incurred prior to year end but have not been reported to us until after year end 
our ibnr reserve is derived by analyzing the amount of losses that have been incurred subsequent to a given calendar year end 
we aggregate losses incurred for each of the three years after a given calendar year end and determine the percentage of losses to earned premium for that calendar year 
we calculate the ibnr reserve by multiplying the appropriate historical percentage of losses by the earned premium for the current year and each of the prior two calendar years 
our calculations are based on historical losses incurred by line of business and coverage type and are modified where appropriate for changes in premium rates 
we monitor the percentages for historical patterns and adjust our ibnr reserves as appropriate 
salvage and subrogation reserves are established in a similar manner to ibnr except that we track actual historical salvage and subrogation receipts as a percentage of loss incurred 
in addition  we establish lae reserves by tracking historical expenses as a percentage of incurred losses 
our financial management personnel calculate our financial statement loss and lae reserves independently from those amounts calculated by our actuaries 
our financial management personnel establish our financial statement loss and lae reserves primarily by reviewing historical loss and lae data  focusing mainly on payment data 
this method of using historical loss payments over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses assumes that the ratio of losses paid in one period to losses paid in an earlier period will remain consistent 
this method necessarily assumes that factors that have affected paid losses in the past  such as inflation or the effects of litigation  will remain consistent in the future 
although we review trends for inflation  severity and the effects of litigation  these factors have not caused us to materially modify our loss and lae reserves 
historical paid loss development methods do not use case reserves to estimate ultimate los ses and can be more reliable than the other methods that look to case reserves such as actuarial methods that use incurred losses in situations where there are significant changes in how case reserves are established by a company s claims adjusters 
however  historical paid loss development methods are more leveraged meaning that small changes in payments have a larger impact on estimates of ultimate losses than actuarial methods that use incurred losses because cumulative loss payments take much longer to equal the expected ultimate losses than cumulative incurred amounts 
in addition  and for similar reasons  historical paid loss development methods are often slow to react to situations when new or different factors arise than those that have affected paid losses in the past 
because of the nature of our business and the consistent manner in claims settlement  we believe the use of historical payment patterns provides us the most appropriate method for establishing our reserve 
we also review and compare the most recent loss frequency  severity  and payment data to historical trends in an attempt to determine if patterns are remaining consistent or not 
we believe they remain consistent 
we record our best estimate of the ultimate losses and lae that we will incur to settle all claims and ibnr at each reporting date  but the actual amount of such losses and lae cannot be known until all claims are settled 
our financial statement loss and lae reserves net of reinsurance prior to the effect of ceded insurance recoverable  based on our best estimate  were established at  for december  this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is no reasonably precise method  however  for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual development of reserves is affected by many factors  as noted above 
we utilize an actuarial calculation as a test of reasonableness of our financial statement loss and lae reserves which were calculated by financial management 
our actuaries calculate their estimate of our liability for loss and lae reserves using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques 
the reserving techniques employed by our actuaries include incurred loss development and paid loss development for all reviewed lines 
for voluntary personal automobile liability  two additional methods were used claim count times average severity and exposures times ultimate pure premium 
in estimating allocated lae alae reserves  our actuaries used two methods paid alae development and ratio of paid alae to paid loss development 
for unallocated lae ulae reserve  three methods were used paid ulae development  paid ulae to paid loss ratio development and calendar year paid ulae to paid loss and alae 
an average of these methods is calculated  whi ch is called the indicated ultimate loss 
the indicated ultimate loss is then subjected to actuarial judgment which considers other factors  such as the resulting ultimate loss ratio  loss trends  changes to business and the relative value of each of the different methods 
a selected ultimate loss amount is then determined 
using the criteria of actuarial standard of practice no 
 a reserve range is then calculated that the actuary judges to be reasonable based upon appropriate actuarial methods and judgment 
the actuarial methods utilized are considered standard for property and casualty companies with losses settling over a relatively short period of time  usually within to years short tail liability losses 
the same basic assumptions and methods were used at both december  and our aggregate actuarial estimate for the loss and lae reserves  on a consolidated basis and net of reinsurance recoverable  ranges from a low of  to a high of  as of december  and a low of  to a high of  at december  after taking into account all relevant factors  we believe that  based on existing information  the provision for losses and lae at december  is adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses and claims incurred as of that date 
however  loss reserves are estimates and are inherently uncertain  they do not and cannot represent an exact measure of the liability 
the ultimate liability may be greater or lower than established reserves 
if the ultimate payment is greater than or less than our estimated liability for losses and lae  we will incur additional expense or income  as appropriate  which may have a material impact on our results of operations 
as our business primarily involves losses with a short tailed liability  our loss and lae reserves have more predictable development patterns than other property and casualty insurers whose business involves losses with a longer tailed loss payment pattern 
as we base our estimate of loss and lae reserves primarily on historical payment experience  the following sensitivity analysis assumes that our historical payment experience was impacted by the stated percentages 
the factors which could cause the payment experience to change are not analyzed individually as these factors are imbedded in the historical information 
based upon historical results over the last five years  we show a redundancy for all five years  with a minimum redundancy of and a maximum redundancy of from the initially established reserves 
see page for an analysis of our historical loss and lae reserve development 
the following sensitivity analysis presents the pro forma effect of a and percentage point redundancy change in our loss and lae reserves prior to the effect of ceded reinsurance recoverable at december  hypothetical change in loss and lae reserve estimate loss and lae reserve estimate  net pro forma increase in net earnings pro forma percentage increase in stockholders equity no change decrease decrease net of income taxes at an assumed rate of 
the hypothetical changes noted above are based on historical experience 
conditions and trends that have affected development of reserves in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on the preceding table 
we believe that any additional payments due as a result of the inherent uncertainty of establishing loss and lae reserves as noted in the sensitivity analysis above would be adequately met by our normal operating cash flow 
the business we assume from car is a significant component of our loss and lae reserves 
our assumed car loss and lae reserves amounted to approximately of our loss and lae reserves at december  prior to the effect of ceded reinsurance recoverable 
car provides information to pool participants on a quarterly basis  one quarter in arrears 
car provides consolidated results  which consist of all companies ceded business into the pool  as well as information specific to our company 
car provides information by line of business on policy year and accident year bases 
this information consists of premiums written  unearned premium  earned premium  paid losses  case reserves  ibnr reserves  incurred losses  incurred loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses 
the starting point for car s determination of its loss and lae reserves is the separate loss and lae reserves that car member companies provide to car 
car then aggregates this informa tion  which is reviewed by car s loss reserve committee  comprised of actuaries from member companies 
this car actuarial committee establishes the total loss and lae reserves for a given period 
our share of these loss and lae reserves is derived by multiplying our participation ratio by the total car loss and lae reserves 
management utilizes the information provided by car to book the initial amount related to the pool 
the consolidated financial results produced by car are audited by independent public accountants and we rely on this audit for the incorporation of their reported results into our financial statements 
car assesses the integrity of premium and claim data submissions by member companies by periodically auditing those member companies 
our actuary also reviews the car actuarial committee s work along with total car and company loss results for reasonableness 
the quarterly reports that car provides to us are one quarter in arrears when we calculate this component of our financial statement loss and lae reserves  and therefore  it is necessary for us to make an estimate of the most recent quarter results for car 
in calculating this estimate we compare the car loss and lae reserve data with historical premium written and earned amounts from car 
we then utilize the estimated written and earned premiums from car for the most recent quarter to calculate losses  lae and underwriting expenses that would relate to that quarter  and then incorporate that information into our financial results 
car results are less predictable and therefore more susceptible to change than our loss reserves because they are comprised of individual ceded business from all car member companies which may or may not use similar reserving methodologies and ceding philosophies as we use 
based on the historical data of the five most recent accident years  car had redundancies and deficiencies within its accident years 
the deficiencies had a low of and a high of of the initial reserves  while the redundancies had a low of and a high of of the initial reserves 
these are the percentages utilized in our sensitivity analysis for our loss and lae reserves related to car at december  hypothetical change in loss and lae reserve estimate loss and lae reserve estimate  net pro forma increase decrease in net earnings pro forma percentage increase decrease in stockholders equity increase increase no change decrease decrease net of income taxes at an assumed rate of 
the hypothetical changes noted above are based on historical experience 
conditions and trends that have affected development of reserves in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on the preceding table 
investments and other than temporary impairments 
the carrying values of investments in fixed maturities  which include taxable and non taxable bonds  and investments in common and preferred stocks  are derived from market prices supplied by our investment custodian or  when no price is provided by the custodian  from a third party valuation 
fair market value of fixed maturities and equity securities is based on quoted market prices 
unrealized investment gains and losses on common and preferred stocks and fixed maturities  to the extent that there is no other than temporary impairment of value  are credited or charged  net of any tax effect  to a separate component of stockholders equity  known as net accumulated other comprehensive income loss  until realized 
we review all security holdings on a quarterly basis for potential other than temporary impairments due to declines in market value in accordance with gaap 
in general  unrealized losses resulting from an increase in interest rates will not necessarily lead to an other than temporary write down 
as part of this process  we consider any significant market decline in the context of the overall market and also in relation to the outlook for the specific issuer of the security and the issuer s industry 
each quarter  we review all securities whose market values have declined below book price 
from a quantitative standpoint  we review all securities that have declined more than below book price and have remained so for two consecutive quarters as potentially in need of a write down 
any other security that we view as impaired for a significant period of time is also a candidate for a write down  even if the percentage decline is less than 
in addition  w e perform the following quarterly impairment review of our portfolio we review all holdings with an unrealized loss of over  or a fair market value that is more than below cost 
we review all holdings with unrealized losses over  or a fair market value that is more than below cost  for securities at a continuous loss position period of to months 
we review all securities that have been at a continuous loss position for months or more 
we review both issue specific data and general market data for all perpetual preferred stocks that have been at a continuous loss position for over months 
generally  we consider all aaa aa rated us government securities with market values less than cost as temporarily impaired due to our intent and ability to hold these securities to full recovery 
we consider market activity between our quarter end date and earnings release date in our evaluation 
we will consider other than temporary the impairment of any security which we do not intend to hold to maturity or full recovery 
if a security is deemed other than temporarily impaired  we adjust the security s cost basis to market value through realized loss based on publicly available prices or  in the absence of such information  on a price supplied by a broker 
there is a risk that we may assess an other than temporary decline in market value as being temporary and  consequently  not charge the impairment to our earnings  which could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
accrued agents profit sharing 
in addition to state mandated minimum and other commissions on policies written  we pay certain of our agencies compensation in the form of profit sharing under five separate arrangements one for commerce and citation for their massachusetts agencies  another for commerce s new hampshire agencies  one for american commerce for its agencies  and  two for commerce west for its agencies 
each of these arrangements entitles qualifying agencies to share in our results based primarily on the underwriting profits of an individual agents business written with us 
our total obligation under these arrangements is reported on our consolidated balance sheet as accrued agents profit sharing 
for segment reporting  our profit sharing expenses are aligned by state  profit sharing expense for our agencies in massachusetts is included in our massachusetts segment s earnings  profit sharing expense for our agencies in states other than massachusetts is included in our other than massachusetts segment s earnings 
approximately of our total profit sharing expense in was for our massachusetts agencies under the commerce and citation arrangement 
because this one arrangement accounts for nearly all of our profit sharing expense  the following discussion relates only to the commerce and citation plan in massachusetts and excludes the other four profit sharing plans  the accounting for which we don t consider to be a critical accounting policy 
the arrangement utilizes a three year rolling plan  with one third of the agents profit or loss for each of the current and the two prior years calculations summed to a single amount 
this amount  if positive  is multiplied by a sliding scale profit sharing commission rate and paid to the agent in the second quarter of the following year 
we estimate our current year profit sharing expense each quarter 
our expense calculation at year end has one critical accounting estimate  as defined by the sec  which we refer to as the discount factors 
the discount factors represent our expected profit sharing payments for the second and third years following the current year s payment  net of attrition related to our agencies profitability and profit sharing eligibility 
we don t use a discount factor for the current year s payment because  subject to some final adjustments  our year end estimate of our next payment is usually reasonably close to the actual payment amount 
however  we know from experience that all of the agencies that are currently profitable  after the first and second years of each rolling three year cycle  will not remain profitable and be entitled to all of the profit sharing earned during those years 
therefore  we apply discount factors in our accrual calculation to the estimate d payment amounts for the latter two years to estimate this attrition in profit sharing eligibility 
we evaluate annually the appropriateness of these discount factors by considering our past experience and other prospective factors that may influence attrition in profit sharing eligibility  such as the pricing and regulatory environments in massachusetts  current agency experience data  projected results of car  and underwriting results 
some of our prospective assumptions that underlie pricing  regulatory  car  and other factors are uncertain when we are performing our evaluation 
in  we increased our discount factors primarily because our underwriting results continued to be favorable and we expect less future attrition as a result 
we believe the change is warranted despite the fact that we are currently in a soft market with significant premium rate decreases in massachusetts 
we believe that although the and premium rate reductions scheduled for the next months in massachusetts will reduce the profitability of our agencies in the st ate  the reductions should not cause a significant number of agencies who are currently profitable under our arrangement to become unprofitable in  although we expect the number to grow in two years out 
by increasing our discount factors in  we increased our profit sharing expense commerce and citation only in by approximately  which equates to a reduction in diluted eps of approximately 
the december  factors are payable in one year and payable in two years 
although the discount factors we used in our profit sharing estimate resulted from a comprehensive evaluation  our actual future payment results may not agree with these factors due to the uncertainties underlying certain assumptions we had to make 
any expense overage or shortfall will be recognized in our earnings in subsequent years along with our profit sharing estimates for those years 
the following table quantifies what the financial effect would have been to our and profit sharing expense commerce and citation only  consolidated net earnings after taxes  and diluted eps had our discount factors been basis points higher and lower

massachusetts personal automobile insurance overview 
we have been the largest writer of personal property and casualty insurance in massachusetts in terms of market share of direct premiums written since our estimated share of the massachusetts personal automobile market increased to for the year through november   significantly exceeding our two nearest competitors  safety insurance group  inc and arbella insurance group  who maintained an estimated and market shares  respectively 
in massachusetts  private passenger automobile insurance is subject to extensive regulation 
owners of automobiles are generally required to demonstrate certain minimum automobile insurance coverages as a prerequisite to registering any automobile 
with very limited exceptions  private passenger automobile insurers are required by law to issue a policy to any applicant seeking to obtain such coverages  commonly known as the take all comers requirement 
marketing and underwriting strategies for companies operating in massachusetts are limited by maximum premium rates and minimum agency commission levels for personal automobile insurance  both of which are mandated by the commissioner 
changes in premium rates 
in each of the last three years  the commissioner approved an average mandated massachusetts personal automobile insurance premium rate decrease 
the commissioner approved average decreases of for the one year period beginning april  and for the fifteen months beginning january  coinciding with the and rate decisions  the commissioner also approved commissions agents receive for selling private passenger automobile insurance 
the commissioner approved no change in commission dollars for and a increase for the following table shows the state mandated average rate change  the actual average written premium change per exposure and our average written premium change per exposure as estimated for and for the three previous years in massachusetts 
year state mandated average rate change actual state average written premium change per exposure commerce average written premium change per exposure na estimated for commerce average written premium change per exposure 
based on massachusetts division of insurance filings 
na data is currently unavailable 
although mandated average personal automobile premium rates decreased in  our average written premium per exposure decreased only 
we believe that the smaller decrease for as compared to the commissioner s state mandated average rate resulted primarily from the fact that our mix of personal automobile coverage differs from that of the industry  and changes to our distribution of risks by class  territory and coverage  including changes resulting from the purchase of new  more expensive automobiles  which were not factored into the commissioner s rate decrease 
the actual state average written premium change per exposure represents the change in the average premium paid by drivers in massachusetts  as opposed to the state mandated average rate change 
as can be seen above  our average written premium change per exposure corresponds more closely to the actual state average written premium change 
the primary reason for this is that both take into account newer vehicles  as compared to the state mandated average rate change  which does not 
the commissioner approved an decrease in state mandated average personal automobile insurance premium rate for the one year period ending april  management estimates that this will translate into a decline in the average written premium per exposure for the upcoming year 
we estimate the net pre tax impact of the decrease in our average written premium per exposure to be approximately  the majority of the impact will occur during the last quarter of and the first quarter of as premiums for policies with effective dates become earned 
affinity group marketing 
since  we have been a leader in affinity group marketing in massachusetts  through agreements with the three american automobile association clubs operating in massachusetts  offering discounts on private passenger automobile insurance to the clubs members who reside in the state 
a discount was approved by the commissioner for policies effective april  this same discount existed in through april  based on information provided to us by the aaa clubs operating in massachusetts  we believe that membership in these clubs represents approximately one third of the massachusetts motoring public 
the following table presents total direct premiums written attributable to the aaa clubs group business in massachusetts for the years ended december total aaa massachusetts direct premiums written percentage of total direct premiums written percentage of massachusetts direct personal automobile premiums written total aaa massachusetts exposures percentage of massachusetts exposures the decreasing percentages since are attributed to a higher rate of increase in non affinity group business 
of the total massachusetts automobile exposures written through the aaa affinity group program by us in  approximately were written through insurance agencies owned by the aaa clubs of our total massachusetts automobile exposures 
the remaining of the aaa group program was written through our network of independent agents 
our performance measures we evaluate our operations by monitoring key measures of growth and profitability 
we measure our growth by examining our direct premiums written as well as increases in exposures and policies 
we generally measure our operating results in accordance with gaap by examining our net earnings  return on equity roe  and our loss and lae  underwriting expense and combined ratios on a consolidated basis 
our key measures include diluted earnings per share 
diluted earnings per share is net earnings divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted by the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding had potentially dilutive common shares been issued and reduced by the number of common shares we could have purchased from the proceeds of those potentially dilutive shares 
return on equity 
return on equity is net earnings divided by stockholders equity at the beginning of the period 
direct premiums written 
direct premiums written is the sum of the total policy premiums  net of cancellations  associated with policies underwritten and issued by our insurance subsidiaries 
we use direct premiums written  which includes premiums that we cede to car and other reinsurers  as a measure of the underlying growth of our insurance business from period to period 
direct earned premiums 
direct earned premiums are the portion of direct premiums written over the preceding twelve month period equal to the expired portion of policies and recognized as revenue during an accounting period 
net investment income 
net investment income represents earnings on our investment portfolio less expenses 
we rely on after tax investment income as a significant source of net earnings although we generally achieve a combined ratio see below of less than 
loss and lae ratio 
the loss and lae ratio is the percentage of losses and loss adjustment expenses including corporate expenses incurred to earned premiums 
we calculate this ratio net of our reinsurance recoveries 
we use this ratio as a measure of the overall underwriting profitability of the insurance business we write and to assess the adequacy of our pricing 
underwriting expense ratio 
the underwriting expense ratio is the percentage of underwriting expenses including corporate expenses incurred to net premiums written 
underwriting expenses are the aggregate of policy acquisition costs  including commissions  and the portion of administrative  general and other expenses attributable to underwriting operations 
in addition  underwriting expenses are adjusted for any change in deferred acquisition costs 
combined ratio 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss and lae ratio and the underwriting expense ratio and measures a company s overall underwriting profit 
if the combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income  and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient 
we use the combined ratio in evaluating our overall underwriting profitability and for comparing our profitability to that of our competitors 
results of operations our key operating measures for the years ended december follow dollars in millions  except earnings per share diluted earnings per share return on equity direct premiums written direct earned premiums net investment income loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio year ended compared to year ended the decrease in earnings in over resulted primarily from an increase in our combined ratio in the increase in the combined ratio can be attributed to an increase in the underwriting ratio  partially offset by a decline in the loss ratio 
also impacting net earnings was a  increase in net investment income partially offset by a  decline in net realized investment gains 
we attribute the improvement in the loss ratio to several factors decreases in the current year automobile bodily injury and physical damage claims frequencies  continued improvement in the results from car due to fewer industry wide cessions to car coupled with lower loss ratio on current year car business  partially offset by reduced favorable voluntary reserve development compared to the increase in the underwriting ratio resulted primarily from reduced ceded reinsurance commissions  as a result of the termination of our other than automobile quota share agreement at june  premium results for a detailed breakdown on direct premiums written and earned  see note p segment information in notes to consolidated financial statements 
massachusetts segment we experienced a slight decline in direct premiums written in the massachusetts segment of  with declines in our personal automobile business outweighing growth in homeowners and commercial automobile business 
the personal automobile business decline was a result of a decline in average written premium per written exposure partially offset by a increase in the number of written exposures 
commerce continues to increase its market share in both the voluntary and erp markets 
approximately of the increase in written exposures resulted from new erps and the remaining from continuing agents 
our year to date homeowners growth was the result of a increase in average premium per policy partially offset by a decrease in the number of policies written 
our year to date commercial automobile growth was the result of a increase in average premium per policy combined with a increase in policies written 
other than massachusetts segment total direct written premiums for the other than massachusetts segment declined  or 
the personal automobile decline accounted for the majority of this decrease  primarily as the result of the continued decline in premiums in arizona due to the loss of aaa arizona s affinity business in direct written premiums from personal automobile policies in arizona declined  or  primarily due to a decline in policies 
we believe arizona business volumes have now stabilized 
american commerce and commerce west will continue to write business in arizona  however  acic no longer markets its products through aaa arizona 
also contributing to the decline in personal automobile direct written premium were a drop in ohio  a decline in idaho and a drop in indiana 
partially offsetting these declines were increases in oregon  washington and oklahoma 
in general  we are lowering rates in states in which we write business in response to competitive pressures as a result of a soft market 
commercial automobile premiums decreased while homeowners increased by 
other lines increased  primarily due to  of direct premiums from ani  resulting from american commerce becoming a direct writer of ani business 
segment results massachusetts segment revenue increased  or  over the prior year primarily due to increases in earned premium and net investment income 
the increase in earned premium resulted from the combination of the earning of s increased personal automobile written premium as well as the earning of the returned unearned premium from the termination of our other than automobile quota share agreement 
net investment income increased as both outstanding invested assets and the yield on those assets increased 
earnings increased  or  over the prior year primarily due to the increases in revenue previously discussed  partially offset by an increased combined ratio 
the combined ratio increased due to the factors discussed for the company as a whole 
other than massachusetts segment revenues declined  or  over the prior year principally due to declining earned premium as written premium has declined in each of the last two years  as previously discussed 
increases in net investment income were offset by declines in realized investment gains 
earnings declined  or  over the previous year due to the previously mentioned revenue declines combined with an increased combined ratio 
the increased combined ratio resulted from the same factors for the company as a whole 
net investment income our net investment income for the year ended increased  or compared to net investment income is affected by the composition of our investment portfolio and yields on those investments 
the composition of our investment portfolio  at cost  at december follows of of total total fixed maturities a preferred stocks common stocks preferred stock mutual funds mortgages and collateral notes short term investments cash and cash equivalents other investments total investments and cash a fixed maturities include mortgage backed bonds  corporate bonds  us treasury bonds and notes and tax exempt state and municipal bonds

the increase in invested assets is primarily attributable to increased operating cash flows 
the increase in yields corresponds with the increase in duration of our fixed maturity portfolio which rose to years at december  from years a year earlier 
the increased yield is primarily attributable to the government bond and preferred stock segments  where pre tax yields increased and basis points  respectively

losses and loss adjustment expenses our loss ratio declined to for from the prior year 
the improvement was the result of several factors  including improved current year results  and a decrease in the current year personal and commercial automobile bodily injury and physical damage claim frequency 
a reconciliation of beginning and ending reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for the years ended december  net of reinsurance deductions from all reinsurers including car  follows incurred losses and lae provision for insured events of the current year decrease in provision for insured events of prior years total incurred losses and lae payments losses and lae attributable to insured events of the current year losses and lae attributable to insured events of prior years total payments change in loss and lae reserves during the year loss and lae reserves prior to the effect of ceded reinsurance recoverable  beginning of year loss and lae reserves prior to the effect of ceded reinsurance recoverable  end of year ceded reinsurance recoverable loss and lae reserves  end of year as a result of changes in estimates of insured events in prior years  the provision for loss and lae decreased  for the year ended and  for the year ended the favorable development is due primarily to lower than anticipated losses related to the personal automobile liability 
conditions and trends that have affected development in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based upon these developments 
the amounts we will ultimately incur from loss and loss adjustment expenses could differ materially in the near term from the amounts recorded 
approximately  in personal automobile liability redundancies developed for the year ended  with of this amount coming from the  and accident years 
the primary reason for the redundancies in this area is that claim severity developed better than we anticipated  coupled with significant redundancies from car  which approximated of the total automobile liability redundancy 
automobile physical damage had approximately  in redundancies all related to the accident year  which were offset by prior period deficiencies 
redundancies related to were approximately  of which car accounted for 
partially offsetting these redundancies was a  deficiency in commercial automobile business  primarily related to car for the accident year  and a deficiency in homeowners business 
various redundancies and deficiencies for the other lines of business and accident years combined for the remaining net redundancy of approximately management considers many factors  as disclosed in the critical accounting policies section of this report  in establishing its best estimate for loss and lae reserves 
we believe that our loss and lae reserve estimate is a reasonable assessment of the ultimate future payment amounts necessary to settle all of our insured losses incurred as of december  in addition  we believe the pro forma analysis presented under the critical accounting policies is a reasonable depiction of our sensitivity related to our estimate  based on our reserving methodology and the short tail nature of the business that we write 
however  the ultimate liability may be greater or less than the established reserves for losses and lae 
if the ultimate payments are greater or less than our estimated liability for losses and lae  we will either incur additional or less expenses  respectively  in future periods which may have a material effect on our future results of operations 
policy acquisition costs our underwriting ratio increased to for from in the prior year  primarily as a result of reduced ceded reinsurance commissions 
this reduction resulted from the termination of our other than automobile quota share agreement 
also contributing to the increase were higher accrued agents profit sharing and higher policy year mandated massachusetts personal automobile commission rates  as well as an increase in our assessment from the massachusetts insurance insolvency fund 
see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
the increase in agents profit sharing is due to improved underwriting results versus the previous year 
other the market price for our common stock and our financial results directly affects our expense related to stock options  book value awards bvas and incentive awards ias  respectively 
our stock option expense represents options granted to both employees and american commerce agents 
the majority of this expense is related to options granted to american commerce agents 
an increase in the market value of our stock will increase the expense we recognize for options 
similarly  an increase in our net income will increase the value of  and therefore the expense we recognize for  outstanding bvas and ias 
we record these expenses in three separate line items on our income statement losses and loss adjustment expenses  policy acquisition costs and net investment income 
see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
the stock option  bva and ia expenses recorded in each line item for the years ended december follow losses and loss adjustment expenses policy acquisition costs net investment income total stock option  bva and ia expenses income taxes our overall effective tax rate for the year ended was as compared to for in both years  our effective rate was lower than the statutory rate of primarily due to tax exempt interest and the corporate dividends received deduction 
our effective tax rate decreased in due to a slightly higher amount of the corporate dividends received deduction and lower profits at the rate

the revised rules did not change our accounting for bvas  ias and the stock options we award under the american commerce agents option plan 
year ended compared to year ended the significant increase in earnings in over was primarily due to the decrease in our loss ratio 
we attribute the improvement in our loss ratio to several factors improved current year results and continued favorable prior years loss development from car  an increase in average earned premium revenue per automobile see discussion regarding premium results  and a decrease in the current year personal and commercial automobile bodily injury claim frequency 
these items were partially offset by reduced favorable voluntary loss reserve development compared to the effect of our improved loss ratio on earnings was partially offset by the increase in our underwriting ratio 
this increase was driven by a significant increase in our agents profit sharing expense in and slightly higher policy year mandated massachusetts personal automobile commission rates  both partially offset by a decrease in our assessment from the massachusetts insurance insolvency fund 
the increase in agents profit sharing expense is the result of improved underwriting results in versus premium results for a detailed breakdown on direct premiums written and earned  see note p segment information in notes to consolidated financial statements 
massachusetts segment we experienced growth in direct premiums written in the massachusetts segment of  with increases in our personal automobile and homeowners lines of business 
growth in personal automobile business accounted for approximately of the segment s increase 
personal automobile business growth was a result of a increase in the number of written exposures coupled with a increase in average written premium per written exposure 
the agents assigned to us by car accounted for of the written exposure increase 
we believe that voluntary agents are currently very cautious in moving books of business between carriers due to the uncertainties created by car reform proposals 
our year to date homeowners growth was from a increase in average premium per policy partially offset by a decrease in the number of policies written 
our year to date commercial automobile decline was from a decrease in average premium per policy partially offset by a increase in policies written 
average premium per policy has declined due to more competitive pricing in a softening market 
other than massachusetts segment total direct written premiums for the other than massachusetts segment declined  or 
the personal automobile decline accounted for the majority of this decrease  primarily as the result of the decline in premiums in arizona due to the loss of aaa arizona s affinity business 
direct written premiums from personal automobile policies in arizona declined  or  and policies in force declined 
we project an additional decline of  or  during american commerce and commerce west will continue to write business in arizona  however  acic will no longer market its products through aaa arizona 
in general  we are lowering rates in states in which we write business in response to competitive pressures 
commercial automobile premiums increased over while homeowners and other lines were basically unchanged 
the increase in the commercial automobile category primarily resulted from an increase in the number of policies in force at commerce west 
net investment income our net investment income for the year ended increased  or compared to net investment income is affected by the composition of our investment portfolio and yields on those investments 
the composition of our investment portfolio  at cost  at december follows of of total total fixed maturities a preferred stocks common stocks preferred stock mutual funds mortgages and collateral notes cash and cash equivalents other investments total investments a fixed maturities include mortgage backed bonds  corporate bonds  us treasury bonds and notes and tax exempt state and municipal bonds 
key measures of net investment income for the years ended december follow years ended investment return average month end investments at cost net investment income before tax net investment income after tax net investment income as a percentage of average net investments at cost net investment income after tax as a percentage of average net investments at cost the increase in our net investment income in was primarily due to increased invested assets partially offset by lower overall yields 
the increase in invested assets is primarily attributable to increased operating cash flows 
the decrease in yields corresponds with the decline in duration of our fixed maturity portfolio in which we sold higher yielding investment securities 
this is particularly true in the corporate and municipal bonds segments  where pre tax yields declined and basis points  respectively 
realized investment gains and losses net realized investment gains losses for the years ended december follow change transaction net gains losses fixed maturity securities equity securities venture capital funds other investments transaction net gains other than temporary impairment losses fixed maturity securities equity securities total other than temporary impairment losses equity in earnings of closed end preferred stock mutual funds net realized investment gains included in net earnings total realized gains were relatively flat from as compared to impairment losses decreased by  but were offset by a  decline in transaction gains and a  decline in the equity in earnings of the closed end preferred stock mutual funds 
once again in  we were able to realize significant investment gains in long duration municipal bonds and asset backed investments 
we maintain the flexibility to realize capital gains when we feel it is a benefit for our long term  after tax return 
losses and loss adjustment expenses our loss ratio declined to for from the prior year 
the improvement was the result of several factors  including improved current year results and continued favorable prior years loss development from car  an increase in average earned premium revenue per automobile  and a decrease in the current year personal and commercial automobile bodily injury claim frequency 
redundancies related to prior years for car private passenger auto liability accounted for approximately one half of the decrease in the loss ratio from these items were partially offset by reduced favorable voluntary loss reserve development compared to a reconciliation of beginning and ending reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for the years ended december  net of reinsurance deductions from all reinsurers including car  follows incurred losses and lae provision for insured events of the current year decrease in provision for insured events of prior years total incurred losses and lae payments losses and lae attributable to insured events of the current year losses and lae attributable to insured events of prior years total payments change in loss and lae reserves during the year loss and lae reserves prior to the effect of ceded reinsurance recoverable  beginning of year loss and lae reserves prior to the effect of ceded reinsurance recoverable  end of year ceded reinsurance recoverable loss and lae reserves  end of year as a result of changes in estimates of insured events in prior years  the provision for loss and lae decreased  for the year ended and  for the year ended the favorable development is due primarily to lower than anticipated losses related to the personal automobile liability  the automobile physical damage and the commercial multiple peril lines of business 
conditions and trends that have affected development in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based upon these developments 
the amounts we will ultimately incur from loss and loss adjustment expenses could differ materially in the near term from the amounts recorded 
approximately  in personal automobile liability redundancies developed for the year ended  with of this amount coming from the  and accident years 
the primary reason for the redundancies in this area is that claim severity developed better than we anticipated  coupled with significant redundancies from car  which accounted for approximately of the total automobile liability redundancy 
automobile physical damage had approximately  in redundancies chiefly related to the accident year  approximately of which was related to car 
in  we also experienced redundancies of  for the commercial multiple peril line of business  of which related to the accident year 
partially offsetting these redundancies was a  deficiency in commercial automobile business  primarily related to car for the accident year 
various redundancies and deficiencies for the other lines of business and accident y ears combined for the remaining net redundancy of approximately  policy acquisition costs our underwriting ratio increased to for from in the prior year  primarily as a result of significantly higher accrued agents profit sharing and slightly higher policy year mandated massachusetts personal automobile commission rates  both partially offset by a decrease in our assessment from the massachusetts insurance insolvency fund 
in addition to the increase in agents profit sharing expense in  policy acquisition cost increases are also due to our premium growth 
the increase in agents profit sharing is due to improved underwriting results versus the previous year 
premium growth results in additional expense in commission  premium tax  and other variable costs 
partially offsetting these increases was a decline in stock option  bva and ia expense 
other the market price for our common stock and our financial results directly affects our expense related to stock options  bvas and ias  respectively 
we record these expenses in three separate line items on our income statement losses and loss adjustment expenses  policy acquisition costs and net investment income 
the stock option  bva and ia expenses recorded in each line item for the years ended december follow losses and loss adjustment expenses policy acquisition costs net investment income total stock option  bva and ia expenses income taxes our overall effective tax rate for the year ended was as compared to for in both years  our effective rate was lower than the statutory rate of primarily due to tax exempt interest and the corporate dividends received deduction 
our effective tax rate increased in due to improved underwriting results which are taxed at 
financial condition our financial condition improved significantly in our stockholders equity per share increased from at december  to at december  our ratio of total liabilities to stockholders equity decreased percentage points at december  from the prior year end 
this decrease is due to a increase in equity combined with a decline in total liabilities 
the increase in equity during resulted primarily from current year earnings and appreciation in value of available for sale securities  partially offset by dividends paid and common stock repurchased 
total liabilities decreased chiefly as a result of declines in unpaid losses and lae and accrued expenses partially offset by increased accrued agents profit sharing 
total assets increased  or  versus the prior year end 
predictably  as they comprise approximately of total assets  investment growth represented the majority of the increase 
investments increased  or  from operating cash flows  retained net earnings and from market value appreciation 
we continue to maintain our cash and fixed maturity investments at levels to both service our liabilities and optimize after tax returns 
amounts due from reinsurers declined due to the termination of our other than automobile quota share agreement

during the second quarter of  we entered into an agreement to fund a commercial loan participation of  as of december    of this commitment has been funded and is included in other investments on the consolidated balance sheet 
the remaining commitment will be funded through ordinary operating cash flows over the next two years 
we have commitments in two venture capital fund investments 
these investments are made in limited partnerships and our exposure to loss is limited to our actual investment 
one limited partnership investment required a commitment by us to invest up to  into the partnership 
as of december   we invested  into the partnership 
the partnership was formed to operate as an investment fund principally for the purpose of making investments primarily in equity  equity related and other securities issued in expansion financing  start ups  buy outs and recapitalization transactions relating to companies in the areas of insurance  financial services  e commerce  healthcare  and related businesses  including  without limitation  service and technology enterprises supporting such businesses 
the other limited partnership interest required a commitment by us to invest up to  into the partnership 
as of december   we invested  into the partnership 
the partnership was formed to operate as an investment fund principally for the purpose of making investments in equity and equity related securities of companies operating in the area of insurance distribution and distribution related activities 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity management allows us to meet our cash needs at a reasonable cost under various operating environments 
liquidity is actively managed and reviewed in order to maintain stable  cost effective funding to meet our operating needs 
liquidity comes from a variety of sources such as cash flow from operating activities and borrowing capacity 
management believes its current liquidity exceeds its operational requirements as of december  the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from insurance premiums  net investment income  premium finance and service fees and the maturing and sale of investments 
the primary uses of our liquidity are payment of policy claims  operating costs  interest on our senior notes  purchases of investment securities and treasury stock  and payment of dividends to our stockholders 
we believe our capital resources are sufficient toward meeting our short and long term liquidity needs 
in april  commerce insurance became a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb of boston  providing commerce insurance with a significant source of liquidity 
the fhlb of boston  which is one of regional fhlbs  serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region 
the fhlb of boston makes loans  which are referred to as advances  to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by its board of directors 
these policies and procedures are subject to the regulation and oversight of the federal housing finance board 
all advances from the fhlb of boston to commerce insurance are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the fhlb 
we estimate that fhlb membership provides commerce insurance with the capacity to borrow approximately  from the fhlb of boston 
we have not borrowed from the fhlb 
the primary source of liquidity for the commerce group parent company only is the payment of dividends from its subsidiaries 
its main subsidiary  chi  is dependent upon dividends from our insurance subsidiaries 
the payment of dividends from insurance companies is regulated and limited under the laws of massachusetts  ohio and california 
see payment of dividends within the regulations section of item business 
we expect to pay significantly more for agent profit sharing in than we paid in we paid approximately  for agent profit sharing in the second quarter of due to our improved underwriting results during  we estimate paying approximately  in the second quarter of industry and regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to statutory policyholders surplus should not exceed to 
the following table presents  on a consolidated basis  our net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio for the year ended net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio to to to market risk interest rate sensitivity and equity price risk the primary focus of our investment objectives continues to be maximizing after tax investment income through investing primarily in high quality diversified fixed maturity investments structured to maximize after tax investment income while minimizing risk 
we generally invest in securities with maturities intended to provide adequate cash flow to pay claims and meet other operating needs without the forced sale of investments 
when the appropriate opportunity arises  we will recognize investment gains to increase after tax total return 
we held no derivatives  emerging market securities or hedge funds at december  and in conducting investing activities  we are subject to  and assume  market risk 
market risk is the risk of an adverse financial impact from changes in interest rates and market prices 
the level of risk assumed by us is a function of our overall objectives  liquidity needs and market volatility 
we manage our market risk by focusing on higher quality equity and fixed maturity investments  by periodically monitoring the credit strength of companies in which investments are made  by limiting exposure in any one investment and by monitoring the quality of the investment portfolio taking into account  among other factors  credit ratings assigned by recognized rating organizations 
of our bonds and preferred stocks  of the market value was rated in either of the two highest quality categories provided by the naic as of december   as compared to at december  although we have significant holdings of various closed end preferred stock mutual funds  these funds are comprised primarily of preferred and common stocks traded on national stock exchanges  thus limiting exposure to any one obligor 
interest rate sensitivity 
as part of our investing activities  we assume positions in fixed maturity  equity  short term and cash equivalents markets 
therefore  we are exposed to the impacts of changes in the market value of investments resulting from fluctuations in interest rates 
we estimate our exposure to interest rate changes and equity price risk using sensitivity analysis 
the interest rate impact is defined as the effect of a hypothetical interest rate change of plus or minus or basis points on the market value of fixed maturities and preferred stocks 
changes in interest rates would result in unrealized gains or losses in the market value of the fixed maturity and preferred stock portfolio due to differences between current market rates and the stated rates for these investments 
the following table summarizes our interest rate risk  based on the results of the sensitivity analysis at december  and the table also reflects the changes in market value and stockholders equity that would be attributable to realized investment gains losses that we would recognize under the equity method of accounting with respect to the change in the net asset value of the mutual funds in which we own or more of the shares outstanding 
see critical accounting estimates investments and other than temporary impairments 
hypothetical change in interest rates estimated market value of fixed maturity and preferred stock investments estimated increase decrease in market value hypothetical percentage increase decrease in stockholders equity december  basis point increase basis point increase no change basis point decrease basis point decrease december  basis point increase basis point increase no change basis point decrease basis point decrease net of income taxes at an assumed rate of 
our fixed maturity portfolio s weighted average duration which includes all fixed maturities and preferred stocks as of december  and was years and years  respectively 
the duration of a security is the time weighted present value of the security s expected cash flows and is used to measure a security s price sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
the duration reflects industry prepayment assumptions 
the analytic systems we used to calculate the above duration data utilize optional call dates and sinking fund requirements and assume a non static prepayment pattern in deriving these averages 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions such as the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  reinvestment and replacement of asset and liability cash flows and other assumptions 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic conditions  we cannot provide any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that management might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
equity price risk 
the equity price risk is defined as a hypothetical change of plus or minus in the carrying value of common stocks 
this total includes common stocks at market value and those closed end preferred stock mutual funds carried at equity value 
the following table summarizes our equity price risk  based on the results of the sensitivity analysis at december  and hypothetical change in market price carrying value of common equity investments increase decrease in carrying value hypothetical percentage increase decrease in stockholders equity december  price increase price increase no change price decrease price decrease december  price increase price increase no change price decrease price decrease net of income taxes at an assumed rate of 
effects of inflation and recession we generally are unable to recover the costs of inflation in our personal automobile insurance line since the premiums charged for personal automobile insurance in massachusetts  our principal business segment  are subject to state regulation 
additionally  the premium rates that we charge for personal automobile insurance in massachusetts are adjusted by the commissioner generally at annual intervals 
such annual adjustments in premium rates may lag behind related cost increases 
economic recessions can have an impact upon us  primarily through the policyholder s election to decrease non compulsory coverages afforded by the policy and decreased driving  each of which tends to decrease claims 
to the extent inflation and economic recession influence yields on investments  we are also affected 
as each of these environments affect current market rates of return  previously committed investments may rise or decline in value depending on the type and maturity of investment 
inflation and recession must also be considered by us in the creation and review of loss and lae reserves since portions of these reserves are expected to be paid over extended periods of time 
the anticipated effect of economic conditions is implicitly considered when estimating liabilities for losses and lae 
the importance of continually adjusting reserves is even more pronounced in periods of changing economic circumstances
