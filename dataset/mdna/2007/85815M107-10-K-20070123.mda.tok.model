the newly constituted management team is committed to returning the company to profitability and is focused on making the necessary changes to meet the goals and objectives

goodwill impairment as a result of the management changes and the significant decrease in the company s public market capitalization  the company determined a triggering event had occurred under sfas in the third quarter of fiscal as a result  management re assessed the recoverability of goodwill carried on its financial statements and determined its goodwill and other intangible assets were impaired 
consequently  the company recognized an impairment loss of approximately  in the third quarter of fiscal in order to write down the carrying value of its goodwill to its estimated implied fair value 
the fair value of the company s single reporting unit was estimated after considering the company s market capitalization and other market based valuation approaches  in addition to analyzing the expected present value of future cash flows

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments  estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable  and evaluated them on an on going basis to ensure they remained reasonable under current conditions 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  complex and or subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with security and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  corrected copy sab 
generally  sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   we have adopted emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
issued in december by the financial accounting standards board fasb  eitf addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
this issue addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
this issue does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria 
in the event the company enters into a multiple element arrangement and there are undelivered elements as of the balance sheet date  we assess whether the elements are separable and have determinable fair value in determining the amount of revenue to record 
beginning in may   we began to recognize revenue associated with the resale of maintenance contracts on a net basis in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf  and interpretations thereof 
for comparative purposes  product revenue and cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years  and have been reclassified to reflect the effect of recording the resale of maintenance contracts on a net basis in those prior years 
we derive our revenue from the following sources product revenue  information technology support services  software license as a reseller and support revenue and software training and implementation revenue 
for product sales where title transfers upon shipment and risk of loss transfers to the customer  we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment 
for product sales where title and risk of loss transfers upon destination  we generally recognize revenue when products reach their destination 
revenue from hardware leased to customers under operating lease arrangements is recognized over the contract term 
when product and installation services that are not essential to the functionality of the product are sold as part of a bundled agreement  the fair value of the installation services  based on the price charged for the services when sold separately  is deferred and recognized when the services are performed 
the products sold are generally covered by a warranty ranging from one to three years 
we accrue an estimated warranty reserve in the period of sale to provide for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
for services revenue under time and material contracts  we recognize revenue as services are provided based on the hours of service at stated contractual rates 
we are also a value added solution provider for certain software products 
when resold software licenses and related maintenance  customization  and training services are all provided together to an individual customer  we recognize revenue for the arrangement after we have delivered the software license and the customer has approved all implementation and training services provided 
in instances where we only resell the software license and maintenance to the customer  we recognize revenue after the customer has acknowledged and accepted delivery of the software 
the software manufacturer is responsible for providing software maintenance 
accordingly  revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized upon delivery or acceptance  as we have no future obligation to provide the maintenance services and no right of return exists 
we incur shipping and handling costs  which are recorded in cost of revenues 
deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
this generally results from certain customer contracts  isv releases  warranties  hardware maintenance and support  and consulting services 
the deferred revenue associated with customer contracts and isv releases represents payments received for milestones achieved prior to recognition of revenue 
this revenue will be recognized as products are shipped 
revenues from warranties and hardware maintenance and support are recognized ratably over the service term selected by the customer 
deferred service revenues from consulting are recognized as the services are performed 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 we regularly assess the continuing value of goodwill to measure for possible impairment 
goodwill represents the unamortized excess of the cost of acquiring subsidiary companies over the fair values of such companies net tangible assets and other identifiable intangible assets at the date of acquisition 
as a result of the events described in note management change  restructuring and operations  the changes in management of the company and the significant decrease in our public market capitalization  we determined a triggering event had occurred under sfas no 
in the third quarter of fiscal as a result  we re assessed the recoverability of goodwill carried on our financial statements and determined our goodwill and other intangible assets were fully impaired 
consequently  we recognized an impairment loss of approximately  in the third quarter of fiscal in order to write down the carrying value of our goodwill to the estimated fair value 
the fair value of our single reporting unit was estimated after considering our market capitalization and other market based valuation approaches  in addition to analyzing the expected present value of future cash flows 
other intangibles related to the asgard acquisition were being amortized on a straight line basis using a three year life 
equity based compensation we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r on november  issued in december by the fasb  sfas no 
r requires that the fair value compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized over the employee s requisite service period 
the fair value of the stock options and employee stock purchase plan espp awards was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections in adopting and implementing sfas no 
r  including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected to use the straight line method for amortizing its stock option and espp awards 
we adopted the modified prospective transition method as provided by sfas no 
r and compensation costs for all awards granted after the date of adoption and the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding are measured at their estimated fair value 
prior to november   we accounted for employee stock option grants using the intrinsic method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and accordingly associated compensation expense  if any  was measured as the excess of the underlying stock price over the exercise price on the date of grant 
we also complied with the disclosure option of fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation  and fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure and made pro forma footnote disclosures 
pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements were estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of certain assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established  as necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets an amount expected to be realized in future periods 
we determine our valuation allowance pursuant to the provisions of fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence including past operating results and forecasts of future taxable income 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we adjusted our valuation allowance to fully reserve for all deferred tax assets  which caused us to recognize income tax expense of  in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance as of october   we considered  in particular  our forecasted taxable income for the upcoming fiscal year  current backlog of orders  including those recently received  and other significant opportunities currently in our sales and marketing pipeline with a high probability of generating revenues 
based upon this review  we have continued to fully reserve for all deferred tax assets as of october  inventory inventory consists of materials and components used in the assembly of our products or maintained to support maintenance and warranty obligations and are stated at the lower of cost or market using actual costs on a first in  first out basis 
we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and actual cost for each product  including purchased components  subassemblies and finished goods 
we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand 
finished goods are reported as inventory until the point of title transfer to the customer 
generally  title transfer is documented in the terms of sale 
when the terms of sale do not specify  we assume title transfers when it completes physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail 
we periodically evaluate our inventory obsolescence reserve to ensure inventory is recorded at its net realizable value 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including manufacturing raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period 
a reserve is maintained for obsolete or excess inventory based upon management s estimated usage requirements for the next or months and the length of time a particular part or component has been on hand in our inventories 
inherent in these estimates are our forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  technological and or market obsolescence and possible alternative uses 
if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
warranty typically  the sale of our specialized servers includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system 
we offer warranties for our systems that typically cover a period of one to three years that commences upon shipment of the system to the customer 
when appropriate  we record a reserve for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition 
the amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity 
all actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to the established reserves 
actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system by system basis  and may differ from our original estimates 
while the company periodically monitors the performance and cost of warranty activities  if actual costs incurred are different than its estimates  we may recognize adjustments to the reserve in the period in which those differences arise or are identified 
in addition to the provision of standard warranties  we offer customer paid extended warranty services 
revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
segment reporting fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas no 
 establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments 
operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision maker  or decision making group  in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
sfas no 
also establishes a quantitative threshold  whereby an enterprise should report separately information about an operating segment if its reported revenue is percent or more of the combined revenue of all reported operating segments 
our company is organized on the basis of products and services 
however  we do not evaluate the performance of our operating components and units based on earnings 
our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer 
while the chief executive officer is apprised of a variety of financial metrics and information  the chief executive officer makes decisions regarding how to allocate resources and assess performance based on a single operating unit 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas no 
 which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and requires retrospective application a term defined by the statement to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine the effect of a change 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt sfas no 
as of the beginning of fiscal  and we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
this pronouncement recommends a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the company s tax return 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
the accounting provisions of fin will be effective for our first fiscal quarter of fiscal we are in the process of evaluating the effect  if any  the adoption of fin will have on our financial statements 
in september  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab  which addresses how uncorrected errors in previous years should be considered when quantifying errors in current year financial statements 
sab requires registrants to consider the effect of all carry over and reversing effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying errors in current year financial statements 
sab allows registrants to record the effects of adopting the guidance as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings 
we will adopt sab as of the beginning of fiscal and do not expect that the adoption of sab will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income and expense items of steelcloud for the fiscal years ended october     and  as a percentage of net revenues 
the consolidated statement of operations data set forth below with respect to the fiscal years ended october   does not reflect the maintenance and support agreement net revenue reclassification as described in note reclassification of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k as the effect in those periods was not material

fiscal year ended october  increase decrease of net of net dollars revenues dollars revenues dollars percentage products services total net revenues the decrease in product revenue is primarily attributable to the completion of several significant contracts with one federal integrator during fiscal year and the lack of comparable orders or contracts in fiscal the company recognized revenue of approximately million associated with this integrator for the twelve month period ended october  compared to approximately million during the same period in fiscal year partially offsetting the decrease was higher demand for isv products generated by new and existing customers throughout and an increase in third party software solution products  where we act as a reseller  as a result of the company engaging new channel partners during the first half of fiscal although third party software solution product revenue increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  the company has begun to transition away from the third party solution business  which typically carry lower margins  and focus on the federal integrator and isv businesses  the company s core business 
as a result  the company expects total revenue to decrease during the first half of fiscal as revenues associated with the lower margin  third party software sales continue to decrease 
the company has begun to focus on improving its isv and integrator revenues but does not anticipate total net revenue to increase until late fiscal due to the long sales cycles associated with these markets 
the decrease in service revenue is primarily the result of the completion of certain long term contracts in fiscal coupled with a lack of new service contracts in fiscal to replace this revenue 
during fiscal  the company expected certain revenue levels from its partnerships that never materialized 
consequently  the company has determined to serve this market directly rather than through its strategic partners 
in addition  service revenue associated with the acquisition of asgard  decreased to approximately  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year as a result of the company closing the florida office in fiscal year gross margin discussion the following table summarizes steelcloud s gross margin for the fiscal years ended october  and in dollars  as a percentage of gross margin and as a percentage of net revenues 
fiscal year ended october  increase decrease of net of net dollars margin dollars margin dollars percentage products products gm services services gm total gross margin total gm the decrease in product gross margin is primarily due to the completion of significant contracts in fiscal gross margins on long term contracts historically increase throughout the contract life cycle and are typically at their highest point near the end of the contract 
margins increase throughout the contract due to the incurrence of start up costs at contract initiation 
in addition  the purchasing power for larger contracts enables the company to reduce its materials costs throughout the contract 
the decrease can also be attributed to the growth in third party software solution product revenues during the first half of fiscal  which traditionally have lower gross margins  compared to the same period in the company also incurred costs of approximately  to write down the inventoried costs of end of life products during fiscal year the company announced these product life ends and does not anticipate additional write downs relating to these products 
although the company expects gross margins to increase as it transitions away from the low margin  third party solution business  the company expects gross margin as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as product lines expand  new products are brought to market  start up costs are incurred  and new discounts  incentives and rebates become available 
the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue is attributable to investments in technical consultant staff  the use of resources to develop the company s higher margin  project based service offerings as well as the company continuing to support partnership requirements by maintaining certified and available resources for immediate deployment for potential contracts 
as previously mentioned  the company s expected service revenues from certain partnerships never materialized 
the company anticipates gross margin for services to increase in future quarters as a result of the company s restructuring efforts whereby the company will sell services directly and better utilize its individual consultants available for contracts 
operating expense discussion the following table summarizes steelcloud s operating expenses for the fiscal years ended october  and in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues 
fiscal year ended october  increase decrease of net of net dollars revenues dollars revenues dollars percentage selling and marketing general and administrative research and product development impairment of goodwill and other intangibles amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets severance and restructuring costs total operating expenses the increase in selling and marketing expense is the result of deploying additional sales personnel in order to increase brand recognition and expand the company s customer base 
for the first half of fiscal  the company made investments in areas outside the company s core business that did not return the expected results 
during the second half of fiscal year  the company took steps to eliminate unsuccessful business activities  specifically the resale of certain third party solutions  to focus and reinvest in the company s core business  the federal integrator and isv markets 
although the company anticipates selling and marketing expenses to increase as new products and services are introduced  the company will continue to evaluate its costs relative to its revenues and gross margins 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of approximately  of costs associated with the amendment and termination of the employment contract of the company s former president during fiscal year this increase was offset due to the company s cost cutting efforts that took place during the second half of fiscal year these cost reductions included curtailing expenses related to non revenue generating activities  terminating non essential employees  and instituting an across the board departmental expense reduction 
although the company continues to manage its costs relative to its revenues and gross margins  additional resources will be required in order to invest in its core federal integrator and isv business 
the decrease in research and product development expense is the result of the company s restructuring activities  specifically the termination of the audit compliance system acs project during fiscal year as mentioned in note commitments  the company closed its florida office during fiscal year and transitioned all remaining research and development activities to its corporate office where the company will continue to make investments in research and development to maintain and grow current products 
the decrease is also attributable to certain product development resources being used for sales support activities during fiscal year compared to the same period in fiscal the company believes that research and development expenses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as new products are being developed and introduced into the marketplace 
the impairment of goodwill charge during the third quarter of fiscal year was the result of the company determining a triggering event had occurred under sfas as described in note goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  management re assessed the recoverability of goodwill carried on its financial statements and determined its goodwill and other intangible assets were fully impaired 
consequently  the company recognized an impairment loss of approximately  in the third quarter of fiscal in order to write down the carrying value of its goodwill to its estimated fair value 
as of october   the company no longer has any goodwill or other intangible assets associated with acquisitions on its balance sheet 
the severance and restructuring charge during fiscal year is the result of non recurring costs associated with the closing of its florida office in the amount of  as described in note management change  restructuring and operations  severance payments as a result of the company s restructuring in the amount of  and expenses associated with the separation agreement entered into with the company s former chief executive officer ceo  in the amount of  the separation agreement provided for the former ceo to resign as chairman and member of the company s board of directors 
simultaneous with the resignation  the company entered into a month consulting arrangement whereby the former ceo will provide certain advisory services to the company s board of directors and management team during the transition 
under the terms of the agreement  the former ceo shall receive approximately  months at his former base salary of  per annum 
in addition  the company will continue to provide health and dental coverage for the former ceo and his family  a leased car for his use and the transfer of a company automobile in exchange for forgiveness of certain accounts payable that the company owes to the former ceo and his family 
the resignation was made in response to the results of an investigation by the audit committee of the board relating to matters associated with the attempted exercise of certain employee stock options owned by the former ceo 
the matter was discovered through the operation of the company s internal controls and procedures and did not result in any direct financial loss or have any direct effect on the company s financial statements 
the company s former ceo has denied any wrongdoing in connection with this matter 
other income expense discussion the following table summarizes steelcloud s other income expense for the fiscal years ended october  and in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues 
fiscal year ended october  increase decrease of net of net dollars revenues dollars revenues dollars percentage interest income net other expense  net total other income expense the increase in interest income  net  is the result of the company s interest income for fiscal year was higher than the comparable period in fiscal year due to increases in interest rates as well as a decrease in interest expense during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase in other expense  net  is primarily the result of non recurring legal and professional services fees resulting from the investigation of an attempted exercise of certain employee stock options incurred in fiscal year  as described in note management changes  restructuring and operations 
net loss discussion the following table summarizes steelcloud s net loss for the fiscal years ended october  and in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues 
fiscal year ended october  increase decrease of net of net dollars revenues dollars revenues dollars percentage net loss the net loss increase is attributable to the company s increased deliveries of product associated with significant contract awards during fiscal year in addition  the company incurred significant  one time  non recurring expenses during fiscal year these expenses included  of charges incurred to write down the company s goodwill and other intangible assets to their fair value   in severance and restructuring charges   of non recurring legal and professional services fees   in costs associated with the termination of an employment contract with the former president who resigned in june   in income tax expense due to the adjustment of the tax valuation allowance and approximately  in expense for inventory obsolescence primarily associated with obsolete products 
fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended october  net revenue discussion the following table summarizes steelcloud s net revenue for the fiscal years ended october  and in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues 
fiscal year ended october  increase decrease of net of net dollars revenues dollars revenues dollars percentage products services total net revenues the net revenue increase is primarily attributable to deliveries associated with several significant contracts with a federal integrator during fiscal year these contracts  valued at approximately million  generated revenue of approximately million during fiscal year these deliveries resulted in a total increase in integrator product revenues of approximately million in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year higher demand caused an increase in isv product sales by approximately million during fiscal year as compared to fiscal the company has been engaging new channel partners in an effort to enhance and diversify its product offerings and expand its revenue base 
as a result  solution product revenues increased by million in fiscal year from fiscal year the decrease in service revenues is primarily the result of the changes in the company s channel partner relationships  a key driver of services revenues 
in addition  investments in training and technical consulting staff were made in order to position the company to enter new market segments and provide future growth opportunities 
as such  revenue activities have been impacted as time and resources have been required to cultivate these new relationships and develop these additional service capabilities 
service revenue associated with the acquisition of asgard increased to approximately  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year no revenues associated with the asgard acquisition were recognized in the first quarter of fiscal year gross margin discussion the following table summarizes steelcloud s gross margin for the fiscal years ended october  and in dollars  as a percentage of gross margin and as a percentage of net revenues 
fiscal year ended october  increase decrease of net of net dollars revenues dollars revenues dollars percentage products products gm services services gm total gross margin total gm the increase in product gross margin  as a percentage of net revenues  is primarily due to lower product costs realized with the shipment of significant product backlog  as the company utilized its cash on hand and purchasing power to take advantage of product discounts  incentives  and rebates available in the marketplace 
in addition  start up costs associated with the company s contracts from fiscal year were primarily incurred during the initial delivery phase 
the company s anticipated gross margins have increased since these initial deliveries 
the company expects gross margin as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as product lines expand  new products are brought to market  start up costs are incurred and new discounts  incentives and rebates become available 
the gross margin decrease for services  as a percentage of net revenues  is the result of lower service revenue associated with the channel products during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease is also attributable to the company s transition of its services group from focusing on general information technology to specializing in security services 
accordingly  this specialization requires high end channel resources  significant training of these resources  pre sales support  and performing non billable engagements to gain qualifications  all of which has had a direct impact on gross margin 
as the company deploys its new service offerings  it anticipates margin growth 
operating expense discussion the following table summarizes steelcloud s operating expenses for the fiscal years ended october  and in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues 
fiscal year ended october  increase decrease of net of net dollars revenues dollars revenues dollars percentage selling and marketing general and administrative research and product development amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets total operating expenses the decrease in selling and marketing expense is attributable to the sales and marketing efforts associated with new server appliance relationships in not generating the business results anticipated
