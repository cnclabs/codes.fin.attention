item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation management s overview we provide a wide range of well site services to oil and gas drilling and producing companies  including well servicing  fluid services  drilling and completion services and well site construction services 
our results of operations since the beginning of reflect the impact of our acquisition strategy as a leading consolidator in the 
table of contents domestic land based well services industry during this period 
our acquisitions have increased our breadth of service offerings at the well site and expanded our market presence 
in implementing this strategy  we have purchased businesses and assets in separate acquisitions from january  to december  our weighted average number of well servicing rigs has increased from in to in the fourth quarter of  and our weighted average number of fluid service trucks has increased from to in the same period 
in  primarily through acquisitions  we significantly increased our drilling and completion principally pressure pumping and rental and fishing tools service 
these acquisitions make changes in revenues  expenses and income not directly comparable 
our operating revenues from each of our segments  and their relative percentages of our total revenues  consisted of the following dollars in millions year ended december  revenues well servicing fluid services drilling and completion services well site construction services total revenues our core businesses depend on our customers willingness to make expenditures to produce  develop and explore for oil and gas in the united states 
industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors  such as the supply of and demand for oil and gas  domestic and worldwide economic conditions  political instability in oil producing countries and merger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers 
the volatility of the oil and gas industry  and the consequent impact on exploration and production activity  could adversely impact the level of drilling and workover activity by some of our customers 
this volatility affects the demand for our services and the price of our services 
in addition  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves in our market areas also may have an impact on our business  even in an environment of stronger oil and gas prices 
for a more comprehensive discussion of our industry trends  see business general industry overview 
we derive a majority of our revenues from services supporting production from existing oil and gas operations 
demand for these production related services  including well servicing and fluid services  tends to remain relatively stable  even in moderate oil and gas price environments  as ongoing maintenance spending is required to sustain production 
as oil and gas prices reach higher levels  demand for all of our services generally increases as our customers engage in more well servicing activities relating to existing wells to maintain or increase oil and gas production from those wells 
because our services are required to support drilling and workover activities  we are also subject to changes in capital spending by our customers as oil and gas prices increase or decrease 
we believe that the most important performance measures for our lines of business are as follows well servicing rig hours  rig utilization rate  revenue per rig hour and segment profits as a percent of revenues  fluid services revenue per truck and segment profits as a percent of revenues  drilling and completion services segment profits as a percent of revenues  and well site construction services segment profits as a percent of revenues 
segment profits are computed as segment operating revenues less direct operating costs 
these measurements provide important information to us about the activity and profitability of our lines of business 
for a detailed analysis of these indicators for our company  see below in segment overview 
we intend to continue growing our business through selective acquisitions  continuing a newbuild program and or upgrading our existing assets 
our capital investment decisions are determined by an analysis of the projected return on capital employed of each of those alternatives  which is substantially driven by the cost to 
table of contents acquire existing assets from a third party  the capital required to build new equipment and the point in the oil and gas commodity price cycle 
based on these factors  we make capital investment decisions that we believe will support our long term growth strategy 
while we believe our costs of integration for prior acquisitions have been reflected in our historical results of operations  integration of acquisitions may result in unforeseen operational difficulties or require a disproportionate amount of our management s attention 
as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources  we also must meet certain financial covenants in order to borrow money under our existing credit agreement to fund future acquisitions recent strategic acquisitions and expansions during the period through  we grew significantly through acquisitions and capital expenditures 
during and  we directed our focus for growth more on the integration and expansion of our existing businesses  through capital expenditures and to a lesser extent  acquisitions

segment overview well servicing in  our well servicing segment represented of our revenues 
revenue in our well servicing segment is derived from maintenance  workover  completion and plugging and abandonment services 
we provide maintenance related services as part of the normal  periodic upkeep of producing oil and gas wells 
maintenance related services represent a relatively consistent component of our business 
workover and completion services generate more revenue per hour than maintenance work due to the use of auxiliary equipment  but demand for workover and completion services fluctuates more with the overall activity level in the industry 
we typically charge our customers for services on an hourly basis at rates that are determined by the type of service and equipment required  market conditions in the region in which the rig operates  the ancillary equipment provided on the rig and the necessary personnel 
depending on the type of job  we may also charge by the project or by the day 
we measure our activity levels by the total number of hours worked by all of the rigs in our fleet 
we monitor our fleet utilization levels  with full utilization deemed to be hours per week per rig 
our fleet has increased from a weighted average number of rigs in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of through a combination of new build purchases and the remainder through acquisitions and other individual equipment purchases 

table of contents the following is an analysis of our well servicing operations for each of the quarters and years in the years ended december   and weighted segment average rig profits number of rig utilization revenue per per rig segment rigs hours rate rig hour hour profits first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year we gauge activity levels in our well servicing segment based on rig utilization rate  revenue per rig hour and segment profits per rig hour 
improving market conditions since have created increased demand for our services 
rig hours have increased due to a combination of the improved utilization of our well servicing rigs and the expansion of our well servicing fleet as a result of our newbuild rig program 
we have been able to increase our revenue per rig hour from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of mainly as a result of this higher utilization  which has contributed to our improved segment profits 
fluid services in  our fluid services segment represented of our revenues 
revenues in our fluid services segment are earned from the sale  transportation  storage and disposal of fluids used in the drilling  production and maintenance of oil and gas wells 
the fluid services segment has a base level of business consisting of transporting and disposing of salt water produced as a by product of the production of oil and gas 
these services are necessary for our customers and generally have a stable demand but typically produce lower relative segment profits than other parts of our fluid services segment 
fluid services for completion and workover projects typically require fresh or brine water for making drilling mud  circulating fluids or frac fluids used during a job  and all of these fluids require storage tanks and hauling and disposal 
because we can provide a full complement of fluid sales  trucking  storage and disposal required on most drilling and workover projects  the add on services associated with drilling and workover activity enable us to generate higher segment profits contributions 
the higher segment profits are due to the relatively small incremental labor costs associated with providing these services in addition to our base fluid services segment 
we typically price fluid services by the job  by the hour or by the quantities sold  disposed of or hauled 

table of contents the following is an analysis of our fluid services operations for each of the quarters and years in the years ended december   and dollars in thousands segment weighted profits average per number of revenue per fluid fluid service fluid service service segment trucks truck truck profits first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year we gauge activity levels in our fluid services segment based on revenue and segment profits per fluid service truck 
improved market conditions since have enabled us to further increase our fluid services truck fleet through internal expansion 
during  we also expanded this segment with the acquisition of lebus 
the majority of the increase in revenue per fluid services truck from  in the first quarter of to  in the fourth quarter of is due to the revenues derived from the expansion of our frac tank fleet and disposal facilities as well as minor pricing improvement from our fluid services trucks 
our segment profits per fluid services truck have increased because of these factors and increased utilization of our equipment 
drilling and completion services in  our drilling and completion services segment represented of our revenues 
revenues from our drilling and completion services segment are generally derived from a variety of services designed to stimulate oil and gas production or place cement slurry within the wellbores 
our drilling and completion services segment includes pressure pumping  cased hole wireline services  underbalanced drilling and rental and fishing tool operations 
our pressure pumping operations concentrate on providing single truck  lower horsepower cementing  acidizing and fracturing services in selected markets 
we entered the market for pressure pumping in east texas during late  and we expanded our presence with the acquisition of new force in january we entered this market in the rocky mountain states with the acquisition of fesco  which had a small cementing business based in gillette  wyoming 
in december  we acquired the assets of graham acidizing and integrated these assets into our north texas and east texas operations 

table of contents we entered the wireline business in as part of our acquisition of aws wireline  a regional firm based in north texas 
we entered the underbalanced drilling services business in through our acquisition of energy air drilling services  a business operating in northwest new mexico and the western slope of colorado markets 
for a description of our wireline and underbalanced drilling services  please read business overview of our segments and services drilling and completion services segment 
we entered the rental and fishing tool business through our acquisition of g l in the first quarter of this acquisition added stores in the north texas  west texas  and oklahoma markets 
in this segment  we generally derive our revenues on a project by project basis in a competitive bidding process 
our bids are generally based on the amount and type of equipment and personnel required  with the materials consumed billed separately 
during periods of decreased spending by oil and gas companies  we may be required to discount our rates to remain competitive  which would cause lower segment profits 
the following is an analysis of our drilling and completion services segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended december   and dollars in thousands segment revenues profits first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year we gauge the performance of our drilling and completion services segment based on the segment s operating revenues and segment profits 
improved market conditions since have enabled us to increase our pricing for these services  contributing to the improved segment profits as a percentage of segment revenues 
well site construction services in  our well site construction services segment represented of our revenues 
revenues from our well site construction services segment are derived primarily from preparing and maintaining access roads and well locations  installing small diameter gathering lines and pipelines  constructing foundations to support drilling rigs and providing maintenance services for oil and gas facilities 
these services are independent of our other services and  while offered to some customers utilizing other services  are not offered on a bundled basis 
we entered the well site construction services segment during the fourth quarter of in the gulf coast through the acquisition of pwi and in the rocky mountain states through our acquisition of fesco 
within this segment  we generally charge established hourly rates or competitive bid for projects depending on customer specifications and equipment and personnel requirements 
this segment allows us to perform services to 
table of contents customers outside the oil and gas industry  since substantially all of our power units are general purpose construction equipment 
however  the majority of our current business in this segment is with customers in the oil and gas industry 
if our customer base has the demand for certain types of power units that we do not currently own  we generally purchase or lease them without significant delay 
the following is an analysis of our well site construction services services segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended december   and dollars in thousands segment revenues profits first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year we gauge the performance of our well site construction services segment based on the segment s operating revenues and segment profits 
while we monitor our levels of idle equipment  we do not focus on revenues per piece of equipment 
operating cost overview our operating costs are comprised primarily of labor  including workers compensation and health insurance  repair and maintenance  fuel and insurance 
a majority of our employees are paid on an hourly basis 
with a reduced pool of workers in the industry  it is possible that we will have to raise wage rates to attract workers from other fields and retain or expand our current work force 
we believe we will be able to increase service rates to our customers to compensate for wage rate increases 
we also incur costs to employ personnel to sell and supervise our services and perform maintenance on our fleet 
these costs are not directly tied to our level of business activity 
compensation for our administrative personnel in local operating yards and in our corporate office is accounted for as general and administrative expenses 
repair and maintenance is performed by our crews  company maintenance personnel and outside service providers 
insurance is generally a fixed cost regardless of utilization and relates to the number of rigs  trucks and other equipment in our fleet  employee payroll and safety record 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
a complete summary of these policies is included in note of the notes to our historical consolidated financial statements 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 

table of contents critical accounting policies we have identified below accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position  results of operations and cash flows and which require the application of significant judgment by management 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are stated at cost  or at estimated fair value at acquisition date if acquired in a business combination 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
we also review the capitalization of refurbishment of workover rigs as described in note of the notes to our historical consolidated financial statements 
impairments 
we review our assets for impairment at a minimum annually  or whenever  in management s judgment  events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recovered over its remaining service life 
provisions for asset impairment are charged to income when the sum of the estimated future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  is less than the assets carrying amount 
when impairment is indicated  an impairment charge is recorded based on an estimate of future cash flows on a discounted basis 
self insured risk accruals 
we are self insured up to retention limits with regard to workers compensation and medical and dental coverage of our employees 
we generally maintain no physical property damage coverage on our workover rig fleet  with the exception of certain of our hour workover rigs and newly manufactured rigs 
we have deductibles per occurrence for workers compensation and medical and dental coverage of  and  respectively 
we have lower deductibles per occurrence for automobile liability and general liability 
we maintain accruals in our consolidated balance sheets related to self insurance retentions by using third party actuarial data and historical claims history 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues when the services are performed  collection of the relevant receivables is probable  persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists and the price is fixed and determinable 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes based upon statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in the period that includes the statutory enactment date 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recognized when it is more likely than not that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
we analyze our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
depreciation and amortization 
in order to depreciate and amortize our property and equipment and our intangible assets with finite lives  we estimate the useful lives and salvage values of these items 
our estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions  technological advances in industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
impairment of property and equipment 
our impairment of property and equipment requires us to estimate undiscounted future cash flows 
actual impairment charges are recorded using an estimate of discounted future cash flows 
the determination of future cash flows requires us to estimate rates and utilization in future periods and such estimates can change based on market conditions  technological advances in industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on an analysis of historical collection activity and specific identification of overdue accounts 
factors that may affect this estimate include changes in the financial positions of significant customers and a decline in commodity prices that could affect the entire customer base 
litigation and self insured risk reserves 
we estimate our reserves related to litigation and self insure risk based on the facts and circumstances specific to the litigation and self insured risk claims and our past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of litigated and insured claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts 
as discussed in self insured risk accruals above with respect to our critical accounting policies  we maintain accruals on our balance sheet to cover self insured retentions 
these accruals are based on certain assumptions developed using third party data and historical data to project future losses 
loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are adjusted based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations  which involves the use of various assumptions 
these estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions  technological advances in industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
the most significant assumptions  and the ones requiring the most judgment  involve the estimated fair value of property and equipment  intangible assets and the resulting amount of goodwill  if any 
our adoption of sfas no 
on january  requires us to test annually for impairment the goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives recorded in business combinations 
this requires us to estimate the fair values of our own assets and liabilities at the reporting unit level 
therefore  considerable judgment  similar to that described above in connection with our estimation of the fair value of acquired company  is required to assess goodwill and certain intangible assets for impairment 
cash flow estimates 
our estimates of future cash flows are based on the most recent available market and operating data for the applicable asset or reporting unit at the time the estimate is made 
our cash flow estimates are used for asset impairment analyses 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
prior to january   we accounted for share based payments under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
which was permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

we adopted sfas no 
r using both the modified prospective method and the prospective method as applicable to the specific awards granted 
the modified prospective method was applied to awards granted subsequent to the company becoming a public company 
awards granted prior to the company becoming public and which were accounted for under apb no 
were adopted by using the prospective method 
the results of prior periods have not been restated 
compensation expense of the unvested portion of awards granted as a private company and outstanding as of january  will continue to be based upon the intrinsic value method calculated under apb no 
the fair value of common stock for options granted from july  through september  was estimated by management using an internal valuation methodology 
we did not obtain contemporaneous valuations by an unrelated valuation specialist because we were focused on internal growth and acquisitions and because we had consistently used our internal valuation methodology for previous stock awards 
income taxes 
the amount and availability of our loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes are subject to a variety of interpretations and restrictive tests 
the utilization of such carryforwards could be limited or lost upon certain changes in ownership and the passage of time 
accordingly  although we believe substantial loss carryforwards are available to us  no assurance can be given concerning the realization of such loss carryforwards  or whether or not such loss carryforwards will be available in the future 
asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires us to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and to capitalize an equal amount as a cost of the asset  depreciating it over the life of the asset 

table of contents subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation is adjusted at the end of each quarter to reflect the passage of time  changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation  acquisition or construction of assets  and settlement of obligations 
results of operations the results of operations between periods will not be comparable  primarily due to the significant number of acquisitions made and their relative timing in the year acquired 
see note of the notes to our historical consolidated financial statements for more detail
