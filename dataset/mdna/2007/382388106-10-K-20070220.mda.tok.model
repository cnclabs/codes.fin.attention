this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
see forward looking information is subject to risk and uncertainty for a discussion of certain of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
our former jcair inc 
test systems business has been accounted for as discontinued operations 
unless otherwise noted herein  disclosures pertain only to our continuing operations 
overview we are one of the largest worldwide suppliers of aerospace components  systems and services to the commercial and general aviation airplane markets 
we are also a leading supplier of systems and products to the global defense and space markets 
our business is conducted globally with manufacturing  service and sales undertaken in various locations throughout the world 
our products and services are principally sold to customers in north america  europe and asia 
key market channels for products and services  growth drivers and industry and our highlights we participate in three key market channels commercial and general aviation airplane original equipment oe  commercial and general aviation airplane aftermarket  and defense and space 
commercial and general aviation airplane oe commercial and general aviation airplane oe includes sales of products and services for new airplanes produced by airbus sas airbus and the boeing company boeing  as well as regional  business and small airplane manufacturers 
the key growth drivers in this market channel include the number of orders for new airplanes  which will be delivered to the manufacturers customers over a period of several years  oe manufacturer production and delivery rates and introductions of new airplane models such as the boeing and  the airbus a and a xwb and the embraer airplanes 
we have significant sales content on most of the airplanes manufactured in this market channel 
we have benefited from increased production rates and deliveries of airbus and boeing airplanes and from our substantial content on many of the regional and general aviation airplanes 
we were also awarded several new contracts for our products on airplanes currently in a pre production stage  including the boeing and and the airbus a and a xwb  which should provide substantial future sales growth for us 
during and  orders for airbus and boeing commercial airplanes were at record levels  with many of the orders for deliveries beyond while orders for regional airplanes were not nearly as strong in as those for the larger airplanes  the unfilled backlog of orders remained substantial 
during  orders for general aviation airplanes  including business jets  continued to be strong as well 
these orders are expected to generate substantial future sales for us 

table of contents commercial and general aviation airplane aftermarket the commercial and general aviation airplane aftermarket channel includes sales of products and services for existing commercial and general aviation airplanes  primarily to airlines and package carriers around the world 
the key growth drivers in this channel include worldwide passenger capacity growth measured by available seat miles asm and the size and activity level of the airplane fleet 
other important factors affecting growth in this market channel are the age of the airplanes in the fleet and gross domestic product gdp trends in countries and regions around the world 
we estimate that capacity in the global airline system  as measured by asms  will grow approximately to annually in through we expect that the global airplane fleet will continue to grow in and beyond  as the oe manufacturers are expected to deliver more airplanes than are retired 
we have significant product content on most of the airplane models that are currently in service 
we have benefited from good growth in asms  especially in asia  and from the aging of the worldwide fleet of airplanes 
defense and space worldwide defense and space sales include sales to prime contractors such as boeing  northrop grumman  lockheed martin  the us government and foreign companies and governments 
the key growth drivers in this channel include the level of defense spending by the us and foreign governments  the number of new platform starts  the level of military flight operations and the level of upgrade  overhaul and maintenance activities associated with existing platforms 
the market for our defense and space products is global  and is not dependent on any single program  platform or customer 
while we anticipate fewer new platform starts over the next several years  which are expected to negatively affect oe sales  we anticipate that upgrades on existing defense and space platforms will be necessary and will provide long term growth in this market channel 
additionally  we are participating in  and developing new products for the rapidly expanding homeland security and intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance sectors  which should further strengthen our position in this market channel 
long term sustainable growth we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our commercial airplane and defense and space sales due to awards for key products on important new and expected programs  including the airbus a and a xwb  the boeing and  the embraer  the dassault falcon x and the lockheed martin f lightning ii and f raptor  growing commercial airplane fleet  which should fuel sustained aftermarket strength  balance in the large commercial airplane market  with strong sales to both airbus and boeing  aging of the existing large commercial and regional airplane fleets  which should result in increased aftermarket support  increased number of long term agreements for product sales on new and existing commercial airplanes  increased opportunities for aftermarket growth due to airline outsourcing  
table of contents growth in global maintenance  repair and overhaul opportunities for our systems and components  particularly in europe  asia and the middle east  where we are expanding our capacity  and expansion of our product offerings in support of high growth areas in the defense and space market channel  such as intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance products 
year ended december  sales content by market channel during  approximately of our sales were from our three primary market channels described above 
following is a summary of the percentage of sales by market channel airbus commercial oe boeing commercial oe regional and general aviation airplane oe total commercial and general aviation airplane oe large commercial airplane aftermarket regional and general aviation airplane aftermarket heavy airplane maintenance total commercial and general aviation airplane aftermarket total defense and space other total summary performance year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  change dollars in millions  except diluted eps sales segment operating income percent of sales income from continuing operations net income capital expenditures net cash provided by operating activities diluted eps continuing operations net income segment operating income is total segment revenue reduced by operating expenses directly identifiable with our business segments 
segment operating income is used by management to assess the operating performance of the segments 
for a reconciliation of total segment operating income to total operating income  see note  business segment information to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents our sales and income performance was driven primarily by sales growth in our commercial  regional and general aviation airplane market channels as follows large commercial airplane oe sales increased by more than  regional  business and general aviation airplane oe sales increased  and large commercial  regional and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales increased by  with continued strong sales of nacelles and thrust reverser systems and related services 
the sales growth described above was partially offset by a decrease in defense and space oe and aftermarket sales of approximately  which is net of defense and space sales growth in the electronic systems segment of

during  we incurred charges approximating million to reserve for costs associated with the redesign and retrofit of actuators for the a aircraft 
during  we recorded net cumulative catch up charges of million and a charge of million related to the termination of the boeing ng contract at our aerostructures business 
during  net cumulative catch up charges were million 
the net cumulative catch up charges during resulted from significant increased cost estimates primarily on two contracts  which more than offset reduced cost estimates on other contracts 
during  we exchanged approximately million of our long term notes for similar notes of longer duration 
the exchange reduces the amount of debt that matures in the years from to and the interest rates associated with the refinanced debt is lower than the debt it replaced 
we recorded a charge of million for costs associated with the transaction 
during  we recorded premiums and other costs of million associated with the early retirement of million of long term debt 
during  we reported an effective tax rate benefit of  including a benefit of approximately related to the rohr and coltec tax cases and for several additional settlements and refunds 
the effective tax rate excluding the benefit related to these items would have been approximately for income from discontinued operations  after tax  was million per diluted share and million per diluted share  during and  respectively 
during  we recognized a million after tax gain on the sale of test systems 
during and  income from discontinued operations included insurance settlements with several insurers relating to the recovery of past costs 
for additional information  see note  discontinued operations to our consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by operating activities for was million  a decrease of million from net cash provided by operating activities of million for the decrease was primarily related to the cash outlay of million related to unwinding our accounts receivable securitization program  tax payments of million associated with the rohr and coltec tax settlements  and increased investments in pre production and excess over average inventories of million  partially offset by  increased net income of approximately million  adjusted to exclude certain non cash items including income recognized from the rohr and coltec tax settlements  increased share based compensation expense and increased amortization and depreciation 
during and  capital expenditures totaled million and million  respectively 

table of contents outlook we expect the following results for the year ending december  outlook actual sales billion billion diluted eps net income per share per share capital expenditures million million operating cash flow net of capital expenditures of income from continuing operations of income from continuing operations includes a tax benefit of related primarily to the rohr and coltec settlements 
we expect that will be another year of strong sales growth with improving segment operating income margins 
we expect that full year sales will be in the range of to billion and net income per diluted share to be to 
the outlook assumes  among other factors  an effective tax rate of to and successful completion of negotiations of a new long term agreement to supply landing gear to boeing 
the benefit of the slightly lower tax rate for is likely to be offset by higher costs associated with pension expense and foreign exchange translation 
to provide the most meaningful comparison between net income per diluted share for and expected net income per diluted share  we believe that the net income per diluted share of for should be adjusted to remove the per diluted share related primarily to the rohr and coltec tax settlements since tax benefits of this magnitude are not expected to recur in excluding these tax settlements  net income per diluted share for was  compared to expected results of to for we expect net cash provided by operating activities  minus capital expenditures  to be in the range of to of net income in this outlook reflects a continuation of cash expenditures for investments in the boeing and the airbus a xwb and capital expenditures for facility expansions to support increased aftermarket demand  low cost country manufacturing and productivity initiatives designed to enhance margins over the near and long term 
we expect capital expenditures for to be in a range of to million 
of these capital expenditures  approximately are expected to be associated with investments in low cost country manufacturing  previously announced maintenance  repair and overhaul mro facility expansions and new facilities to support aftermarket sales growth  and expenditures related to the company wide implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system 
also included are worldwide pension contributions of million to million  most of which are voluntary contributions 
the sales  net income and net cash provided by operating activities outlook for do not include the impact of acquisitions or divestitures or resolution of an a claim against northrop 
our outlook is based on certain market assumptions  including the following we expect deliveries of airbus and boeing large commercial aircraft to increase by about to in compared to our sales of large commercial aircraft oe products are projected to increase by about the same rate as the increase in deliveries in capacity in the global airline system  as measured by asms  is expected to grow at about to in our sales to airlines and package carriers for large commercial and regional aircraft aftermarket parts and services are expected to grow at a higher rate than the overall market growth in compared to 
table of contents total regional and business aircraft production is expected to increase slightly in compared to deliveries to embraer in support of its embraer aircraft  which includes a significant amount of our content  are expected to enable us to increase sales in this market channel by approximately in compared to defense and space sales oe and aftermarket are expected to grow by approximately to in compared to  reflecting continued strong growth for defense and space products in our electronic systems segment  and a resumption of growth in the engine systems segment 
results of operations adoption of sfas no 
r on december   the fasb issued sfas sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows 
we adopted the sfas fair value based method of accounting for share based payments effective january  using the modified prospective method described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
we adopted sfas r on january  using the modified prospective transition method 
at december   we had seven types of share based compensation awards  which are described in note  share based compensation plans  to our consolidated financial statements 
because we adopted the accounting provisions of sfas effective january   the compensation cost recognized in accordance with sfas during and should be consistent with the cost that would have been recorded under sfas r  except for the following differences sfas r requires entities to apply the same attribution method to all awards subject to graded vesting 
we have two types of share based compensation awards that are subject to graded vesting stock options and restricted stock units 
in the years prior to january   stock options were accounted for under the straight line attribution method and restricted stock units were accounted for under the accelerated attribution method 
effective upon the adoption of sfas r  we made a policy election to apply the straight line method to all share based awards that are subject to graded vesting 
during  expense of million was recognized on restricted stock units as compared to million if the straight line method was used 
the incremental expense recorded in as compared to the straight line method was million million after tax  or per diluted share 
during  expense of million was recognized on restricted stock units as compared to million if the straight line method was used 
the incremental expense recorded in compared to the straight line method was million million after tax  or per diluted share 
we previously accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
in accordance with sfas r  we are required to estimate forfeitures at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest 
effective january   we recorded income of million million after tax  or per diluted share to adjust previously recognized compensation cost as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting on unvested awards to the amount of compensation cost recognized had forfeitures been estimated 
in accordance with sfas  we previously recorded compensation cost on performance unit awards using the intrinsic value method 
however  sfas r requires liability awards to be accounted for using the fair value method 
one half of our performance unit awards have a market condition  which must be considered in the determination of 
table of contents fair value 
effective january   we recorded expense of million million after tax to adjust previously recognized compensation cost on vested performance unit awards to the amount of compensation recognized had the fair value of the awards been recorded prior to the adoption of sfas r 
this amount was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting 
during and  million and million  respectively  of realized tax benefits on non qualified options and restricted shares were reported in net cash provided by operating activities 
these amounts represent the net tax benefits that were in excess of recorded compensation expense  which are recorded in additional paid in capital 
in accordance with sfas r  the tax benefits in excess of pro forma compensation expense are reclassified to net cash used in financing activities 
pro forma compensation expense is calculated using the fair value of options as if the accounting provisions of sfas had been applied since the january  effective date 
accordingly  million is now recorded in net cash used in financing activities during the realized net tax benefit that was recorded in additional paid in capital and based on actual compensation expense  totaled million during in accordance with sfas r  recognition of compensation expense on grants made subsequent to january  to retirement eligible individuals begins on the date the grants are approved since no future substantive service is required 
grants to individuals who will become retirement eligible prior to the normal vesting date will be expensed over the requisite service period ie  from the grant date through date of retirement eligibility 
compensation expense related to grants prior to the adoption of sfas r will continue to be recognized over the explicit vesting period  which is generally three or five years  with acceleration of any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when an employee actually retires 
as a result of applying these provisions of sfas r  compensation expense of approximately million million after tax  or per diluted share was recognized during  which was comprised of the following approximately million million after tax  or per diluted share related to accelerated expense for grants to individuals who were retirement eligible on the grant date or who will become retirement eligible in advance of the normal vesting date 
this compares to approximately million of expense million after tax  or per diluted share if the previous method was used 
approximately million million after tax  or per diluted share related to accelerated expense for grants to individuals who were retirement eligible on the december approval date 
under sfas  this expense would have been recognized beginning in the compensation cost recorded for share based compensation plans during totaled million million after tax  or per diluted share as compared to million million after tax  or per diluted share during and million million after tax  or per diluted share during the increase of million from to was primarily driven by approximately million of incremental compensation expense during as a result of recognizing an accelerated portion of the total compensation expense on awards granted to employees who are retirement eligible or will become retirement eligible prior to the normal vesting date 
changes in accounting methods effective january   we changed two aspects of the application of contract accounting to preferable methods for our aerostructures business  which is included in the engine systems segment 
the first is a change to the cumulative catch up method from the reallocation method for accounting for changes in contract estimates of revenue and costs 
the change was effected 
table of contents by adjusting contract profit rates from the balance to complete gross profit rate to the estimated gross profit rate at completion of the contract 
the second change related to pre certification costs 
under the old policy  pre certification costs exceeding the level anticipated in our original investment model used to negotiate contractual terms were expensed when determined regardless of overall contract profitability 
under the new policy  pre certification costs  including those in excess of original estimated levels  are included in total contract costs used to evaluate overall contract profitability 
the impact of the changes in accounting method was to record a million after tax gain million before tax gain as a cumulative effect of change in accounting

table of contents credit facilities we have a million committed global syndicated revolving credit facility that expires in may in may  we exercised an option within the credit facility to extend the maturity of the facility by one year from may to may this facility permits borrowing  including letters of credit  up to a maximum of million 
at december   there were million in borrowings  classified as long term debt  and million in letters of credit outstanding under this facility 
at december   there were million in borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under this facility 
the level of unused borrowing capacity under our committed syndicated revolving credit facility varies from time to time depending in part upon our compliance with financial and other covenants set forth in the related agreement  including the consolidated net worth requirement and maximum leverage ratio 
we are currently in compliance with all such covenants 
as of december   we had borrowing capacity under this facility of million  after reductions for borrowings and letters of credit outstanding under the facility 
at december   we maintained million of uncommitted domestic money market facilities and million of uncommitted and committed foreign working capital facilities with various banks to meet short term borrowing requirements 
as of december   there was million outstanding under these facilities 
at december   we maintained million of uncommitted domestic money market facilities and million of uncommitted and committed foreign working capital facilities with million outstanding in borrowings under these facilities 
these credit facilities are provided by a small number of commercial banks that also provide us with committed credit through the syndicated revolving credit facility and with various cash management  trust and other services 
our credit facilities do not contain any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness 
however  a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in the interest rate and fees payable under our committed syndicated revolving credit facility 
such a downgrade also could adversely affect our ability to renew existing or obtain access to new credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of such new facilities 
in may  standard poor s rating services raised our credit rating to bbb from bbb which reduced our facility fee from basis points per annum to basis points per annum 
long term financing at december   we had long term debt and capital lease obligations  including current maturities  of  million with maturities ranging from to long term debt includes million borrowed under the committed revolving syndicated credit facility to facilitate our implementation of the cash repatriation provisions in of the american jobs creation act

as required by a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the issuance of the new notes  on october   we completed exchange offers  registered under the securities act  of notes of the same series in exchange for the outstanding notes due in and notes due in lease agreements we finance some of our office and manufacturing facilities and machinery and equipment  including corporate aircraft  under committed lease arrangements provided by financial institutions 
some of these arrangements allow us to claim a deduction for the tax depreciation on the assets  rather than the lessor  and allow us to lease aircraft and equipment having a maximum unamortized value of million at december  for which million of future minimum lease payments were outstanding under these arrangements 
the other arrangements are standard operating leases 
future minimum lease payments under the standard operating leases approximated million at december  additionally  at december   we had guarantees of residual values of lease obligations of million 
the residual values relate primarily to corporate aircraft which we are obligated to either purchase at the end of the lease term or remarket 
under some of these operating lease agreements  we receive rent holidays  which represent periods of free or reduced rent 
rent holidays are recorded as a liability and recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term 
in addition  we may receive incentives or allowances from the lessor as part of the lease agreement 
we recognize these payments as a liability and amortize them as reductions to lease expense over the lease term 
we capitalize leasehold improvements and amortize them over the shorter of the lease term or the asset s useful life 
sale of receivables effective june   we terminated the variable rate trade receivables securitization program and repaid the outstanding balance of million 
cash flow hedges we have subsidiaries that conduct a substantial portion of their business in euros  great britain pounds sterling  canadian dollars and polish zlotys  but have significant sales contracts that are denominated in us dollars 
approximately of our revenues and approximately of our costs are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
approximately of these net costs are in euros  great britain pounds sterling and canadian dollars 
periodically  we enter into forward contracts to exchange us dollars for euros  great britain pounds sterling  canadian dollars and polish zlotys to hedge a portion of our exposure from us dollar sales 
the forward contracts described above are used to mitigate the potential volatility of earnings and cash flow arising from changes in currency exchange rates that impact our us dollar sales for certain foreign operations 
the forward contracts are being accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the forward contracts are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with the net change in fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of deferred taxes

the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a net liability loss of million at december  other forward contracts as a supplement to the foreign exchange cash flow hedging program  we enter into forward contracts to manage our foreign currency risk related to the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency 
these forward contracts mature monthly and the notional amounts are adjusted periodically to reflect changes in net monetary asset balances 
since these contracts are not designated as hedges  the gains or losses on these forward contracts are recorded in cost of sales 
these contracts are utilized to mitigate the earnings impact of the translation of net monetary assets and liabilities 
under this program  as of december   we had forward contracts with a notional value of million to buy great britain pounds sterling  forward contracts with a notional value of million to buy euros and forward contracts with a notional value of million to buy canadian dollars 
these contracts mature within one month

repurchases under the program  which could aggregate to approximately of our outstanding common stock  may be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions at times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate  subject to market conditions  regulatory requirements and other factors

discontinued operations net cash provided by discontinued operations was million in and million in after tax proceeds of approximately million from the sale of test systems were included in the net cash provided by discontinued operations in contingencies general there are pending or threatened against us or our subsidiaries various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings  arising in the ordinary course of business  including commercial  product liability  asbestos and environmental matters  which seek remedies or damages 
although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of these matters  we believe that any liability that may finally be determined with respect to commercial and non asbestos product liability claims should not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
from time to time  we are also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving tax  contract  patent protection  environmental and other matters 
gain contingencies  if any  are recognized when they are realized 
legal costs are generally expensed when incurred 
environmental we are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations which may require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials 
table of contents at sites associated with past and present operations  including divested sites for which we have contractual obligations relating to the environmental condition of such site 
at certain sites we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under these laws 
estimates of our environmental liabilities are based on currently available facts  present laws and regulations and current technology 
these estimates take into consideration our prior experience in site investigation and remediation  the data concerning cleanup costs available from other companies and regulatory authorities and the professional judgment of our environmental specialists in consultation with outside environmental specialists  when necessary 
estimates of our environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination  the range of remediation alternatives available  evolving remediation standards  imprecise engineering evaluations and estimates of appropriate cleanup technology  methodology and cost  the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties  as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 
accordingly  as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed  it is likely that adjustments in our accruals will be necessary to reflect new information 
the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period  but the amounts  and the possible range of loss in excess of the amounts accrued  are not reasonably estimable 
based on currently available information  however  we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional future developments  administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a given period 
environmental liabilities are recorded when the liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable  which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when we have recommended a remedy or have committed to an appropriate plan of action 
the liabilities are reviewed periodically and  as investigation and remediation proceed  adjustments are made as necessary 
liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value 
the liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties  but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar state managed sites and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites 
our consolidated balance sheet included an accrued liability for environmental remediation obligations of million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  of the accrued liability for environmental remediation was included in current liabilities as accrued expenses 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  was associated with ongoing operations and million and million  respectively  was associated with businesses previously disposed of or discontinued 
the timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors that vary by site  including the nature and extent of contamination  the number of potentially responsible parties  the timing of regulatory approvals  the complexity of the investigation and remediation  and the standards for remediation 
we expect that we will expend present accruals over many years  and will generally complete remediation in less than years at all sites for which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party 
this period includes operation and monitoring costs that are generally incurred over to years 

table of contents asbestos we and a number of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various actions by plaintiffs alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers in products  or which may have been present in our facilities 
a number of these cases involve maritime claims  which have been and are expected to continue to be administratively dismissed by the court 
these actions primarily relate to previously owned businesses 
we believe that pending and reasonably anticipated future actions  net of anticipated insurance recoveries  are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
there can be no assurance  however  that future legislative or other developments will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period 
insurance coverage we believe that we have substantial insurance coverage available to us related to third party claims 
however  the pre primary layer of insurance coverage was provided by the kemper insurance companies kemper 
kemper has indicated that  due to capital constraints and downgrades from various rating agencies  it has ceased underwriting new business and now focuses on administering policy commitments from prior years 
kemper has also indicated that it is currently operating under a run off plan under the supervision of the illinois division of insurance 
we cannot predict the impact of kemper s financial position on the availability of the kemper insurance 
in addition  a portion of our primary and excess layers of pre insurance coverage for third party claims was provided by certain insurance carriers who are either insolvent or undergoing solvent schemes of arrangement 
we have entered into settlement agreements with a number of these insurers pursuant to which we agreed to give up our rights with respect to certain insurance policies in exchange for negotiated payments  some of which are subject to increase under certain circumstances 
these settlements represent negotiated payments for our loss of insurance coverage  as we no longer have insurance available for claims that may have qualified for coverage 
these settlements have been recorded as income for reimbursement of past claim payments under the settled insurance policies and as a deferred settlement credit for future claim payments 
at december   the deferred settlement credit was approximately million for which million is reported in accrued expenses and million was reported in other non current liabilities 
the proceeds from such insurance settlements were reported as a component of net cash provided by operating activities 
liabilities of divested businesses asbestos in may  we completed the tax free spin off of our engineered products eip segment  which at the time of the spin off included enpro industries  inc enpro and coltec industries inc coltec 
at that time  two subsidiaries of coltec were defendants in a significant number of personal injury claims relating to alleged asbestos containing products sold by those subsidiaries 
it is possible that asbestos related claims might be asserted against us on the theory that we have some responsibility for the asbestos related liabilities of enpro  coltec or its subsidiaries  even though the activities that led to those claims occurred prior to our ownership of any of those subsidiaries 
also  it is possible that a claim might be asserted against us that coltec s dividend of its aerospace business to us prior to the spin off was made at a time when coltec was insolvent or caused coltec to become insolvent 
such a claim could seek recovery from us on behalf of coltec of the fair market value of the dividend 

table of contents a limited number of asbestos related claims have been asserted against us as successor to coltec or one of its subsidiaries 
we believe that we have substantial legal defenses against these claims  as well as against any other claims that may be asserted against us on the theories described above 
in addition  the agreement between enpro and us that was used to effectuate the spin off provides us with an indemnification from enpro covering  among other things  these liabilities 
the success of any such asbestos related claims would likely require  as a practical matter  that coltec s subsidiaries were unable to satisfy their asbestos related liabilities and that coltec was found to be responsible for these liabilities and was unable to meet its financial obligations 
we believe any such claims would be without merit and that coltec was solvent both before and after the dividend of its aerospace business to us 
if we are ultimately found to be responsible for the asbestos related liabilities of coltec s subsidiaries  we believe such finding would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  but could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in a particular period 
however  because of the uncertainty as to the number  timing and payments related to future asbestos related claims  there can be no assurance that any such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if a claim related to the dividend of coltec s aerospace business were successful  it could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
other in connection with the divestiture of our tire  vinyl and other businesses  we have received contractual rights of indemnification from third parties for environmental and other claims arising out of the divested businesses 
failure of these third parties to honor their indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
guarantees at december   we had an outstanding contingent liability for guarantees of debt and lease payments of million  letters of credit and bank guarantees of million and residual value of lease obligations of million 
see note  lease commitments and note  financing arrangements to our consolidated financial statements 
aerostructures long term contracts our aerostructures business has several long term contracts in the pre production and early production phases eg  boeing  airbus a and a xwb 
the pre production phase includes design of the product to meet customer specifications as well as design of the manufacturing processes to manufacture the product 
also involved in this phase is securing supply of material and subcomponents produced by third party suppliers that are generally accomplished through long term supply agreements 
in addition to these factors  contracts in the early production phase include excess over average inventories  which represent the excess of current manufactured cost over the estimated average manufactured cost over the life of the contract 
cost estimates over the life of the contract are affected by estimates of future cost reductions including learning curve efficiencies 
because these contracts cover periods of up to years or more  there is risk that estimates of future costs made during the pre production and early production phases will be different from actual costs and that difference could be significant

differences between the reserves for tax contingencies and the amounts ultimately owed by us are recorded in the period they become known 
adjustments to our reserves could have a material effect on our financial statements 
as of december   we had recorded tax contingency reserves of approximately million 
in  coltec  a former goodrich subsidiary  paid million to the irs 
this payment represented the tax and accrued interest arising out of the irs s disallowance of a capital loss and certain tax credits relating to coltec s tax year 
on february   coltec filed suit against the us government in the us court of federal claims for a refund of this payment 
the case went to trial  and on november   the trial court ruled in favor of coltec 
during  the government appealed the decision to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit 
the appeals court reversed the decision of the trial court on july  on august   we paid the tax and accrued interest relating to subsequent years of approximately million to the irs 
on november   coltec filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the supreme court of the united states asking the court to review the decision of the appeals court 
on february  the supreme court of the united states denied coltec s petition

rohr filed petitions in the us tax court opposing the proposed assessments 
we previously reached a tentative settlement agreement with the irs with regard to the proposed assessments that required further review by the joint committee on taxation jct 
on march  we received notification that the jct approved the tentative settlement agreement entered into with the irs 
as a result of receiving the jct notification we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million primarily related to the reversal of the tax reserves during our current irs examination cycle began on september  and involves the taxable years ended december  through december  based on communications with the irs exam team  we expect field examination of the current cycle to be completed during the prior examination cycle which began in march  includes the consolidated income tax groups in the audit periods identified below rohr  inc and subsidiaries july  december  through date of acquisition coltec industries inc and subsidiaries december  july  through date of acquisition goodrich corporation and subsidiaries including rohr and coltec there were numerous tax issues that had been raised by the irs as part of the prior examination cycle  including  but not limited to  transfer pricing  research and development credits  foreign tax credits  tax accounting for long term contracts  tax accounting for inventory  tax accounting for stock options  depreciation  amortization and the proper timing for certain other deductions for income tax purposes 
we previously reached tentative settlement agreements with the irs on substantially all of the issues raised with respect to the prior examination cycle 
due to the amounts of tax involved certain portions of the tentative settlement agreements were required 
table of contents to be reviewed by the jct 
we received notification on april  that the jct approved the tentative settlement agreement entered into with the irs with regard to rohr  inc and subsidiaries for the period from july  through december  
as a result of receiving the jct notification  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million  primarily related to the reversal of tax reserves  during in addition to the jct approvals with regard to rohr  we reached agreement with the irs regarding most of the issues with respect to coltec industries inc and subsidiaries for the period from december  through july  
consequently  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million  primarily related to the reversal of tax reserves in during  we reached final settlement with the irs on substantially all of the issues relating to the goodrich corporation and subsidiaries examination cycle 
as a result  we recorded a benefit of approximately million  primarily related to the reversal of tax reserves 
we anticipate filing a petition with the us tax court to contest the remaining unresolved issues which involve the proper timing of certain deductions

rohr has been under examination by the state of california for the tax years ended july   and the state of california has disallowed certain expenses incurred by one of rohr s subsidiaries in connection with the lease of certain tangible property 
california s franchise tax board held that the deductions associated with the leased equipment were non business deductions 
the additional tax associated with the franchise tax board s position is approximately million 
the amount of accrued interest associated with the additional tax is approximately million as of december  in addition  the state of california enacted an amnesty provision that imposes nondeductible penalty interest equal to of the unpaid interest amounts relating to taxable years ended before the penalty interest is approximately million as of december  the tax and interest amounts continue to be contested by rohr 
we believe that we are adequately reserved for this contingency 
during  rohr made payments of approximately million million for tax and million for interest related to items that were not being contested and approximately million related to items that are being contested 
no payment has been made for the million of interest or million of penalty interest 
under california law  rohr may be required to pay the full amount of interest prior to filing any suit for refund

 postretirement benefits associated with split dollar life insurance eitf 
eitf requires deferred compensation or postretirement benefit aspects of an endorsement type split dollar life insurance arrangement to be recognized as a liability by the employer and the obligation is not effectively settled by the purchase of a life insurance policy 
the liability for future benefits should be recognized based on the substantive agreement with the employee  which may be either to provide a future death benefit or to pay for the future cost of the life insurance 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of eitf on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing obligations  warranty obligations  excess component order cancellation costs  restructuring  long term service contracts  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
contract accounting percentage of completion revenue recognition we have sales under long term contracts  many of which contain escalation clauses  requiring delivery of products over several years and frequently providing the buyer with option pricing on follow on orders 
sales and profits on each contract are recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting  primarily using the units of delivery method 
we follow the requirements of statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts the contract method of accounting  using the cumulative catch up method in accounting for revisions in estimates 
under the cumulative catch up method  the impact of revisions in estimates related to units shipped to date is recognized immediately when changes in estimated contract profitability are known 
estimates of revenue and cost for our contracts span a period of many years from the inception of the contracts to the date of actual shipments and are based on a substantial number of underlying assumptions 
we believe that the underlying factors are sufficiently reliable to provide a reasonable estimate of the profit to be generated 
however  due to the significant length of time over which revenue streams will be generated  the variability of the assumptions 
table of contents of the revenue and cost streams can be significant if the factors change 
the factors include but are not limited to estimates of the following projected number of units to be delivered under the contracts  escalation of future sales prices under the contracts  costs  including material and labor costs and related escalation  labor improvements due to the learning curve experience  and supplier pricing including escalation where applicable 
inventory inventoried costs on long term contracts include certain pre production costs  consisting primarily of tooling and design costs and production costs  including applicable overhead 
the costs attributed to units delivered under long term commercial contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced and are determined under the learning curve concept  which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition 
during the early years of a contract  manufacturing costs per unit delivered are typically greater than the estimated average unit cost for the total contract 
this excess manufacturing cost for units shipped results in an increase in inventory referred to as excess over average during the early years of a contract 
if in process inventory plus estimated costs to complete a specific contract exceeds the anticipated remaining sales value of such contract  such excess is charged to cost of sales in the period recognized  thus reducing inventory to estimated realizable value 
income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting principles board opinion no 
 interim financial reporting and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for income taxes in interim periods  as of each reporting period  we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
the estimate of our effective income tax rate involves significant judgments regarding the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions and estimates as to the amount and jurisdictional source of income expected to be earned during the full fiscal year 
further influencing this estimate are evolving interpretations of new and existing tax laws  rulings by taxing authorities and court decisions 
due to the subjective and complex nature of these underlying issues  our actual effective tax rate and related tax liabilities may differ from our initial estimates 
differences between our estimated and actual effective income tax rates and related liabilities are recorded in the period they become known 
the resulting adjustment to our income tax expense could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period the adjustment is recorded 
in accordance with sfas  we record tax contingencies when the exposure item becomes probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
as of december  and  we had recorded tax contingency reserves of approximately million and million  respectively 
in accordance with sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for tax carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes are measured using enacted tax laws and rates 
a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 

table of contents identifiable intangible assets impairments of identifiable intangible assets are recognized when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset  or related groups of assets  may not be recoverable and our estimate of undiscounted cash flows over the assets remaining useful lives is less than the carrying value of the assets 
the determination of undiscounted cash flow is based on our segments plans 
the revenue growth is based upon aircraft build projections from aircraft manufacturers and widely available external publications 
the profit margin assumption is based upon the current cost structure and anticipated cost reductions 
changes to these assumptions could result in the recognition of impairment 
participation payments certain of our businesses make cash payments under long term contractual arrangements to oe manufacturers oem or system contractors in return for a secured position on an aircraft program 
participation payments are capitalized  when a contractual liability has been incurred  as other assets and amortized as cost of sales 
the carrying amount of participation payments is evaluated for recovery at least annually or when other indicators of impairment  such as a change in the estimated number of units or a revision in the economics of the program 
if such estimates change  amortization expense is adjusted and or an impairment charge is recorded  as appropriate  for the effect of the revised estimates 
entry fees certain businesses in our engine systems segment make cash payments to an oem under long term contractual arrangements related to new engine programs 
the payments are referred to as entry fees and entitle us to a controlled access supply contract and a percentage of total program revenue generated by the oem 
entry fees are capitalized in other assets and are amortized on a straight line basis to cost of sales or as a reduction of sales  as appropriate 
the carrying amount of entry fees is evaluated for recovery at least annually or when other significant assumptions or economic conditions change 
recovery of entry fees is assessed based on the expected cash flow from the program over the remaining program life as compared to the recorded amount of entry fees 
if the carrying value of the entry fees exceeds the cash flow to be generated from the program  a charge would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount of the entry fee exceeds its fair value 
as with any investment  there are risks inherent in recovering the value of entry fees 
such risks are consistent with the risks associated in acquiring a revenue producing asset in which market conditions may change or the risks that arise when a manufacturer of a product on which a royalty is based has business difficulties and cannot produce the product 
such risks include but are not limited to the following changes in market conditions that may affect product sales under the program  including market acceptance and competition from others  performance of subcontract suppliers and other production risks  bankruptcy or other less significant financial difficulties of other program participants  including the aircraft manufacturer  the oem and other program suppliers or the aircraft customer  and availability of specialized raw materials in the marketplace 
sales incentives we offer sales incentives such as up front cash payments  merchandise credits and or free products to certain airline customers in connection with sales contracts 
the cost of these 
table of contents incentives is recognized in the period incurred unless recovery of these costs is specifically guaranteed by the customer in the contract 
if the contract contains such a guarantee  then the cost of the sales incentive is capitalized as other assets and amortized to cost of sales 
the carrying amount of sales incentives is evaluated for recovery when indicators of potential impairment exist 
the carrying value of the sales incentives is also compared annually to the amount recoverable under the terms of the guarantee in the customer contract 
if the amount of the carrying value of the sales incentives exceeds the amount recoverable in the contract  the carrying value is reduced 
flight certification costs when a supply arrangement is secured  certain of our businesses may agree to supply hardware to an oem to be used in flight certification testing and or make cash payments to reimburse an oem for costs incurred in testing the hardware 
the flight certification testing is necessary to certify aircraft systems components for the aircraft s airworthiness and allows the aircraft to be flown and thus sold in the country certifying the aircraft 
flight certification costs are capitalized in other assets and are amortized to cost of sales 
the carrying amount of flight certification costs is evaluated for recovery when indicators of impairment exist or when the estimated number of units to be manufactured changes 
service and product warranties we provide service and warranty policies on certain of our products 
we accrue liabilities under service and warranty policies based upon specific claims and a review of historical warranty and service claim experience in accordance with sfas adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience change 
in addition  we incur discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues 
our service and product warranty reserves are based upon a variety of factors 
any significant change in these factors could have a material impact on our results of operations 
such factors include but are not limited to the following the historical performance of our products and changes in performance of newer products  the mix and volumes of products being sold  and the impact of product changes 
pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions we consult with an outside actuary as to the appropriateness for many of the assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the annual expense for our pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions 
assumptions such as the rate of compensation increase and the long term rate of return on plan assets are based upon our historical and benchmark data  as well as our outlook for the future 
health care cost projections and the mortality rate assumption are evaluated annually 
for december  the us discount rate was determined based on a customized yield curve approach 
our projected pension and postretirement benefit payment cash flows were each plotted against a yield curve composed of a large  diverse group of aa rated corporate bonds 
the resulting discount rate was used to determine the benefit obligations as of december  this same approach was used to determine us discount rates to use to remeasure plan obligations on april   in connection with our definitive agreement to divest the turbomachinery products business which agreement was subsequently terminated  on may  and due to the closure of the election period for the retirement choice program 
in the uk and canada  a similar approach to determining discount rates in the us is utilized 
this is a change in methodology for setting the uk discount rate  
table of contents which was based on the iboxx aa long term high quality bond rate as of december  the appropriate benchmarks by applicable country were used for pension plans other than those in the us  us  and canada to determine the discount rate assumptions 
sensitivity analysis the table below quantifies the approximate impact of a one quarter percentage point change in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets for our pension plan cost and liability holding all other assumptions constant 
the discount rate assumption is selected each year based on market conditions in effect as of the disclosure date 
the rate selected is used to measure liabilities as of the disclosure date and for calculating the following year s pension expense 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption  although reviewed each year  is changed less frequently due to the long term nature of the assumption 
this assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of disclosure date  rather  it is used only in the calculation of pension expense

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and 
table of contents other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we use such derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
see note  derivatives and hedging activities in our consolidated financial statements for a description of current developments involving our hedging activities 
we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our outstanding variable rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
at december   a hypothetical basis point unfavorable change in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
we enter into interest rate swaps to increase our exposure to variable interest rates 
we have the following interest rate swaps outstanding as of december  a million fixed to floating interest rate swap on the notes due in  two million fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the notes due in  and a million fixed to floating interest rate swap on the notes due in in september  we entered into a million fixed to floating interest rate swap on our senior notes due in the settlement and maturity dates on the swap are the same as those on the referenced notes 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the interest rate swap is being accounted for as a fair value hedge and the carrying value of the notes has been adjusted to reflect the fair value of the interest rate swap 
the table represents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates excluding the receivables securitization program 
also included is information about our interest rate swaps 
expected maturity dates fair debt thereafter total value dollars in millions debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate capital lease obligations interest rate swaps fixed to variable notional value loss average pay rate average receive rate foreign currency exposure we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations 
these risks include transactions denominated in foreign currencies  the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency and translation 
table of contents of income and expense and balance sheet amounts of our foreign subsidiaries to the us dollar 
our objective is to minimize our exposure to transaction and income risks through our normal operating activities and  where appropriate  through foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
foreign exchange negatively impacted our business segments financial results in approximately of our revenues and approximately of our costs are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
over of these net costs are in euros  great britain pounds sterling and canadian dollars 
we hedge a portion of our exposure of us dollar sales on an ongoing basis 
as currency exchange rates fluctuate  translation of the statements of income of international businesses into us dollars will affect comparability of revenues and expenses between years 
we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to sell us dollars for great britain pounds sterling  canadian dollars  euros and polish zlotys 
these forward contracts are used to mitigate a portion of the potential volatility to earnings and cash flows arising from changes in currency exchange rates 
as of december  we had forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million to buy great britain pounds sterling  forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million to buy canadian dollars  forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million to buy euros and forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million to buy polish zlotys 
these forward contracts mature on a monthly basis with maturity dates that range from january to december at december   a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies would decrease the value of the forward contracts described above by million 
the fair value of these forward contracts was million at december  because we hedge only a portion of our exposure  a strengthening of the us dollar as described above would have a more than offsetting benefit to our financial results in future periods 
in addition to the foreign exchange cash flow hedges  we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk related to the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency 
these forward contracts mature monthly and the notional amounts are adjusted periodically to reflect changes in net monetary asset balances 
as of december   we had forward contracts with a notional value of million to buy great britain pounds sterling  forward contracts with a notional value of million to buy euros and forward contracts with a notional value of million to buy canadian dollars
