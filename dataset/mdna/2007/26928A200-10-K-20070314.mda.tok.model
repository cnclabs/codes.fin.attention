risk factors of this report 
the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading global medical device company focused on catheter based technologies for the endovascular treatment of vascular diseases and disorders 
our name signifies our commitment to  and engagement in  the peripheral vascular  neurovascular and cardiovascular markets and the physician specialties that serve them 
our broad product portfolio is focused on applications that we estimate represent an addressable worldwide endovascular market opportunity of approximately billion in and up to billion by the end of we sell over products consisting of over  skus in more than countries through a direct sales force in the united states  canada  europe and other countries and distributors in selected other international markets 
from to  our investor group acquired certain of the assets in our cardio peripheral division to build the foundation of our current peripheral and cardiovascular product portfolios 
during this period  our investor group also purchased certain neurovascular assets to expand our neurovascular product portfolio and  through a series of investments  obtained a controlling investment in micro therapeutics  inc  or mti 
prior to  mti was our majority owned subsidiary  with the remaining shares being publicly held 
in january  we acquired the remaining shares of mti s common stock not owned by us  as a result of which mti became our wholly owned subsidiary 
we have dedicated significant capital and management effort to advance our acquired technologies and broaden our product lines in order to execute our strategies 
we believe the overall market for endovascular devices will grow as the demand for minimally invasive treatment of vascular diseases and disorders continues to increase 
we intend to capitalize on this market opportunity by the continued introduction of new products 
we expect to originate these new products primarily through our internal research and development and clinical efforts  but we may supplement them with acquisitions or other external collaborations 
additionally  our growth has been  and will continue to be  impacted by our expansion into new geographic markets and the expansion of our direct sales organization in existing geographic markets 
we were formed on january  as a subsidiary of ev llc 
immediately prior to the consummation of our initial public offering on june   ev llc was merged with and into us and we completed a one for six reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock 
for additional information regarding our formation and the related transactions  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
all share and per share amounts for all periods presented in this report reflect the reverse stock split of our common stock 
we report and manage our operations in two reportable business segments based on similarities in the products sold  customer base and distribution system 
our cardio peripheral segment contains products that are used in both peripheral vascular and cardiovascular procedures by radiologists  vascular surgeons and cardiologists 
our neurovascular segment contains products that are used primarily by neuroradiologists and neuro surgeons 
our sales activities and operations are aligned closely with our business segments 
we generally have dedicated cardio peripheral sales teams in the united states and europe that target customers who often perform procedures in both anatomic areas cardiovascular and peripheral vascular 
we generally have separate  dedicated neurovascular sales teams in the united states and europe that are specifically focused on our neurovascular business customer base 
we have corporate infrastructure and direct sales capabilities in the united states  canada  europe and other countries and have established distribution relationships in selected other international markets 
beginning october   we established a distribution arrangement with medtronic international trading inc japan branch  a subsidiary of medtronic  inc  pursuant to which medtronic distributes all of our products in japan 
as a result of this new arrangement  we ceased our direct sales operations in japan 
our corporate headquarters and our manufacturing  research and development  and us sales operations for our peripheral vascular and cardiovascular product lines are located in plymouth  minnesota 
our manufacturing  research and development  and us sales operations for our neurovascular product lines are located in irvine  california 
outside of the united states  our primary office is in paris  france 
approximately and of our net sales during and  respectively  were generated outside of the united states  as a result of which we are sensitive to risks related to fluctuation in exchange rates and other risks associated with international operations  which could affect our business results 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact of approximately thousand on our net sales as compared to our net sales 
since our inception  we have focused on building our us and international direct sales and marketing infrastructure that includes a worldwide sales force of approximately sales professionals as of december  in the united states  canada and europe 
our direct sales representatives accounted for approximately of our net sales during and  with the balance generated by independent distributors 
in order to drive sales growth  we have invested heavily throughout our history in new product development  clinical trials to obtain regulatory approvals and the expansion of our global distribution system 
as a result  our cumulative costs and expenses have significantly exceeded our net sales  resulting in an accumulated deficit of million at december  consequently  we have financed our operations through debt and equity offerings 
we expect to continue to generate operating losses for at least the next months 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments available to fund our current operations were million at december  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock on june  in which we sold  shares of our common stock at per share  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
we used million of these net proceeds to repay a portion of the accrued and unpaid interest on certain demand notes held by warburg  pincus equity partners  lp and certain of its affiliates  which we refer to collectively as warburg pincus  and the vertical group  lp and certain of its affiliates  which we refer to collectively as the vertical group 
in addition  on july   we sold  shares of common stock pursuant to an over allotment option granted to the underwriters which resulted in net proceeds to us of million  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
we invested the remaining portion of the net proceeds in short term  investment grade  interest bearing securities 
we have used these funds for general corporate purposes since our initial public offering  and expect to continue to do so 
we expect our cash balances to decrease as we continue to use cash to fund our operations  until the fourth quarter of at which time we expect to generate a positive cash flow 
on june   our operating subsidiaries  ev endovascular  inc  ev international  inc and ev neurovascular  entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank  consisting of a two year million revolving line of credit and a month million equipment financing line 
as of december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under the equipment line and no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit  however  we had approximately million of outstanding letters of credit issued by svb  which reduces the amount available under our revolving line of credit to approximately million 
we believe our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and funds available under our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months 
sales and expense components the following is a description of the primary components of our net sales and expenses net sales 
we derive our net sales from the sale of endovascular devices in two primary business segments cardio peripheral and neurovascular devices 
most of our sales are generated by our global  direct sales force and are shipped and billed to hospitals or clinics throughout the world 
in countries where we do not have a direct sales force  sales are generated by shipments to distributors who  in turn  sell to hospitals and clinics 
in cases where our products are held in consignment at a customer s location  we generate sales at the time the product is used in surgery and we are notified by the hospital  rather than at shipment 
we charge our customers for shipping and record shipping income as part of net sales 
cost of goods sold 
we manufacture a substantial majority of the products that we sell 
our cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  raw materials  components and royalties and excludes amortization of intangible assets  which is presented as a separate component of operating expenses 
sales  general and administrative expenses 
our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales commissions and support costs for our global  direct distribution system and consulting expenses associated with our medical advisors  marketing costs and freight expense that we pay to ship products to customers 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  compliance systems  accounting  finance  legal  information technology  human resources and facility costs  including any costs related to closing facilities 
research and development 
research and development expense includes costs associated with the design  development  testing  deployment  enhancement and regulatory approval of our products 
it also includes costs associated with design and execution of clinical trials and regulatory submissions 
amortization of intangible assets 
intangible assets  such as purchased completed technology  distribution channels  intellectual property  including trademarks and patents  are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from to years 
gain loss on sale of assets  net 
gain loss on sale of assets  net  includes the difference between the proceeds received from the sale of an operating asset and its carrying value 
acquired in process research and development 
acquired in process research and development is related to value assigned to those projects acquired in business combinations or in the acquisition of assets for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 
gain on sale or disposal of investments  net 
gain on sale or disposal of investments  net  includes the difference between the proceeds received from the sale of an investment and its carrying value 
in addition  this caption includes losses from other than temporary declines in investments accounted for on a cost basis 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net  consists primarily of interest associated with loans from silicon valley bank and  prior to our initial public offering  from our principal investors  warburg pincus and the vertical group 
interest income results from interest earned on investments in investment grade  interest bearing securities and money market accounts 
minority interest in loss of subsidiary 
minority interest in loss of subsidiary is the portion of mti net losses allocated to minority stockholders 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net primarily includes foreign exchange gains losses net of certain other expenses 
income tax expense 
income tax expense is generated in certain of our european subsidiaries 
due to our history of operating losses  we have not recorded tax benefits for us income taxes through accretion of preferred membership units to redemption value 
accretion of preferred membership units to redemption value represents the increase in carrying value of preferred membership units of ev llc prior to ev llc s merger with and into us on june  the increase in carrying value was based on the rights to which the preferred membership units were entitled related to a liquidation  dissolution or winding up of ev llc 
accretion was recorded as a reduction to members equity and increased the loss attributable to common unit holders 
accretion was discontinued upon conversion of the preferred units to common equity at the time of our initial public offering on june  results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts in thousands  and the changes between the specified periods expressed as percent increases or decreases for the year ended december  for the year ended december  results of operations percent change percent change net sales operating expenses cost of goods sold sales  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangible assets gain loss on sale of assets  net nm nm acquired in process research and development nm nm total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense gain on sale of investments  net interest income expense  net nm minority interest in loss of subsidiary nm nm other income expense  net nm nm loss before income taxes income tax expense net loss accretion of preferred membership units to redemption value nm nm net loss attributable to common share unit holders the accretion of preferred membership units to redemption value presented above is based on the rights to which the class a and class b preferred membership unit holders of ev llc were entitled related to a liquidation  dissolution or winding up of ev llc 
notwithstanding this accretion right  in connection with the merger of ev llc with and into us  each membership unit representing a preferred equity interest in ev llc was converted into the right to receive one share of our common stock and did not receive any additional rights with respect to the liquidation preference

net sales increased to million in compared to million in  primarily as a result of new product introductions and the market penetration of products introduced in the past months 
net sales of cardio peripheral products 
net sales of cardio peripheral products increased to million in compared to million in key new product launches that contributed to the sales increase for the year ended december  included the prot g everflex stents  and the spiderx embolic protection device  both of which were approved by the us fda during the first quarter of this sales growth was also driven by increased market penetration of our prot g family of self expanding stents and sales of our pta balloon catheters in the united states 
net sales in our stent product line increased to million in compared to million in this increase is attributable to increased market penetration of everflex  prot g gps  primus and paramount mini families of stents  partially offset by sales declines in older generation products 
net sales of our thrombectomy and embolic protection devices increased to million in largely due to the introduction of the spiderx in the us and continued market penetration internationally  partially offset by sales declines in older generation products 
net sales of our procedural support and other products increased to million in compared to  largely due to increased market penetration of pta balloon catheters in the united states 
we believe that our stent and embolic protection sales will continue to lead the growth in our cardio peripheral segment 
we expect our cardio peripheral net sales to increase in as a result of market growth  further market penetration by products launched during and  as well as the introduction of new products during net sales of neurovascular products 
net sales of our neurovascular products increased to million in compared to million in  primarily as a result of increased market penetration of the onyx liquid embolic system and nexus coils  as well as continued penetration by our microcatheters and occlusion balloon systems 
sales of our embolic products increased to million in compared to primarily due increased market penetration of the onyx liquid embolics for the treatment of brain avms since its united states launch in july  volume increases in the onyx liquid embolics internationally and volume increases in the nexus family of embolic coils 
sales of our neuro access and delivery products increased to million in compared to largely as a result of volume increases across multiple product lines  including the echelon microcatheters and the hyperform and hyperglide occlusion balloon systems 
we expect our neurovascular sales to increase in due to market growth  additional market penetration by products launched during and  and the introduction of new products during net sales by geography 
net sales in the united states increased to million in compared to million in international sales increased to million in compared to million in and represented of company wide sales in compared to in international sales include a favorable currency impact of approximately thousand compared to  principally resulting from the performance of the euro against the us dollar 
our direct sales force operations in europe produced net sales of million which represented of the total international net sales growth  with the remainder coming from our distribution operations in the asia pacific  canada  latin america and middle east markets 
the sales growth in our international markets was primarily a result of new product introductions and increased product penetration 
cost of goods sold 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased to of net sales in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to our continued growth in sales volume  ongoing investments in in house manufacturing capabilities and cost savings achieved related to facility consolidation and our implementation and use of lean manufacturing concepts 
in our cardio peripheral segment  cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales decreased to in year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  primarily attributable to on going investments in in house manufacturing capabilities  facility consolidation and increased sales volume 
in our neurovascular segment  cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales decreased to in year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  due in part to the consolidation of our neurovascular manufacturing operations into our irvine  california facility during the second quarter of our increased production volumes and on going cost savings programs also contributed to the decrease 
we expect cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales to continue to decline during due to higher volume in our manufacturing facilities and efficiency improvements from manufacturing initiatives  offset in part by royalty payments required under the license agreement with medtronic and anticipated conversion costs associated with new product launches occurring during sales  general and administrative expense 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in the increase was due to a million increase in non cash stock based compensation costs  increased international distribution costs of million related to rent and freight costs  increases in general staffing levels and higher selling expenses related to the expansion of our neurovascular sales force 
new product introductions also contributed to the increase in the year ended december  although these expenses increased in absolute dollars  as a percentage of net sales  sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to in compared to of net sales in we expect sales  general and administrative expenses to increase in total when compared to but continue to decline as a percentage of net sales as we believe that our current infrastructure can support a higher level of sales 
research and development 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development expense decreased to for the year ended december  compared to in this reduction was due to the increase in net sales combined with a decrease in clinical study expenses related to the completion of certain clinical trials in the decrease in clinical costs was partially offset by increased spending on certain internal development efforts 
we expect research and development spending to increase in as we have multiple clinical trials planned for amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily a result of additional amortizable intangible assets recorded as part of our acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares of mti in january we expect the amortization of intangibles assets in to remain consistent with levels 
acquired in process research and development 
during  we incurred a charge of million for acquired in process research and development as a result of our acquisition of the outstanding shares of mti that we did not already own 
during  we incurred a charge of thousand for acquired in process research and development as a result of the vertical group s contribution to ev llc of shares of mti 
this contribution was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting based upon the proportionate ownership contributed to ev llc

financing history 
we have generated significant operating losses since our inception

we used million of these net proceeds to repay a portion of the accrued and unpaid interest on certain demand notes held by warburg pincus and vertical 
in addition  on july   we sold  shares of common stock pursuant to an over allotment option granted to the underwriters which resulted in net proceeds to us of million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses

we have used these funds for general corporate purposes since our initial public offering and expect to continue to do so 
see part ii  item under the heading use of proceeds included elsewhere in this report 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments available to fund current operations were million and million at december  and  respectively

credit facility 
on june   our operating subsidiaries  ev endovascular  inc  ev international  inc 
and micro therapeutics  inc  which we refer to as the borrowers  entered into a loan and security agreement  which we refer to as the loan agreement  with silicon valley bank  or svb  consisting of a two year million revolving line of credit and a month million equipment financing line 
pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement and subject to specified reserves  we may borrow under the revolving line of credit up to million without any borrowing base limitations 
aggregate borrowings under the revolving line of credit that exceed million will subject the revolving line to borrowing base limitations 
these limitations allow us to borrow  subject to specified reserves  up to of eligible domestic and foreign accounts receivables plus up to of eligible inventory 
additionally  borrowings against the eligible inventory may not exceed the lesser of of the amount advanced against accounts receivable or million 
borrowings under the revolving line bear interest at a variable rate equal to svb s prime rate 
borrowings under the equipment line bear interest at a variable rate equal to svb s prime rate plus 
accrued interest on any outstanding balance under the revolving line is payable monthly in arrears 
amounts outstanding under the equipment line as of december  are payable in consecutive equal monthly installments of principal  beginning on january  as of december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under the equipment line and no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit  however  we had approximately million of outstanding letters of credit issued by svb  which reduces the amount available under our revolving line of credit to approximately million 
both the revolving line of credit and equipment financing are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets  excluding intellectual property  which is subject to a negative pledge  and are guaranteed by us 
and all of our domestic direct and indirect subsidiaries 
the loan agreement requires the borrowers to maintain a specified liquidity ratio and a tangible net worth level 
the loan agreement imposes certain limitations on the borrowers  their subsidiaries and us  including without limitation  limitations on their ability to i transfer all or any part of their business or properties  ii permit or suffer a change in control  iii merge or consolidate  or acquire any entity  iv engage in any material new line of business  v incur additional indebtedness or liens with respect to any of their properties  vi pay dividends or make any other distribution on or purchase of  any of their capital stock  vii make investments in other companies  or viii engage in related party transactions  subject in each case to certain exceptions and limitations 
the loan agreement requires us to maintain on deposit or invested with svb or its affiliates the lesser of million or of our aggregate cash and cash equivalents 
the borrowers are required to pay customary fees with respect to the facility  including a fee on the average unused portion of the revolving line 
the loan agreement contains customary events of default  including the failure to make required payments  the failure to comply with certain covenants or other agreements  the occurrence of a material adverse change  failure to pay certain other indebtedness and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency 
upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default  amounts due under the loan agreement may be accelerated 
we believe our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and funds available under our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next months 
operating activities 
cash used in operations during the year ended december  was million compared to million in  reflecting primarily our net loss and increased working capital requirements during both periods 
in  our net loss included approximately million of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  acquired in process research and development and stock based compensation expense as compared with million in we expect that operations will continue to use cash during the first nine months of investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
during we purchased property and equipment totaling million  patents and licenses totaling million and of short term investments totaling million 
these cash payments were partially offset by proceeds from short term investments and proceeds from the sale of investments in during  we purchased property and equipment totaling million and short term investments totaling million 
we also made a milestone payment related to a previous acquisition in the amount of million and incurred million in merger related costs 
these cash payments in were partially offset by the receipt of million from the sale of certain assets by genyx medical  inc  in which mti held a minority interest  the receipt of a thousand milestone payment related to the sales of an investment in enteric medical technologies  inc and the receipt of million related to the return of acquisition consideration resulting from a settlement of an acquisition dispute 
historically  our capital expenditures have consisted of purchased manufacturing equipment  research and testing equipment  computer systems and office furniture and equipment 
we expect to continue to make investments in property and equipment and to incur approximately million in capital expenditures during financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december  generated primarily from proceeds of stock option exercises and proceeds from borrowings on our equipment term loan with silicon valley bank 
during  cash provided by financing activities was million and consisted of million of net proceeds received from our initial public offering of our common stock  inclusive of the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option on july   and proceeds of million from the issuance of demand notes 
other liquidity information 
the acquisition agreements relating to our purchase of mitralife  appriva medical  inc and dendron gmbh require us to make additional payments to the sellers of these businesses if certain milestones related to regulatory steps in the product commercialization process are achieved 
the potential milestone payments total million  million and million with respect to the mitralife  appriva and dendron acquisitions  respectively  during the period of to we do not believe it is likely that we will have obligations with respect to the mitralife milestones in the future 
we have determined that the first milestone with respect to the appriva agreement was not achieved by the january  milestone date and that the first milestone is not payable 
on september   we announced that we had decided to discontinue the development and commercialization of our plaato device  which is the technology we acquired in the appriva transaction 
although we recently had obtained conditional approval from the fda for an investigational device exemption ide clinical trial for the plaato device  we determined that  due to the time  cost and risk of enrollment  the trial design ultimately mandated by the fda was not commercially feasible for us at such time 
we continue to keep all of our options open with regard to the future of the plaato technology  which may include a sale or licensing of the technology to third parties 
under the terms of the stock purchase agreement we entered into in connection with our acquisition of dendron  we may be required to make additional payments which are contingent upon dendron products achieving certain revenue targets between and in  the million revenue target for sales of dendron products during was met 
accordingly  an additional payment to the former dendron stockholders of million was made in in  the million revenue target for sales of dendron products during was met 
accordingly  a payment to the former dendron stockholders of million was accrued in and was paid during the second quarter we may be required to make a final payment of million  which is contingent upon dendron products achieving annual revenues of million in any year during the period between and any such final payment would be due in the year following the year of target achievement 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors  including the extent and duration of future operating losses  the level and timing of future sales and expenditures  the results and scope of ongoing research and product development programs  working capital to support our sales growth  receipt of and time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals  sales and marketing programs  continuing acceptance of our products in the marketplace competing technologies  market and regulatory developments  and the future course of intellectual property litigation 
we believe that the resources generated from our initial public offering  together with funds available under our revolving credit facility  are sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next months 
in the event that we require additional working capital to fund future operations and any future acquisitions  we may negotiate a financing arrangement with an independent institutional lender  sell notes to public or private investors or sell additional shares of stock or other equity securities 
there is no assurance that any financing transaction will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all  or that any financing transaction will not be dilutive to our current stockholders 
if we require additional working capital  but are not able to raise additional funds  we may be required to significantly curtail or cease ongoing operations 
from time to time  we may also sell a given technology or intellectual property having a development timeline or development cost that is inconsistent with our investment horizon or which does not adequately complement our existing product portfolio 
see item legal proceedings and note and note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
our most significant accounting policies are described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  sales returns and discounts  and income taxes are updated as appropriate 
certain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our physician customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
different  reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
we believe that the following financial estimates are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accounting firm 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements 
those financial estimates include revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before sales can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these criteria are met at the time of shipment when risk of loss and title passes to the customer or distributor  unless a consignment arrangement exists 
sales from consignment arrangements are recognized upon written acknowledgement that the product has been used by the customer indicating that a sale is complete 
our terms of sale for regular sales are typically fob shipping point  net days 
regular sales include orders from customers for replacement of customer stock  replenishment of consignment product used by customers  orders for a scheduled case surgery and stocking orders 
we allow customers to return defective or damaged products for credit 
our estimate for sales returns is based upon contractual commitments and historical return experience which we analyze by geography and is recorded as a reduction of sales for the period in which the related sales occurred 
historically  our return experience has been low with return rates of less than of our net sales 
stock based compensation we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and other equity incentive awards 
the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables which include the expected life of the award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the awards  expected dividend yield  risk free interest rate and the forfeiture rate 
we estimate the expected term of options based upon our historical experience 
we estimate expected volatility and forfeiture rates based on a combination of historical factors related to our common stock since our june initial public offering and the volatility rates of a set of guideline companies 
the guideline companies consist of public and recently public medical technology companies 
the risk free interest rate is determined using us treasury rates appropriate for the expected term 
dividend yield is estimated to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no plans of doing so in the future 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
generally  all stock based compensation is amortized on a straight line basis over the respective requisite service periods  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our results of operations 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based awards in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
there is not currently a market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models 
see note and note to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our sfas r disclosures 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowance for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding account balances and the overall quality and age of those balances not specifically reviewed 
in determining the provision for invoices not specifically reviewed  we analyze historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data used to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
we maintain a large customer base that mitigates the risk of concentration with one customer 
however  if the overall condition of the health care industry were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of our customers ability to make payments  significant additional allowances could be required 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of accounts receivable allowances  comprised of both allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns  of million and million at december  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventory we calculate an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory based on historical turnover and assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
our industry is characterized by regular new product development  and as such  our inventory is at risk of obsolescence following the introduction and development of new or enhanced products 
our estimate and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our sales forecasts 
future product introductions and related inventories may require additional reserves based upon changes in market demand or introduction of competing technologies 
increases in the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory result in a corresponding expense to cost of goods sold 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
valuation of acquired in process research and development  goodwill and other intangible assets when we acquire another company  the purchase price is allocated  as applicable  between acquired in process research and development  other identifiable intangible assets  tangible net assets and goodwill as required by us gaap 
in process research and development is defined as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to in process research and development and other intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates that may change over time 
during  we recorded an in process research and development charge of million related to the january  acquisition of the remaining minority interest in mti 
the income approach was used to determine the fair values of the acquired in process research and development 
this approach establishes fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to the in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to the present value 
revenue estimates were based on relative market size  expected market growth rates and market share penetration 
gross margin estimates were based on the estimated cost of the product at the time of introduction and historical gross margins for similar products offered by us or by competitors in the marketplace 
the estimated selling  general and administrative expenses were based on historical operating expenses of the acquired company as well as long term expense levels based on industry comparables 
the costs to complete each project were based on estimated direct project expenses as well as the remaining labor hours and related overhead costs 
in arriving at the value of acquired in process research and development projects  we considered the project s stage of completion  the complexity of the work to be completed  the costs already incurred  the remaining costs to complete the project  the contribution of core technologies  the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology 
the discount rate used to arrive at the present value of acquired in process research and development as of the acquisition date was based on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors 
we believe that the estimated acquired in process research and development amounts determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets  including in process research and development  of the acquired businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
goodwill was million and million at december  and  respectively 
other intangible assets consist primarily of purchased developed technology  patents  customer relationships and trademarks and are amortized over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
we review these intangible assets for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter or as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value may not be recoverable 
other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the evaluation of asset impairments related to goodwill and other intangible assets require us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the assets being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must reflect this increase as an expense within the tax provision in our consolidated statement of operations 
management s judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we will continue to monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a portion of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to goodwill if and when that portion of the deferred tax asset is realized and the related valuation allowance is reversed 
seasonality our business is seasonal in nature 
historically  demand for our products has been the highest in our fourth fiscal quarter 
we traditionally experience lower sales volumes in our third fiscal quarter than throughout the rest of the year as a result of the european holiday schedule during the summer months 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by the rules and regulations of the sec  that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective method 
sfas r requires companies to measure and recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
compensation cost under sfas r is recognized ratably using the straight line attribution method over the expected vesting period 
in addition  pursuant to sfas r  we are required to estimate the amount of expected forfeitures when calculating the compensation costs  instead of accounting for forfeitures as incurred  which was our previous method 
prior periods are not restated under this transition method 
options previously awarded and classified as equity continue to maintain their equity classification and there has been no reclassification of awards in our consolidated balance sheet 
prior to january  and since the beginning of  we accounted for share based awards under the recognition provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation using the modified prospective method of adoption described in sfas we used the minimum value pricing model for measuring the fair value of our options granted through the first quarter  which does not take into consideration volatility 
in accordance with sfas  subsequent to april   the date of our initial filing of the registration statement relating to our initial public offering with the sec  we used the black scholes method  including an estimated volatility assumption  to estimate the fair value of all option grants 
expense previously recognized related to options that were cancelled or forfeited prior to vesting was reversed in the period of the cancellation or forfeiture  as allowed under sfas in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
r fsp r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
fsp r provides an elective alternative transition method for calculating the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of sfas r 
the implementation of fsp r did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies when tax benefits should be recorded in financial statements  requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters and indicates how any tax reserves should be classified in a balance sheet 
fin is effective for us on january  we do not believe the adoption of fin will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurement 
this standard provides guidance on using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
the statement is effective for us beginning in  however  early adoption is permitted 
we have not yet determined the impact  if any  that the implementation of sfas will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november   with early application encouraged 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  which are potential losses arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign exchange fluctuations 
we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  however  our policy is to only enter into contracts that can be designated as normal purchases or sales 
interest rate risk borrowings under our revolving line of credit bear interest at a variable rate equal to svb s prime rate 
borrowings under the equipment line bear interest at a variable rate equal to svb s prime rate plus 
we currently do not use interest rate swaps to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
as of december   we had no borrowings under our revolving line of credit and had million in borrowings under the equipment line 
based upon this debt level  a increase in the interest rate on such borrowings would cause us to incur an increase in interest expense of approximately thousand on an annual basis 
foreign currency exchange rate risk fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies could adversely affect our financial results 
approximately and of our net sales in and  respectively  were denominated in foreign currencies 
we expect that foreign currencies will continue to represent a similarly significant percentage of our net sales in the future 
selling  marketing and administrative costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currency  thereby limiting our transaction risk exposure 
however  for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases and if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our price not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
approximately and of our net sales denominated in foreign currencies in and  respectively  were derived from european union countries and were denominated in the euro 
additionally  we have significant intercompany receivables from our foreign subsidiaries  which are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the yen 
our principal exchange rate risks therefore exist between the us dollar and the euro and between the us dollar and the yen 
fluctuations from the beginning to the end of any given reporting period result in the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated receivables and payables  generating currency transaction gains or losses that impact our non operating income expense levels in the respective period and are reported in other income expense  net in our consolidated financial statements 
we recorded a million foreign currency transaction gain in and a million foreign currency transaction loss in  related to the translation of our foreign denominated net receivables into us dollars 
we do not currently hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we may  however  hedge such exposure to foreign currency exchange rates in the future
