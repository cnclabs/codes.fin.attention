item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k and the documents incorporated by reference herein 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
we utilize fiscal years that end on the saturday nearest to june for clarity of presentation  we have described all fiscal years as if they end on june fiscal years and each include weeks 
fiscal year includes weeks 
overview we were founded in to develop  manufacture and sell high performance signal analysis tools to scientists engaged in high energy physics research 
in we introduced our first oscilloscope using our core competency of designing signal acquisition and digitizing technology 
we are a leading  worldwide provider of oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers as well as a provider of related test and measurement equipment and currently operate as one business segment in the test and measurement market 
our oscilloscopes are tools used by designers and engineers to measure and analyze complex electronic signals in order to develop high performance systems  to validate electronic designs and to improve time to market 
we currently offer six families of oscilloscopes  which address different solutions to the markets we serve waveexpert  a powerful family of sampling oscilloscopes and modules  wavemaster  one of our high performance product families  wavepro  which is targeted at the mid to high performance sector  waverunner  designed for the mid performance sector  wavesurfer  designed for value oriented users in the low performance bandwith sector of the market  and wavejet  our entry level oscilloscope products 
our protocol analyzers are tools used by designers and engineers to generate and monitor traffic over high speed serial data interfaces  including usb  bluetooth  pci express  serial ata  serial attached scsi sas  wireless usb  and others 
we sell our products into a broad range of end markets  including computer semiconductor consumer electronics  data storage  automotive industrial  and military aerospace markets 
we believe that our products offer the strongest value proposition in these markets by providing advanced analysis capabilities coupled with innovative and proprietary technology features 
we believe designers in all of these markets are developing products which rely on increasingly complex electronic signals to provide the features and performance their customers require 
we employ a direct sales model utilizing a highly skilled global sales force where it makes economic sense to do so 
we supplement our direct sales force with a combination of manufacturers representatives and distributors in certain geographic areas 
we divided the world into four areas north america  europe middle east  japan and asia pacific 
in north america we sell our products directly in the united states and are in the early stages of developing a strong manufacturers representative channel 
in europe middle east  we sell our products directly in switzerland  germany  italy  france  the united kingdom and sweden 
in japan  we sell our products through distributors 
in asia pacific  we sell our products directly in south korea  singapore and five regions in china 
we generate revenue in a single segment within the test and measurement market  primarily from the sale of our oscilloscopes  protocol analyzers  probes  accessories  and applications solutions 
to a lesser extent  we also generate revenue from the sales of our extended warranty  maintenance contracts and repairs and calibrations on our instruments after their warranties expire 
generally  we transact revenues and pay our operating expenses in the local currencies of the countries in which we have a direct distribution presence or other operations  with limited exceptions  most notably in china where our sales and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars 
in europe middle east  we transact 
table of contents business in euros  swiss francs  british pounds  swedish krona and us dollars 
in japan  we transact business in japanese yen 
in south korea  we transact business in korean won and in singapore  we transact business in both us dollars and singapore dollars 
for a discussion of our foreign currency exchange rate exposure  see below  item a of this part ii entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 
historically  we have  at times  experienced lower levels of demand during our first fiscal quarter than in other fiscal quarters which  we believe  have been principally due to the lower level of general market activity during the summer months  particularly in europe 
cost of revenues represents manufacturing and service costs  which primarily comprise materials  labor and factory overhead 
gross profit represents revenues less cost of revenues 
additional factors integral to gross profit earned on our products are mix  as the list prices of our products range from  to  and the effects of foreign currencies  as approximately two thirds of our revenues are derived overseas  much of which is denominated in local currencies while product manufacturing costs are primarily us dollar denominated 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related overhead costs for sales  marketing and administrative personnel as well as legal  accounting and other professional services 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead costs associated with employees engaged in research  design and development activities  as well as the cost of masks  wafers and other materials and related test services and equipment used in the development process 
our results of operations and financial condition are affected by a variety of factors 
as discussed below  we believe the most significant recurring factors are the economic strength of the technology markets into which we sell our products  our ability to identify market demands and develop competitive products to meet those demands  the announcements and actions of our competitors and our ability to enter into new markets and broaden our presence in existing markets 
our sales are largely dependent on the health and growth of technology companies whose operations tend to be cyclical 
consequently  demand for our products tends to coincide with the increase or decrease in capital spending in the technology industry 
in addition  in response to fluctuations in the technology markets we target  we continually assess and adopt programs aimed at positioning us for long term success 
these programs may include streamlining operations  discontinuing older and less profitable product lines  changing our future product strategy  and reducing operating expenses from time to time 
as an example  in fiscal and we implemented restructuring and business realignment plans intended to reduce costs and more efficiently allocate product development resources 
for a more detailed discussion of our restructuring efforts in fiscal and  see the section entitled restructuring and asset impairment  below 
we face significant competition in our target markets 
we believe that in order to continue to compete successfully  we need to timely anticipate  recognize and respond to changing market demands by providing products that serve our customers needs as they arise at prices acceptable to the market 
we believe that we compete favorably with our competition in each of these areas 
consequently  we are constantly reviewing our product development strategy and invest time  resources and capital in development projects we deem most likely to succeed 
in furtherance of our drive to meet our customers changing demands  we also look outside our organization for opportunities to expand our markets 
accordingly  on october  and october   we completed the acquisitions of computer access technology corporation catc and catalyst enterprises  inc catalyst  respectively  to complement our expanding portfolio of serial data test solutions 
this division  protocol solutions group psg  now represents about of our total business 
the acquisitions of catc and catalyst are described more fully below 
in march  we completed purchase and settlement agreements with iwatsu electric corporation that included the rights to a new low end product line  viewgo  re engineered and launched as the wavejet family of products  as well as unrelated intellectual property designs and a year non compete agreement 

table of contents also in fiscal  we transformed our entire low and mid range product lines by introducing a new line of waverunners and wavesurfers and adding the new wavejet product line noted above 
additionally  we expanded our high end product line by introducing the sda we believe that our diversified product mix strategically positions us to expand our presence in the oscilloscope market 
catc acquisition on october   we completed our acquisition of of the outstanding common stock of catc the catc merger 
catc is a provider of advanced verification systems for existing and emerging digital communications standards 
catc s products are used by semiconductor  device  system and software companies at each phase of their products lifecycles from development through production and market deployment 
catc had approximately employees at the time of the catc merger 
total consideration paid to acquire catc was approximately million 
the catc merger was recorded under the purchase method of accounting  which requires that the total consideration be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values 
on the effective date of the catc merger  each share of catc common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior thereto was canceled and converted into the right to receive in cash 
in addition  we paid cash to the holders of catc s outstanding  vested  in the money stock options and employee stock purchase plan purchase rights 
further  we assumed catc s outstanding unvested stock options  as well as certain vested but unexercised stock options  by granting to catc employees a total of  options to purchase lecroy common stock the lecroy options 
the lecroy options were recorded at their fair values using the black scholes option pricing model based on a stock price of per share  which was the closing price of lecroy common stock on october   less the intrinsic value of unvested options  which was to be charged as compensation expense to operations as earned by employees over their remaining vesting periods 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at their fair values  the remaining unamortized deferred compensation was eliminated against additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheet in the first fiscal quarter of and the fair value of remaining unvested lecroy options is being recognized in our consolidated financial statements over the remaining requisite service period 
see critical accounting policies below 
lecroy paid cash of million  net of cash acquired  using million of cash on hand and borrowings of million under our million senior  secured  five year credit agreement entered into on october   with the lenders listed therein and jp morgan chase bank  na  successor to the bank of new york  as administrative agent for such lenders

catalyst acquisition on september   the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement among the company  franklin congress corporation  a california corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the company sub  catalyst  and nader salehomoum  as equityholder representative  pursuant to which sub merged with and into catalyst the catalyst merger  with catalyst continuing as the surviving corporation and as a owned subsidiary of the company 
catalyst is a manufacturer of data bus analysis and emulation tools for advanced serial data communications and strengthens the company s position in protocol solutions 
the catalyst merger was recorded under the purchase method of accounting  which requires that the total consideration be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values 
on october   the effective date of the catalyst merger  all shares of common stock of catalyst issued and outstanding immediately prior to the catalyst merger were exchanged for approximately million in cash immediately 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  of the stated consideration was placed into escrow for the twelve month period following the closing of the catalyst merger to secure certain indemnification obligations under the terms of the merger agreement 
lecroy paid cash of million  including direct transaction costs of million  net of cash acquired of million  using proceeds from the revolver under the prior credit agreement note long term debt and 
table of contents capital leases  issued a million  promissory note payable on january   to nader salehomoum  the former sole shareholder of catalyst and current employee of the company and assumed the fair value of certain vested catalyst stock options totaling million

restructuring and related asset impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we changed our sales strategy in japan which resulted in the closure of certain office facilities  which included lease termination costs  and headcount reductions of four employees or of the workforce as compared to june  as a result  we recorded severance and related expenses  of approximately million  and facility closure costs of approximately million 
as of june   approximately  has been paid in cash and approximately million remains in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
severance and other related amounts under this plan are estimated to be paid by the end of the second quarter of fiscal additionally  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  an intangible asset failed the impairment test due to a change in the company s product strategy and  accordingly  the company took a million non cash charge to cost of revenues for the impairment 
in the third quarter of fiscal  prompted by the acquisition of catalyst  we evaluated certain business processes and staffing requirements 
as a result  we recorded severance and related expenses  of approximately million 
the implementation of this plan resulted in headcount reductions of employees or of the workforce as compared to june  as of june   approximately million has been paid in cash and approximately million remains in accrued expenses and other current liabilities  and approximately million remains in deferred revenue and other non current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
severance and other related amounts under this plan are estimated to be paid by the end of the first quarter of fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of a change in the company s organization stemming from the catalyst acquisition  the company recorded severance and related expenses of approximately million 
the implementation of this plan resulted in headcount reductions of eleven employees or of the workforce as compared to june  severance and other related amounts under this plan were fully paid by the end of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company realigned some of its business processes and as a result  incurred severance and related expenses of approximately million 
the implementation of this plan resulted in headcount reductions of sixteen employees or of the workforce as compared to june  as of june   severance and other related amounts under this plan were fully paid 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company realigned some of its business processes and  as a result  incurred expenses of approximately million  consisting of million of severance and related expenses and million of facility closure expenses which included lease termination costs and asset write downs 
as of june   severance and other related amounts under this plan were fully paid and assets have been written off 
finally  during the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of the catc merger  the company adopted a plan to restructure its organization and refine its product strategy 
in connection with the adoption of this plan  the company recorded a charge for severance and related expenses in fiscal of approximately million 
the implementation of this plan resulted in headcount reductions of six employees or approximately of the workforce as compared to june  as of june   severance and other related amounts under this plan were fully paid 
additionally  in the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of a change in the company s organization stemming from the catc merger and a subsequent change in the company s low to mid range oscilloscope manufacturing strategy  the company took a million non cash charge to cost of revenues for the impairment of a related intangible asset 

table of contents the below table summarizes our restructuring charges and related asset impairment for the fiscal years ended june   and in thousands fiscal year charges for impaired intangible assets service center closure severance and related costs cost of revenues charges for severance and related costs research and development charges for severance and related costs facility closure selling  general and administrative these restructuring and business realignment charges represent our best efforts to respond to the current demands in our industry 
however  these and future cost reductions  or other benefits expected from the restructuring  may be insufficient to align our operations with customer demand and the changes affecting our industry  or may be more costly or extensive than currently anticipated 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and assumptions are based on management s judgment and available information and  consequently  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition 
we enter into agreements to sell products  services  and other arrangements that include combinations of products and services 
revenue from product sales  net of allowances for anticipated returns  is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  or when services have been provided 
the price is considered fixed or determinable when it is not subject to refund or adjustments 
in the first quarter of fiscal  in an effort to provide end user customers an alternative to purchasing the company s higher end products under its standard terms and conditions  the company began offering customers an opportunity to enter into sales type or direct financing leases for these products 
the company is accounting for these leases in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
lease and rental revenues are reported within test and measurement product revenue 
through march   we deferred revenue on shipments of our wavesurfer family of oscilloscopes until they were sold by the distributor to their customers sell through method because of the associated uncertainty about sell through volumes which precluded us from being able to sufficiently estimate the amounts of potential 
table of contents product returns due to the fact that this was a new product distributed via a new channel 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  since we had four full quarters of experience with this product and channel with no significant returns  we had sufficient data to estimate potential returns 
therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 we recognized previously deferred revenue of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal revenue from services is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use relative fair values to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
the amount of revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
due to the significant software content of our protocol analyzer products  we recognize revenue on the sale of these products in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition sop as amended by statement of position  upon shipment provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
software maintenance support revenue is deferred based on its vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe and recognized ratably over the maintenance support periods 
provisions for warranty costs are recorded at the time products are recognized as revenue 
revenues from protocol analyzer products are included in test and measurement products in the consolidated statements of operations 
net reserves on accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts relating to the portion of the accounts receivable which we estimate is non collectible 
we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  which includes the allowance for anticipated returns  was approximately million and million at june  and  respectively 
changes in the overall economic environment or in the financial condition of our customers may require adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
we assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and provide an allowance for the value of estimated excess and obsolete raw materials and work in process inventory 
our marketing department plays a key role in our inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts  managing product rollovers and working with our manufacturing department to maximize recovery of excess inventory 
based upon management s forecast  inventory items no longer expected to be used in the future are considered obsolete and the difference between an inventory s quantity and its forecasted usage are classified as excess 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at june  and  respectively 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory allowances for excess or obsolete inventory may be required 
deferred tax assets 
we have recorded approximately million of deferred tax assets as of june  for the future tax benefits of certain expenses reported for financial statement purposes that have not yet been deducted on our tax returns 
significant components of our deferred tax assets are federal  state and foreign net operating loss and credit carryforwards  inventory reserves and other reserves 
the recognition of this deferred tax asset is based on the assessment that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income within statutory carryforward periods to realize the benefit of these tax deductions 
the factors that management considers in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income  reversal of taxable temporary differences  and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
based on this information  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of june  to reserve for certain tax credits and foreign net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty surrounding the utilization of these deferred tax assets 
adjustments to the valuation allowance may be made in the future if it is determined that the realizable amount of net operating losses and other deferred tax assets is greater or less than the amount recorded 
such adjustments may be material to our results of operations when made 

table of contents valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives including technology  manufacturing and distribution rights and patents and other intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable  but not less than once annually 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets by determining whether the carrying values of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
management estimates the undiscounted cash flows of these rights on the basis of actual and forecasted production units as well as the average selling price and standard costs of the related products after the amortization of the rights to determine profitability 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amounts exceed the fair value 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance by us relative to historical or projected operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we recognized intangible asset impairments of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  due to changes in product strategy  which eliminated the usefulness and value of the assets 
there were no impairment indicators during the fiscal year ended june  goodwill 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually under a two step approach  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level by applying a fair value based test 
a reporting unit is defined as the same as or one level below the operating segment level as described in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we have one reporting unit for the purposes of sfas no 
because none of the components of our operating segment constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the results of operations 
the first step is to identify if an impairment of goodwill has occurred by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
in this second step  the implied fair value as defined in sfas no 
of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
we completed the annual impairment test required under sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal after completion of our annual financial operating plan and determined that there was no impairment to our recorded goodwill balance of million at june  we use a fair value based test using our market capitalization to estimate the company s fair value 
there were no impairment indicators during the fiscal year ended june  we did  however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal and  reduce our catc goodwill by approximately million and million  respectively  as a result of a reversal of a pre acquisition tax contingency reserve 
warranty 
provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are derived from historical data of product reliability and for new products  published by a third party expected failure rates 
the expected failure is arrived at in terms of units  which are then converted into labor hours to which an average fully burdened cost per hour is applied to derive the amount of accrued warranty required 
on a quarterly basis  we study trends of warranty claims  review estimates of costs to repair and take action to improve the quality of our products and minimize our warranty exposure 
the warranty reserve was million  million and million at june   and  respectively 
management believes that the warranty reserve is appropriate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
share based compensation expense 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the provisions of sfas r  share based payment  which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at their fair values 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective application method under which the provisions of sfas r apply to new awards and to awards modified  
table of contents repurchased  or cancelled after the adoption date 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options on the date of grant which requires certain estimates by management including the expected volatility and expected term of the option 
management also makes decisions regarding the risk free interest rate used in the model and makes estimates regarding forfeiture rates 
actual forfeitures and fluctuations in the market that affect these estimates could have an impact on the resulting compensation cost 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered that were outstanding as of the adoption date is being recognized over the remaining service period after the adoption date 
total share based compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june  was million 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of our total revenues for the fiscal years indicated year ended june  revenues test and measurement products service and other total revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative legal settlement research and development total operating expenses operating loss income interest income interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt other  net other expense  net loss income before income taxes benefit from provision for income taxes net loss income comparison of fiscal years and total revenues were million for the year ended june   compared to million in the prior year  a net decrease of  or million 
the total decrease in revenue was partially offset by revenue derived from the catalyst acquisition which mitigated the impact by and favorable currency fluctuation of 
revenues from test and measurement products decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in test and measurement products was mainly due to a reduction in shipments to our disk drive customers as a result of decreased demand  the longer than anticipated time to finalize our new distributor arrangement in japan  and the reduction in the average selling prices in our high end products which have been impacted by competitive pressure in the marketplace 
additionally  mid and low end products have not penetrated the market fully  and there has been lower than expected demand from our next generation products and serial data protocol solutions 
these decreases were partially offset by the addition of revenue from our september acquisition of catalyst as noted above 

table of contents service and other revenues consist primarily of service revenue and license and maintenance fees 
service revenue decreased by  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a reduction in the amount recognized of previously deferred revenue from the adoption of the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the fiscal year ended june  did not include revenue related to this previously deferred revenue as it was fully amortized as of march  fiscal included million of revenue recognized from previously deferred revenue 
our geographic breakdown of revenues by area in total dollars and as a percentage of total revenues is as follows in thousands year ended june  year ended june  north america north america europe middle east europe middle east japan japan asia pacific asia pacific total revenues total revenues our geographic revenues were lower in north america  japan and asia pacific 
this decrease was mainly attributable to a slower than anticipated ramp up of sales via our indirect selling channel of our mid to low end product line  the longer than anticipated time to finalize our distribution strategy in japan  as well as a decrease in the average selling prices in the high end product line 
europe middle east was the exception where our operations have incorporated our diverse product lines through indirect and direct channels more effectively 
gross profit for the year ended june  was million  or gross margin  compared to million  or gross margin  for the same period last year 
the lower gross margin in fiscal was primarily attributable to million of costs associated with inventory write downs and the elimination of a product line  million charge for the impairment of an intangible asset  million relating to the implementation of a restructuring plan and the balance primarily due to lower sales volume and the impact of lower average selling prices on our high end products  partially offset by incremental profit from sales of catalyst protocol analyzers 
in the fiscal period there were no similar write downs affecting gross margin  however  in  we received price reductions from a vendor for inventory purchases which increased our overall gross margin on resulting product sales by 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense increased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to million of restructuring charges prompted by the acquisition of catalyst as well as the reorganization of our japan facility  million of increased commissions for the addition of the manufacturers representative channel and employee commission  million of freight expenses and additional sg a expenses related to catalyst 
these increases were primarily offset by a decrease of million related to non cash share based compensation expense and a decrease of approximately million related to legal and consulting expenses 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expense increased from in the year ended june  to in the year ended june  legal settlement expense of million  for the year ended june   is related to the settlement of a dispute with iwatsu pertaining to the ownership rights of certain intellectual property and other assets relating to iwatsu s viewgo product line 
there was no similar charge in the fiscal period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
research and development r d expense increased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase in expense is primarily due to a million charge for acquired in process research and development ipr d related to the catalyst acquisition  million of restructuring charges and additional expenses related to catalyst 
additionally  expenses incurred for prototype materials and 
table of contents supplies used for several product launches in the beginning of the year contributed to the overall increase 
there was no similar ipr d charge in the fiscal period 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expense increased from in fiscal to in fiscal other expense  net  which consists primarily of interest income and expense and foreign exchange gains and losses  was approximately million for the year ended june   compared to million for fiscal other expense  net for the current year is comprised primarily of interest expense of approximately million  compared to approximately million last year  which increase is due to a the issuance of million of convertible notes in october see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
interest expense for both periods also includes interest on capital lease agreements and bank debt 
interest expense was partially offset by interest income of approximately million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
included in other  net were foreign exchange losses of million for both of the years ended june  and  resulting from the changes in our foreign exchange forward contracts and on transactions denominated in other than our functional currency or that of our subsidiaries 
the loss on extinguishment of debt of million relates to the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of the term loan and revolver under the prior credit agreement 
a tax benefit of million was recorded in fiscal  compared to a tax provision of million in fiscal the company s effective tax rate was and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the effective income tax benefit rate differs from prior year principally due to discrete tax items for the non deductible purchased ipr d charges associated with the catalyst acquisition  and a million increase to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to a change in judgment regarding the realizability of certain state investment tax credits and certain foreign net operating losses 
comparison of fiscal years and total revenues were million for the year ended june   compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of  or million 
foreign currency fluctuations reduced total revenues by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal revenues from test and measurement products decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease in product revenue was mainly attributable to a decline in shipments of our wavesurfer and waverunner product lines 
in anticipation of our new lower end product introductions  we experienced a delay in customer orders which significantly contributed to this decline 
product revenue was also impacted from lower average selling prices due to increased competition in the low end oscilloscope market 
additionally  in fiscal there was a decrease in product revenue for component parts as we limited our relationship with a third party manufacturer 
this decrease was partially offset by continued strong sales of our high end oscilloscopes and the introduction of the wavejet 
our protocol solutions group psg  for the full fiscal year contributed to total revenue of approximately over the comparable prior year period which only included eight months of psg revenue 
service and other revenues consist primarily of service revenue and license and maintenance fees 
service revenue decreased by  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily from a lower volume of locally provided items in our foreign operations 
the decrease was also the result of a reduction in the amount recognized of previously deferred revenue from the adoption of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as of the beginning of fiscal the fiscal year ended june  included million of revenue recognized from previously deferred revenue compared to million in fiscal

gross profit for the year ended june  was million  or gross margin  compared to million  or gross margin  for the same period last year 
the lower gross margin in fiscal was primarily attributable to the second fiscal quarter merger related non cash charges of million for the write down of inventory related to the changes in our long term product support policy and product roadmap strategy as well as million for the impairment of an intangible asset due to a change in our manufacturing strategy and million for the write down of inventory  primarily related to a lower cost or market adjustment 
in the fiscal period there were no similar write downs affecting gross margin  however  we received price reductions from a vendor for inventory purchases which positively impacted our overall gross margin by on resulting product sales 
in addition  gross margins benefited from higher psg margins which increased gross margin by approximately over the full twelve month period in fiscal as compared to an immaterial impact for the twelve month period in fiscal that included only eight months of psg activity offset by the related write up of acquired inventory to its fair value 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was mainly attributable to million of decreases in personnel related and general expenses due to a prior year restructuring and office closures  a million decrease in bonus and commission expenses as well as million decrease in legal and consulting expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in non cash share based compensation expense and increases of million mainly in travel and entertainment expense and freight expense 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expense decreased from in the year ended june  to in the year ended june  this decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to our continued ability to leverage expenses

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we purchase materials from suppliers and sell our products around the world and maintain investments in foreign subsidiaries  all denominated in a variety of currencies 
as a consequence  we are exposed to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to a number of currencies  changes in government policies and legal and regulatory requirements  and political instability 
among the more significant potential risks to us of relative fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is the relationship among and between the us dollar  euro  swiss franc  british pound  swedish krona  japanese yen  korean won and singapore dollar 
we have a program of entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the risks associated with currency fluctuations on assets or liabilities denominated in other than the functional currency of us or our subsidiaries 
it cannot be assured  however  that this program will effectively offset all of our foreign currency risk related to these assets or liabilities 
these foreign exchange forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities sfas no 

other than this program  we do not attempt to reduce our foreign currency exchange risks by entering into foreign currency management programs 
as a consequence  there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future resulting in mismatches between local currency revenues and expenses  the translation of foreign currencies into the us dollar  our financial reporting currency  or otherwise  will not adversely affect our results of operations 
moreover  fluctuations in exchange rates could affect the demand for our products 
during fiscal  and  foreign currency exchange net gains losses on these derivatives and on transactions denominated in other than their functional currencies were million  million  and million  respectively 
these net gains losses are included in other  net in the consolidated statements of operations

we performed a sensitivity analysis for the fourth quarter of fiscal assuming a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign exchange forward contracts and our assets and liabilities denominated in other than their functional currencies 
in management s opinion  a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would have an immaterial effect on these instruments and therefore  on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  and cash flows from operations 
on october   the company completed the sale of million of convertible senior notes the notes due october  the notes will pay interest semiannually through maturity and will be convertible at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of the company s common stock 
the conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
upon conversion of the notes  holders will receive cash up to the principal amount of each note  and any excess conversion value will be delivered in cash or shares of lecroy s common stock  at the company s option 
as of june   the market value of the convertible notes was million 
we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates primarily due to our investment in cash and cash equivalents as well as our million credit facility 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates  which would have been immaterial to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows in fiscal please refer to note long term debt and capital leases for specifics related to our credit facility
