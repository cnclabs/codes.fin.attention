item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion is intended to provide insight into the financial condition and results of operations of united and its subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
net income was million in  an increase of from the million earned in diluted earnings per common share was for  compared with for  an increase of 
return on tangible equity for was  compared with for return on assets for was as compared to in earnings for were influenced by strong loan and deposit growth  rising interest rates and significant de novo expansion 
in addition to those factors  acquisitions completed in also affect comparisons between and growth in the loan portfolio and rising interest rates drove the million  or increase  in taxable equivalent net interest revenue 
the net interest margin increased basis points to  as rising interest rates had a positive effect on united s slightly asset sensitive balance sheet 
the local economies in united s markets have remained strong over the past two years which was a contributing factor to the strong loan growth 
during and  loan growth occurred across all of united s markets with the majority of the growth occurring in the construction and commercial categories 
in both and  united continued to grow core deposits primarily through its successful refer a friend program that rewards existing customers who refer their family and friends to united 
in and  united aggressively pursued customer certificates of deposit as those rates did not rise as fast as wholesale borrowings with comparable terms 
the resulting increase in customer deposits funded united s loan growth excluding acquisitions of million and allowed united to decrease wholesale borrowings by million during contributing to the increase in net interest margin 
credit quality remained strong in net charge offs were slightly lower than the prior year  while non performing assets were up slightly from the end of nonperforming assets  which includes nonaccrual loans  loans past due more than days and foreclosed real estate  were up  from while loans increased million over the same period  excluding acquisitions 
because of the increase in loans in  at december   nonperforming assets represented only 
of total assets compared with 
at the end of net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were 
compared with 
for management believes that its continued strong credit quality is the result of a combination of factors  most important of which is its community banking business model  which includes community banks managed by local presidents with a local board of directors as well as management who know their markets and their customers 
the second key factor is that over of our loans are secured by real estate located within our geographic footprint 
fee revenue in increased million  or  from there were modest increases in most fee categories  with the exception of mortgage loan and other related fees  which were flat  and other fees which were down 
service charges and fees continued to rise due to an increase in the number of deposit accounts and transaction volume associated with initiatives to raise core deposits and attract new customers 
in  united recognized  in net securities losses compared with net securities losses of  in the losses recognized in resulted from a decision to restructure the investment portfolio to improve yield given the market and future expectations 
included in securities gains and losses in was an impairment loss of  related to a fhlmc preferred stock investment where the loss in market value was considered to be other than temporary 
that security was sold in operating expenses were up million  or  from the increase resulted primarily from united s continued de novo expansion 
in  united opened eight locations which followed seven new locations in these new locations increased headcount by employees from december  the acquisitions of southern national bank and two branches in western north carolina alone added another staff 
aside from the de novo locations and the acquisitions  headcount at the end of was held to a year over year increase of staff  or  to support core business growth 
in the fourth quarter of  united completed the acquisition of southern bancorp  inc  and its wholly owned subsidiary  southern national bank 
the company exchanged  shares of its common stock with a value of approximately million 
the assets of southern national bank  including purchase accounting adjustments  totaled million  and were included in united s consolidated balance sheet as of december  critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of united and its subsidiaries are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
these estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  
table of contents the financial statements could reflect different estimates or judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates or judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon future events 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record the valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies for united are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
management views critical accounting policies to be those that are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments  estimates and assumptions  and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the financial statements 
management currently views the determination of the allowance for loan losses to be the only critical accounting policy 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on non impaired loans based on historical loss experience  management s evaluation of the current loan portfolio  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
loan losses are charged against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
the allowance for loan losses consists of an allocated component and an unallocated component 
the components of the allowance for loan losses represent an estimate pursuant to either statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  or sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses reflects expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category 
the specific credit allocations are based on regular analyses of all loans over  where the internal credit rating is at or below a grade seven and on the watch list 
these analyses involve judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans  including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values 
the historical loss element is determined using the average of actual losses incurred over the prior two years for each type of loan 
the historical loss experience is adjusted for known changes in economic conditions and credit quality trends such as changes in the amount of past due and nonperforming loans 
the resulting loss allocation factors are applied to the balance of each type of loan after removing the balance of impaired loans and other specifically allocated loans from each category 
the loss allocation factors are updated quarterly 
the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses also includes consideration of concentrations of credit and changes in portfolio mix 
the unallocated portion of the allowance reflects management s estimate of probable inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate to subsequent loss rates  and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
in addition  the unallocated allowance includes a component that accounts for the inherent imprecision in loan loss estimation based on historical loss experience as a result of united s growth through acquisitions  which have expanded the geographic footprint in which it operates  and changed its portfolio mix in recent years 
also  loss data representing a complete economic cycle is not available for all sectors 
uncertainty surrounding the strength and timing of economic cycles also affects estimates of loss 
the historical losses used in developing loss allocation factors may not be representative of actual unrealized losses inherent in the portfolio 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its processes for determining the allowance adequately consider all the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
additional information on united s loan portfolio and allowance for loan losses can be found in the sections of management s discussion and analysis titled asset quality and risk elements and nonperforming assets and in the sections of part i  item titled lending policy and loan review and non performing assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes additional information on united s accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents mergers and acquisitions as part of its balanced growth strategy  united selectively engages in evaluation of strategic partnerships 
mergers and acquisitions present opportunities to enter new markets with an established presence and a capable management team already in place 
united employs certain criteria to ensure that any merger or acquisition candidate meets strategic growth and earnings objectives that will build future franchise value for shareholders 
additionally  the criteria include ensuring that management of a potential partner shares united s community banking philosophy of premium service quality and operates in attractive  high growth markets with excellent opportunities for further organic growth 
although no acquisitions were completed in  united completed one bank merger and two branch acquisitions in and three bank mergers in as part of this strategy 
united will continue to evaluate potential transactions as they are presented 
on june   united completed the acquisition of fairbanco holding company  inc  a bank holding company headquartered in fairburn  georgia  and its wholly owned georgia subsidiary  st community bank 
on june   st community bank had assets of million  including purchase accounting related intangibles

southern national bank was merged into ucb georgia 
the cobb county location is now included with united community bank metro  and the cherokee county location operates as a separate community bank  united community bank cherokee 
merger related charges much of the discussion contained in this report is presented on an operating basis 
the presentation of operating earnings excludes merger related charges that are considered non recurring and is therefore not consistent with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
merger related charges in related to the acquisitions of southern and the two north carolina branches were insignificant and are therefore not shown separately 
pre tax merger related charges of 
million and million were incurred in and  respectively 
these charges decreased net income by 
million and million and diluted earnings per share by 
and  respectively  for and these charges are discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these charges are excluded because management believes that non gaap operating results provide a helpful measure for assessing united s financial performance 
net operating income should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with gaap  and is not necessarily comparable to non gaap performance measures that may be presented by other companies 
the following is a reconciliation of net operating income to gaap net income 
there were no merger related or restructuring charges incurred in or 
table of contents table operating earnings to gaap earnings reconciliation merger related charges included in expenses salaries and employee benefits severance and related costs professional fees contract termination costs other merger related expenses total merger related charges income tax effect of above charges after tax effect of merger related charges net income reconciliation net operating income after tax effect of merger related charges net income gaap basic earnings per share reconciliation basic operating earnings per share per share effect of merger related charges basic earnings per share gaap diluted earnings per share reconciliation diluted operating earnings per share per share effect of merger related charges diluted earnings per share gaap results of operations the remainder of this financial discussion focuses on operating earnings which exclude merger related charges  except for the discussion of income taxes 
operating and gaap earnings were the same in  and for additional information on merger related and restructuring charges  refer to the preceding section on merger related charges and note to the consolidated financial statements 
net interest revenue taxable equivalent net interest revenue the difference between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and other liabilities is the single largest component of united s revenue 
united actively manages this revenue source to provide an optimal level of revenue while balancing interest rate  credit  and liquidity risks 
net interest revenue totaled million in  an increase of million  or  from the level recorded in net interest revenue for increased million  or  over the level 
the main drivers of the increase in net interest revenue for were loan growth and margin expansion due to the effect of rising short term interest rates on united s slightly asset sensitive balance sheet 
average loans increased million  or  from last year reflecting strong core growth 
the average yield on loans increased basis points reflecting the effect of the basis increase in the prime lending rate over the last months on united s predominantly prime based loan portfolio 
there were four increases in the prime lending rate in  the last occurring on june  year end loan balances grew million from resulting in a growth rate 
this growth includes million from the acquisition of southern and million from the acquisition of two branches in western north carolina 
excluding acquisitions  core loan growth was solid across all of united s markets with increases of million in north georgia  million in metro atlanta  in east tennessee  million in western north carolina  and million in coastal georgia 
average interest earning assets for the year increased million  or  over the increase reflects the growth in loans as well as a modest increase in the investment securities portfolio 
the majority of the increase in interest earning assets was funded by interest bearing sources  as the increase in average interest bearing liabilities for the year was million over the average yield on interest earning assets for was up from in reflecting the effect of rising short term interest rates on united s prime based loans 

table of contents the banking industry uses two key ratios to measure relative profitability of net interest revenue  which are the interest rate spread and the net interest margin 
the interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread eliminates the impact of non interest bearing deposits and other non interest bearing funding sources and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
the net interest margin is an indication of the profitability of a company s investments  and is defined as net interest revenue as a percentage of total average interest earning assets which includes the positive impact of funding a portion of interest earning assets with customers non interest bearing deposits and with stockholders equity 
for  and  united s net interest spread was   and  respectively  while the net interest margin was   and  respectively 
both the net interest margin and net interest spread improved in as united s slightly asset sensitive balance sheet benefited from the federal reserve s action in raising short term rates over the last months  the last four increases occurring in the first six months of the and basis point widening in and  respectively  of the net interest margin compared with only a and basis point increases in the net interest spread for the same years  respectively  highlights the increasing relative value of united s non interest bearing funding sources in a rising rate environment 
although the balance sheet remained asset sensitive during primarily due to growth in floating rate loans  management took steps to reduce its exposure to falling interest rates and manage its asset sensitivity by terminating its existing receive fixed pay prime interest rate swap contracts and entering into new interest rate swap and floor contracts 
the loss of approximately million resulting from the termination of the existing interest rate swap contracts million in notional amounts is being amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining contractual life of each terminated swap contract million of amortization was recorded in  and the remaining million will be recorded in 
united entered into new receive fixed pay prime interest rate swap contracts having an aggregate notional amount of million that are being accounted for as cash flow hedges of daily repricing  prime based loans 
the effect of terminating the old swaps and entering into the new swaps was to increase the aggregate notional amount of swaps from million to million and to lengthen the weighted average remaining term of those contracts from months to months 
united also entered into two receive fixed pay month libor interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million that are being accounted for as a fair value hedges of brokered time deposits 
in addition to the new swap contracts  united purchased interest rate floors having a total notional amount of million for which it paid premiums totaling million that are being accounted for as cash flow hedges of daily repricing  prime based loans 
the purchase price of the floors will be amortized against interest revenue over the life of each individual instrument 
see table for details on the derivatives outstanding at december  at december   united had approximately billion in loans indexed to the daily prime rate compared with billion a year ago 
the average rate on interest bearing liabilities for was  up from  reflecting the impact of rising rates on united s floating rate liabilities  higher deposit pricing for selected products and markets and a changing deposit mix with a higher portion of certificates of deposit 
united was able to offset the full impact of rising interest rates on the overall cost of funds by lagging the market on retail deposit rate increases while still remaining competitive 
because customer certificates of deposit did not reflect rising interest rates as quickly as wholesale borrowings  united was able to lower its overall funding cost by aggressively pursuing customer certificates of deposit in and to fund its loan growth and reduce the level of wholesale funding sources 
toward the end of  competition in united s markets had driven certificate of deposit pricing to levels comparable to wholesale borrowings with similar terms 
united s initiatives to increase core deposits have also been influential in keeping the overall cost of funds low by increasing the level of both non interest bearing and lower cost deposit account balances

the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is based upon historical data  subjective judgment and estimates and  therefore  is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge offs may ultimately occur 
due to the imprecise nature of the loan loss estimation process and the effects of changing conditions  these risk attributes may not be adequately captured in the data related to the formula based loan loss components used to determine allocations in united s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
consequently  management believes that the unallocated allowance appropriately reflects probable inherent but undetected losses in the loan portfolio 
the following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for each of the past five years 

table of contents table allocation of allowance for loan losses as of december  in thousands amount amount amount amount amount commercial commercial and industrial commercial secured by real estate total commercial construction residential mortgage installment unallocated total allowance for loan losses loan balance in each category  expressed as a percentage of total loans non performing assets non performing loans  which include non accrual loans and accruing loans past due over days  totaled million at year end  compared with million at december  there is no concentration of non performing loans attributable to any specific industry 
at december  and  the ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 
and  respectively 
non performing assets  which include non performing loans and foreclosed real estate  totaled million at december   compared with million at year end united s policy is to place loans on non accrual status when  in the opinion of management  the principal and interest on a loan is not likely to be repaid in accordance with the loan terms or when the loan becomes days past due and is not both well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current interest revenue 
generally  interest revenue on a non accrual loan is recognized on a cash basis as payments are received 
there were no commitments to lend additional funds to customers whose loans were on non accrual status at december  the table below summarizes non performing assets at year end for the last five years

specific reserves allocated to these impaired loans totaled million at both december  and the average recorded investment in impaired loans for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
united s policy is to recognize interest revenue on a cash basis for loans classified as impaired under sfas no 

table of contents investment securities the composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects united s investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of revenue 
the securities portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  furnishing liquidity  and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits 
total securities available for sale increased million from the end of united continued to purchase securities through as part of a continuing program to help stabilize the interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet  to increase net interest revenue and to replace maturing securities

table carrying value of investment securities as of december  in thousands securities available for sale us treasuries us government agencies state and political subdivisions mortgage backed securities other total securities available for sale the investment securities portfolio consists of us government agency securities  municipal securities  and mortgage backed securities which are primarily us government agency sponsored 
a mortgage backed security relies on the underlying pools of mortgage loans to provide a cash flow of principal and interest 
the actual maturities of these securities will differ from the contractual maturities because the loans underlying the security may prepay without prepayment penalties 
decreases in long term interest rates will generally cause an acceleration of prepayment levels 
in a declining interest rate environment  proceeds may not be able to be reinvested in assets that have comparable yields 
at december   united had of its total investment securities portfolio in mortgage backed securities  compared with at december  united did not have securities of any issuer in excess of of equity at year end or  excluding us government issues

the fhlb advances outstanding at december  had both fixed and floating interest rates ranging from to 
approximately of the fhlb advances mature prior to december  additional information regarding fhlb advances  including scheduled maturities  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity management the primary objective of liquidity management is to ensure that sufficient funding is available  at reasonable cost  to meet ongoing operational cash needs 
while the desired level of liquidity will vary depending upon a number of factors  it is the primary goal of united to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity in reasonably foreseeable economic environments 
liquidity is defined as the ability of a bank to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining united s ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of the banks customers  both depositors and borrowers 
the primary objectives of asset liability management are to provide for adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of customers and to maintain an optimal balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities  so that united can also meet the investment objectives of its shareholders as market interest rates change 
daily monitoring of the sources and uses of funds is necessary to maintain a position that meets both goals 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments and the maturities and sales of securities 
mortgage loans held for sale totaled million at december   and typically turn over every days as closed loans are sold to investors in the secondary market 
construction and commercial loans that mature in one year or less amounted to billion  or  of the loan portfolio at december  the liability section of the balance sheet provides liquidity through depositors interest bearing and non interest bearing accounts 
federal funds purchased  fhlb advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are additional sources of liquidity and represent united s incremental borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are short term in nature and are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet other short term liquidity needs 
the table below presents a summary of united s short term borrowings over the last three years

united s internal policy limits brokered deposits to of total non brokered deposits 
at december   united had the capacity to increase brokered deposits by billion and still remain within this limit 
in addition to these wholesale sources  united has the ability to attract retail deposits at any time by competing more aggressively on pricing

uses of cash from operating activities includes an increase in other assets and accrued interest receivable of million  an increase in mortgages held for sale of million and a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million consisted primarily of the net increase in loans of million  a net increase in securities of million and net cash provided from business combinations of million 
net cash provided by financing activities provided the remainder of funding sources for the million of net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of a net increase in deposits of million and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million 
the increases were partially offset by a net decrease in fhlb advances of million 
in the opinion of management  united s liquidity position at december  is sufficient to meet its expected cash flow requirements 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements united is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  letters of credit and financial guarantees 
a commitment to extend credit is an agreement to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
letters of credit and financial guarantees are conditional commitments issued to guarantee a customer s performance to a third party and have essentially the same credit risk as extending loan facilities to customers 
those commitments are primarily issued to local businesses 
the exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the commitments to extend credit  letters of credit and financial guarantees is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
united uses the same credit underwriting procedures for making commitments  letters of credit and financial guarantees as for on balance sheet instruments 
united evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis and the amount of the collateral  if deemed necessary  is based on the credit evaluation 
collateral held varies  but may include unimproved and improved real estate  certificates of deposit  personal property or other acceptable collateral 
all of these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the total amount of these instruments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements because a significant portion of these instruments expire without being used 
united is not involved in off balance sheet contractual relationships  other than those disclosed in this report  that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments  or that could significantly impact earnings 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on off balance sheet arrangements

united has historically retained earnings in order to provide capital for continued growth and expansion 
however  in recognition that cash dividends are an important component of shareholder return  management has targeted a long term payout ratio between and when earnings and capital levels permit 
in  united completed a public offering of its common stock to raise additional capital to support its balanced growth strategy 
through the offering  united issued  shares of its common stock and raised million in capital 
in addition to the common stock offering  united has a number of ongoing sources of equity capital to support its growth needs including a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan that allows existing shareholders to automatically reinvest all or a portion of their dividends in united s common stock or purchase additional shares directly from united without commissions or fees 
the federal reserve has issued guidelines for the implementation of risk based capital requirements by us banks and bank holding companies 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulators  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
the guidelines require an total risk based capital ratio  of which must be tier i capital 
tier i capital consists of shareholders equity  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income and intangible assets goodwill and deposit based intangibles  plus qualifying capital securities 
united s tier i capital totaled million at december  tier ii capital components include supplemental capital such as the qualifying portion of the allowance for loan losses and qualifying subordinated debt 
tier i capital plus tier ii capital components is referred to as total risk based capital and was million at december  the ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were and for tier i and total risk based capital  respectively  at december  united has outstanding junior subordinated debentures commonly referred to as trust preferred securities totaling million at december  the trust preferred securities qualify as tier i capital under risk based capital guidelines provided that total trust preferred securities do not exceed certain quantitative limits 
at december   all of united s trust preferred securities qualified as tier i capital

in  united issued million of convertible subordinated debentures due december  the debentures 
the holders of the debentures had the right  exercisable at any time up to december   to convert such debentures at the principal amount thereof into shares of common stock of united at the conversion price of per share 
all of the remaining outstanding debentures were converted to  shares of united s common stock on december  in  united issued million in subordinated notes due november  proceeds from the issuance were used for general business purposes 
the notes qualify as tier ii capital under risk based capital guidelines 
in  united issued million in subordinated step up notes due september  the subordinated notes qualify as tier ii capital under risk based capital guidelines 
the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of through september   and at a rate of thereafter until maturity or earlier redemption 
the notes are callable at par on september   and september of each year thereafter until maturity 
the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
a minimum leverage ratio is required in addition to the risk based capital standards and is defined as tier i capital divided by quarterly average assets reduced by the amount of goodwill and deposit based intangibles 
a minimum leverage ratio of is required for the highest rated bank holding companies which are not undertaking significant expansion programs  but the federal reserve board requires a bank holding company to maintain a leverage ratio greater than if it is experiencing or anticipating significant growth or is operating with less diversified risks in the opinion of the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board uses the leverage and risk based capital ratios to assess capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies 
management believes that united s capital must be well above the minimum capital requirements to maintain its business plan 
united s leverage ratio at december  was 
united monitors these capital ratios to ensure that united and the banks remain within regulatory guidelines 
further information regarding the actual and required capital ratios of united and the banks is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation and changing prices a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of a general business corporation in that primarily all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature  with relatively little investment in fixed assets or inventories 
inflation has an important impact on the growth of total assets and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than nominal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
united s management believes the impact of inflation on financial results depends on united s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
united has an asset liability management program to monitor and manage united s interest rate sensitivity position 
in addition  periodic reviews of banking services and products are conducted to adjust pricing in view of current and expected costs 
outlook management expects internally generated loan growth to continue within its targeted range of to through earnings per share are expected to grow at united s long term targeted range of to 
the net interest margin is expected to remain near the level 
the earnings outlook for is based on management s expectation of stable credit quality and stable interest rate and economic environments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity management the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant impact on united s profitability 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest revenue to changing interest rates  in order to achieve united s overall financial goals 
based on economic conditions  asset quality and various other considerations  management establishes tolerance ranges for interest rate sensitivity and manages within these ranges 
united s net interest revenue  and the fair value of its financial instruments  are influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
united manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by the alco 
the alco meets 
table of contents periodically and has responsibility for approving asset liability management policies  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and or earnings and reviewing united s interest rate sensitivity 
one of the tools management utilizes to estimate the sensitivity of net interest revenue to changes in interest rates is an interest rate simulation model 
such estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 
the simulation model measures the potential change in net interest revenue over a twelve month period under six interest rate scenarios 
the first scenario assumes rates remain flat over the next twelve months and is the scenario that all others are compared to in order to measure the change in net interest revenue 
the second scenario is a most likely scenario that projects the most likely change in rates over the next twelve months based on the slope of the yield curve 
united models ramp scenarios that assume gradual increases and decreases of basis points each over the next twelve months 
united has a policy for net interest revenue simulation based on rate movements of up basis points ramp over twelve months and down basis points ramp over twelve months from the flat rate scenario 
the policy limits the change in net interest revenue to a decrease in either scenario 
at december   united s simulation model indicated that a basis point increase in rates over the next twelve months would cause an approximate increase in net interest revenue and a basis point decrease in rates over the next twelve months would cause an approximate 
decrease in net interest revenue 
at december   united s simulation model indicated that a basis point increase in rates over the next twelve months would cause an approximate increase in net interest revenue and a basis point decrease in rates over the next twelve months would cause an approximate decrease in net interest revenue 
the decrease in sensitivity to falling interest rates from in the basis point rate decrease scenario results from a hedging program in the second half of whereby united entered into interest rate swap and floor contracts 
the following table shows interest sensitivity gaps for specified intervals 
table interest rate gap sensitivity as of december  in thousands interest sensitivity periods in months immediate to to to over total interest earning assets interest bearing deposits with banks investment securities mortgage loans held for sale loans other interest earning assets total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities now deposits money market deposits savings deposits time deposits fed funds purchased  repurchase agreements other short term borrowings fhlb advances other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest rate swaps  net non interest bearing sources of funds interest sensitivity gap cumulative sensitivity gap cumulative gap percent cumulative interest rate sensitivity position as a percent of total interest earning assets 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the portfolio of assets and liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity during the life of the instruments 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during periods of changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable timeframe  thereby minimizing the impact of interest rate changes on net interest revenue 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities in united s current portfolio that are subject to repricing at various time horizons immediate  one to three months  four to twelve months  one to five years  over five years  and on a cumulative basis 
the differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps 
as demonstrated in the preceding table  of interest bearing liabilities will reprice within twelve months compared with of interest earning assets  however such changes may not be proportionate with changes in market rates within each balance sheet category 
in addition  united may have some discretion in the extent and timing of deposit repricing depending upon the competitive pressures in the markets in which it operates 
changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly even when the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same  due to the two instruments repricing according to different indices 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities that are not reflected in the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis 
these prepayments may have significant impact on the net interest margin 
because of these limitations  an interest sensitivity gap analysis alone generally does not provide an accurate assessment of exposure to changes in interest rates

derivative financial instruments can be a cost effective and capital effective means of modifying the repricing characteristics of on balance sheet assets and liabilities 
these contracts consist of interest rate swaps under which united pays a variable rate and receives a fixed rate and interest rate floor contracts in which united pays a premium to a counterparty who agrees to pay united the difference between a variable rate and a strike rate if the variable rate falls below the strike rate

the changes in fair value of derivative instruments classified as cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income which amounts are reclassified into interest income over time as the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings 
fair value hedges recognize currently in earnings both the impact of change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument and the offsetting impact of the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability
