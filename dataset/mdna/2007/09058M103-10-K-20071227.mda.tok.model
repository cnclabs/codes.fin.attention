overview the business of bioanalytical systems  inc is largely dependent on the level of pharmaceutical and biotech companies efforts in new drug discovery and approval 
our services segment is the direct beneficiary of these efforts  through outsourcing by these companies of research work  and our products segment is the indirect beneficiary  as increased drug development leads to capital expansion providing opportunities to sell the equipment we produce and the consumable supplies we provide that support our products 
developments within the industries we serve have a direct  and sometimes material  impact on our operations 
currently  many large pharmaceutical companies have major block buster drugs that are nearing the end of their patent protections 
this puts significant pressure on these companies both to develop new drugs with large market appeal  and to re evaluate their cost structures and the time to market of their products 
contract research organizations cro s have benefited from these developments  as the pharmaceutical industry has turned to out sourcing to both reduce fixed costs  and to increase the speed of research and data development necessary for new drug applications 
the number of significant drugs that have reached or are nearing the end of their patent protection has also benefited the generic drug industry 
that sector of the drug industry has seen significant growth in the past decade  and  we believe  will continue to experience strong growth in the foreseeable future 
generic drug companies provide a significant source of new business for cro s as they develop  test and manufacture their generic compounds 
a significant portion of innovation in the pharmaceutical industry is now being driven by biotech and small  venture capital funded  drug development companies 
many of these companies are single molecule entities  whose success depends on one innovative compound 
while several of the biotech companies have reached the status of major pharmaceuticals  the industry is still characterized by smaller entities 
these developmental companies generally do not have the resources to perform much of the clinical research within their organizations  and are therefore dependent on the cro industry for both their research and for guidance in preparing their fda submissions 
these companies have provided significant new opportunities for the cro industry  including basi 
they do  however  provide challenges in selling  as they frequently have only one product in development  which causes cro s to be unable to develop a flow of projects from a single company 
these companies may expend all their available funds and cease operations prior to fully developing a product 
additionally  the funding of these companies is subject to investment market fluctuations  which changes with changes to the risk profile and appetite of investors 
although the past year has not seen large mergers in either the pharmaceutical or cro industries  consolidation continues at a smaller pace in the cro sector 
we believe that consolidation of the cro sector will continue to be a factor in our markets 
research services are capital intensive 
the investment in equipment and facilities to serve our markets is substantial and continuing 
while our physical facilities are excellent to meet market needs for the near term  rapid changes in automation  precision  speed and technologies necessitate a constant investment in equipment and software to meet market demands 
we are also impacted by the heightened regulatory environment and the need to improve our business infrastructure to support our increasingly diverse operations  which will necessitate additional capital investment 
our ability to generate capital to reinvest in our capabilities  both through operations and financial transactions  is critical to our success 
while we are currently committed to fully utilizing recent additions to our capacity  sustained growth will require additional investment in future periods 
results of operations the following table summarizes the consolidated statement of operations as a percentage of total revenues year ended september  service revenue product revenue total revenue cost of service revenue a cost of product revenue a total cost of revenue gross profit total operating expenses operating income loss other expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss a percentage of service and product revenues  respectively 
during  we changed our method of accounting for our inventories from the last in  first out lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method 
fiscal and have been retrospectively adjusted on a fifo basis 
compared to service and product revenues total revenue for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  service revenue increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   an increase of 
this increase was the result of growth in our toxicology business and a growth in our bioanalytical laboratories  offset by a decline in revenues of our clinical research unit 
the revenue decline in our clinical research unit was the result of the acquisition of its largest client  resulting in the cessation of research by them in our facility in fiscal as a consequence  we revalued the assets of that unit as of september   recording an impairment charge in the third quarter of that fiscal year discussed below 
we experienced strong demand in our pre clinical toxicology business in line with industry trends 
revenues in our bioanalytical laboratories were negatively impacted by product mix as the current year had a larger number of generic drug samples  at lower prices  compared to the prior year 
our revenues from products increased in the current year to million  a growth from last year s product revenues of million 
this growth stemmed mainly from new adopters of our culex system as well increased adoptions from our existing customers  which was impacted by a stronger sales and marketing effort in the current year 
our mature analytical instruments line continued prior trends of declining sales 
inflation in prices did not have a material impact on revenue increases 
costs of revenues costs of revenue increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this increase of million was due to a increases in the cost of service revenue as a result of the capacity added in our bioanalytical laboratories in fiscal which was not fully utilized in the current fiscal year as a result the lack of revenue growth in the current year  b increased staffing in our in vivo pharmacology unit as we increased our commercial offerings  and c additional costs in our toxicology business as a result of its growth 
cost of revenue as a percentage of revenues increased in the service segment due to the lower utilization of capacity 
a significant portion of our production costs are relatively fixed  which results in decreased margins as we decrease our utilization of facilities 
costs of revenue for our products segment increased to as a percentage of product revenue for the year ended september  from of product revenue for the year ended september  this increase is the result of continuing growth of sales of culex supplies which have a lower margin than the capital equipment 
operating expenses selling expenses for the year ended september  increased by to  from  during the year ended september   as we filled positions in our expanded sales group during the current year 
research and development expenses for the year ended september  decreased to from  for the year ended september  this decrease is primarily a result of our pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics pkpd services payroll costs being changed to cost of services in the current fiscal year  whereas they were included in research and development expenses in the prior fiscal year due to the commercialization of main products 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  decreased to  from  for the year ended september  the major contributors to our cost reduction in the current year were the strategic reductions in personnel approximately in which reduced costs at all locations for included in these expenses in the current year is approximately of severance costs for former officers of the company 
in our third fiscal quarter of the prior year  we determined that  due to the loss of a significant customer in our baltimore clinical research unit  there had been a permanent impairment in the value of its assets 
the million impairment loss is shown as a separate line item in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal other income expense other income expense  net  was for the year ended september  as compared to  in the year ended september  this decline is due to our lower average outstanding borrowings between the comparable years 
this expense was offset by interest income of in fiscal as compared to in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to higher interest rates available on short term cash investments and higher average cash balances to invest during the year ended september  compared to the previous fiscal year 
income taxes we computed our income taxes using an effective tax rate of on domestic earnings for the year ended september  we did not provide income taxes on foreign earnings due to the availability of net operating loss carryforwards to offset our taxable income  which have not previously been recognized for financial statement purposes due to the uncertainty of future utilization 
the income tax benefit for the year ended september  was computed using the effective rate of net income in summary  the combined result of slightly higher revenue and significantly lower operating expenses resulted in net income for fiscal of  or per basic and diluted share  as compared to a net loss in fiscal of  or per basic and diluted share 
compared to service and product revenues total revenue for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  service revenue increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   an increase of 
this increase was the result of growth in our toxicology business  offset by a decline in revenues of our clinical research unit 
revenues in our bioanalytical laboratories were essentially flat compared to the prior year 
the revenue decline in our clinical research unit was the result of the acquisition of its largest client  resulting in the cessation of research by them in our facility 
as a consequence  we revalued the assets of that unit  recording an impairment charge in the third quarter of our fiscal year discussed below 
revenues in our bioanalytical laboratories were negatively impacted by delays in critical projects by our clients 
our revenues from products declined in fiscal to million  a decline from fiscal s product revenues of million 
this decline was across our product line 
in the fiscal year ended september   we did not have any major new adopters of our culex system  which resulted in flat year to year sales 
our mature analytical instruments line continued prior trends of declining sales 
inflation in prices did not have a material impact on revenue increases 
costs of revenues costs of revenue increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this increase of million was due to a increases in the cost of service revenue as a result of the capacity added in our bioanalytical laboratories in fiscal which was not fully utilized in the current fiscal year as a result the lack of revenue growth in the current year  b increased staffing in our in vivo pharmacology unit as we increased our commercial offerings  and c additional costs in our toxicology business as a result of its growth 
cost of revenue as a percentage of revenues increased in both service and product segments due to the lower utilization of capacity 
a significant portion of our production costs are relatively fixed  which results in decreased margins as we decrease our utilization of facilities 
costs of revenue for our products segment increased to as a percentage of product revenue for the year ended september  from of product revenue for the year ended september  operating expenses selling expenses for the year ended september  increased by to  from  during the year ended september   as we filled positions in our expanded sales group during the year 
research and development expenses for the year ended september  increased to  from  for the year ended september  this increase is primarily due to additional research activities around our culex product line 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  increased to  from  for the year ended september  in september of  in order to address our lack of profitability  we reduced our headcount by approximately  which resulted in severance costs of in the fiscal  we began expensing employee stock options  increasing expenses by our provision for bad debts increased by  principally the result of one contract that we were not able to collect 
increases in our costs of health insurance  property taxes  outside audit  and additional administrative support of our growth in toxicology were major contributors to the remainder of the increase 
in our third quarter of fiscal  we determined that  due to the loss of a significant customer in our baltimore clinical research unit  there had been a permanent impairment in the value of its assets 
the million impairment loss is shown as a separate line item in our consolidated statement of operations 
other income expense other income expense  net  was  for the year ended september  as compared to in the year ended september   as a result of increased interest expense 
we reduced our average outstanding borrowings on both our revolving line of credit and our mortgage financing  while adding million of lease financing to acquire laboratory equipment 
income taxes our effective tax rate was for the benefits of our loss for fiscal net income in summary  only slightly higher revenue  more than offset by higher cost of revenue  increased general and administrative expenses and a significant impairment loss resulted in a net loss of per share in fiscal  both basic and diluted  compared to a net loss in fiscal of per share  both basic and diluted 
liquidity and capital resources comparative cash flow analysis since inception  our principal sources of cash have been cash flow generated from operations and funds received from bank borrowings and other financings 
at september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at september  we generated million of cash from operating activities for the year ended september   compared to cash generated of million in fiscal and cash used of million in fiscal cash generated was primarily from net income of million for the full year as compared to net losses in fiscal years and plus employee stock option expense of in  offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
non cash charges to operations of million for depreciation and amortization increased our expenses  but did not consume cash 
our receivables vary depending on where we stand in our mix of contracts  however  we believe that new procedures instituted during the current year in billings and collections contributed to the improved cash flow 
for fiscal  we used million from investing activities as compared to cash used of million and cash provided of million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
during fiscal  we sold and leased back the majority of our facility in baltimore 
with a sales price of million  this transaction resulted in net cash of million  after expenses  helping finance the million investment in capital assets in the fiscal in fiscal years and  our investments were in recurring capital asset additions and replacements with million less used in capital spending in fiscal versus fiscal cash used by financing activities was million for the year ended september   compared to cash used of and cash used of million  respectively for fiscal and cash utilized in fiscal was used for payment of debt and lease obligations similar to fiscal years and  slightly offset by of proceeds from stock option exercises 
cash used was lower in due to the paydown of the line of credit in fiscal capital resources property and equipment spending totaled million  million funded by proceeds from the sale of the baltimore building  and million funded by funds generated from operations  long term debt and revolving credit  in fiscal  and  respectively 
expenditures in fiscal and were primarily for the purchase of laboratory equipment 
the decline in capital expenditures in fiscal and is the result of the completion of expansion programs in fiscal to the west lafayette and evansville  indiana facilities 
capital investments for the purchase of additional laboratory equipment are driven by anticipated increases in research services  and by the replacement or upgrading of our equipment 
additionally  we funded million of laboratory equipment in fiscal through capital leases 
although we may consider strategic acquisition opportunities  we do not intend to aggressively pursue additional acquisitions until we fully utilize existing capacity 
we amended our revolving credit facility in october  reducing our line of credit to million from million as we did not have qualifying assets sufficient to borrow the higher amount and were paying fees on amounts we could not use 
we also have three mortgage notes payable to another bank aggregating million 
borrowings under these credit agreements are collateralized by substantially all assets related to our operations and all common stock of our us subsidiaries and of the common stock of our non united states subsidiaries 
under the terms of these credit agreements  we have agreed to restrict advances to subsidiaries  limit additional indebtedness and capital expenditures as well as to comply with certain financial covenants outlined in the borrowing agreements 
these credit agreements contain cross default provisions 
details of each debt issue are discussed below 
we were in compliance with our loan covenants at september  and expect to be in compliance with the loan covenants in the future 
the maximum amount available under the terms of our amended revolving line of credit is million with outstanding borrowings limited to the borrowing base as defined in the amendment to the agreement 
as of september  there were no outstanding balances on this line of credit 
borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at a variable rate based on the london interbank offer rate libor or a base rate determined by the lender s prime rate plus an applicable margin  as defined in the agreement 
the applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving facility ranges from to for base rate borrowings and to for libor borrowings  subject to adjustment based on the average availability under the revolving facility 
the company also pays a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility ranging from 
all interest and fees are paid monthly 
borrowings under the facility are based on a lending formula utilizing accounts receivable and inventory 
at september   we had million available under the facility after offsetting a million outstanding letter of credit which secures the baltimore lease 
this letter of credit expires in january and will not be required to be renewed under the terms of our new lease 
the line of credit is a revolver against which we apply cash receipts  and draws cash as needed 
the line of credit is committed until december  we have three outstanding mortgages with a commercial bank on our facilities in west lafayette and evansville  indiana  which total million 
two of the mortgages mature in november   while the other matures in may as of june  the mortgages have a floating interest rate currently at 
we have a commitment from our bank to renew the mortgage due in may for an additional five years on essentially the same terms 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes the cash payments under our contractual term debt and lease obligations at september  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future fiscal periods amounts in thousands 
the table does not include our revolving line of credit 
additional information on the subordinated debt is described in note  debt arrangements 
after total mortgage notes payable subordinated debt capital lease obligations operating leases subordinated debt includes notes to related parties 
we anticipate spending approximately million in fiscal on capital assets  primarily laboratory equipment which will be financed using capital leases 
we have committed to funding tenant improvements on our new lease in the uk  along with other commitments at september  that total approximately million 
the covenants in our credit agreement require the maintenance of certain ratios of interest bearing indebtedness not including subordinated debt to ebitda and net cash flow to debt servicing requirements  which may restrict the amount we can borrow to fund future operations  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
based on current business activities  we believe cash generated from operations and amounts available under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future and through september  we have million of subordinated convertible notes maturing in january  we intend to use proceeds from a mortgage and cash on hand to pay the notes principal on january  if necessary  we may use a portion of our existing line of credit to make up the remaining balance 
at this time  we do not anticipate the need to borrow on the line of credit to pay the note balance 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and liquidity and capital resources discusses the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and are considered critical accounting policies 
we have identified the following areas as critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition the majority of our service contracts involve the processing of bioanalytical samples for pharmaceutical companies 
these contracts generally provide for a fixed fee for each assay method developed or sample processed and revenue is recognized under the specific performance method of accounting 
under the specific performance method  revenue and related direct costs are recognized when services are performed 
other service contracts generally consist of preclinical and clinical trial studies for pharmaceutical companies 
service revenue is recognized based on the ratio of direct costs incurred to total estimated direct costs under the proportional performance method of accounting 
losses on contracts are provided in the period in which the loss becomes determinable 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected on a cumulative basis in the period in which such revisions become known 
the establishment of contract prices and total contract costs involves estimates made by the company at the inception of the contract period 
these estimates could change during the term of the contract which could impact the revenue and costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
projected losses on contracts are provided for in their entirety when known 
revisions to estimates have not been material 
service contract fees received upon acceptance are deferred and classified within customer advances  until earned 
unbilled revenues represent revenues earned under contracts in advance of billings 
our product revenue is derived primarily from sales of equipment utilized for scientific research 
revenue from equipment not requiring installation  testing or training is recognized upon shipment to customers 
one product includes internally developed software and requires installation  testing and training  which occur concurrently 
revenue from this product is recognized upon completion of the installation  testing and training 
impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  collectively referred to as indefinite lived assets  are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps 
first  we determine the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount 
second  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s indefinite lived assets over the implied fair value of those indefinite lived assets 
the implied fair value of the indefinite lived assets is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s indefinite lived assets 
our baltimore clinical research unit was acquired in a business combination in fiscal although improvement has been achieved in operating results since acquisition  the acquisition of one of its major customers by a company that had other clinical study providers  and the subsequent cancellation of previously scheduled studies seriously impacted operating results in fiscal consequently  in the third quarter of fiscal  we determined that there was a permanent impairment of value of the assets acquired  and recorded an impairment loss of  to write down the value of property and equipment  other intangible assets and the value of goodwill 
we also recorded a deferred tax benefit of related to these charges 
the clinical research unit is included in the services segment in the financial statements and footnotes 
stock based compensation on october   we changed our accounting to recognize the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions in our financial statements using a fair value based method versus the previously used method in which no expense was recorded in the financial statements 
we elected to use the modified prospective transition method of adoption 
we measured compensation cost for all outstanding unvested stock based awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated fair values and recognized compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
we recognized and of stock based compensation related to employee stock options during the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
we use the binomial option valuation model to determine the grant date fair value 
the binomial option valuation model requires us to make certain assumptions about the future 
the determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding subjective and complex variables such as expected employee exercise behavior and our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award 
generally  our assumptions are based on historical information and judgment is required to determine if historical trends may be indicators of future outcomes 
we estimated the following key assumptions for the binomial valuation calculation risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
expected volatility 
we use our historical stock price volatility and consider the implied volatility computed based on the price of short term options publicly traded on our common stock for our expected volatility assumption 
expected term 
the expected term represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term is determined based on historical exercise behavior  post vesting termination patterns  options outstanding and future expected exercise behavior 
expected dividends 
we assumed that we will pay no dividends 
employee stock based compensation expense recognized in fiscal and was calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates and an adjustment will be recognized at that time 
changes to our underlying stock price  our assumptions used in the binomial option valuation calculation and our forfeiture rate as well as future grants of equity could significantly impact compensation expense to be recognized in fiscal and future periods 
income tax accounting income taxes are accounted for by recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these deferred taxes are measured by applying the provisions of tax laws expected to be in effect at the time the differences reverse 
we recognize deferred tax assets on the balance sheet  which typically represents items deducted currently in the financial statements that will be deducted in future periods in tax returns 
a valuation allowance  if necessary  is recorded against these deferred tax assets to reduce the total deferred tax assets to an amount that will  more likely than not  be realized in future periods 
the valuation allowance is based  in part  on management s estimate of future taxable income  the expected utilization of tax loss carry forwards and the expiration dates of tax loss carry forwards 
significant assumptions are used in developing the analysis of future taxable income for purposes of determining the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets which  in the opinion of management  are reasonable under the circumstances 
we have an accumulated net deficit in our uk subsidiaries  consequently  united states deferred tax liabilities on such earnings have not been recorded 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo cost method of accounting 
prior to  our inventories were accounted for using the last in  first out lifo method of accounting 
during the fourth quarter of  we changed our method of accounting for inventories from the lifo method to the fifo method 
the fifo method of inventory accounting better matches revenues and expenses in accordance with sales contract terms 
all periods presented have been retrospectively adjusted on a fifo basis 
new accounting pronouncements we adopted the following two pronouncements for periods beginning october  in november   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
dealing with inventory costs 
the statement clarifies what costs can be included in inventory  requiring that absorption factors be based on normal capacities of manufacturing facilities and excess capacity be expensed as incurred 
our historical costing methodology substantially conformed with this standard  therefore  we did not experience any change from this pronouncement 
in december   sfas no 
revised was issued dealing with share based payments 
in general  this statement requires that companies compute the fair value of options and other stock based employee incentives  charging this value to operations over the period earned  generally the vesting period 
we incurred expenses  net of tax benefit  of and in fiscal and  respectively see notes and to the consolidated financial statements relating to our stock option plans 
the following recent pronouncements may impact the company s accounting policies in july  the fasb released interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this interpretation revises the recognition tests for tax positions taken in tax returns such that a tax benefit is recorded only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be allowed upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount of such a tax benefit to record is the largest amount that is more likely than not to be allowed 
any reduction in deferred tax assets or increase in tax liabilities upon adoption will correspondingly reduce retained earnings 
we do not expect the adoption of this interpretation  which is effective for our fiscal year beginning october   to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin  dealing with the methods of measuring misstatements when determining materiality to the financial statements 
we have been using such methods since the sab was issued item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is the changes in interest rates 
we have a revolving credit agreement with national city bank  bearing interest at a rate of either the bank s prime rate plus basis points  or at libor plus basis points  depending in each case upon the ratio of our interest bearing indebtedness less subordinated debt to ebitda 
historically  we have not used derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
hypothetically  we believe that a adverse change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated operating results 
interest on our revolving line of credit and our real estate mortgages are at floating rates 
because we operate internationally  we are subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the effect of movements in the exchange rates was not material to our consolidated operating results for fiscal years  and a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not materially affect our consolidated operating results
