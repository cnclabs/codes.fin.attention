employees as of april   we employed approximately  people 
none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory 
governmental regulations the gaming and racing industries are highly regulated  and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations 
each of our facilities is subject to extensive regulation under the laws  rules and regulations of the jurisdiction where it is located 
these laws  rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility  financial stability and character of the owners  managers and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations 
violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions 
a more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in exhibit to the annual report on form k  which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference 
our businesses are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations 
these laws and regulations include  but are not limited to  restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages  environmental matters  employees  currency transactions  taxation  zoning and building codes  and marketing and advertising 
such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future  or new laws and regulations could be enacted

risk factors 
risk factors we face significant competition from other gaming operations that could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
we face intense competition in the markets in which we operate 
we have numerous competitors  including land based casinos  dockside casinos  riverboat casinos  casinos located on native american owned lands and at racing and pari mutuel operations 
several of our competitors have substantially better name recognition  marketing and financial resources than we do 
legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the united states 
certain states have recently legalized  and other states are currently considering legalizing  casino gaming in designated areas 
there is no limit on the number of gaming licenses that may be granted in several of the markets in which we operate 
as a result  new licenses could be awarded to gaming facilities in such markets  which could allow new gaming operators to enter such markets and have an adverse effect on our operating results 
expansion of existing gaming facilities and the development of new gaming facilities in our current markets will increase competition for our existing and future operations 
in addition  many native american tribes conduct casino gaming on native american owned lands throughout the united states 
such facilities have the advantages of being land based and exempt from certain state and federal taxes and operational restrictions imposed by state gaming authorities 
some native american tribes are either in the process of establishing or expanding  or are considering the establishment or expansion of  gaming in oklahoma  texas  louisiana  florida  alabama  kansas  colorado  mississippi and iowa 
the establishment or expansion of new gaming facilities and casinos on native american owned lands will increase competition for our existing and future gaming facilities in proximity to native american owned lands 
we also compete with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as online computer gambling  bingo  pull tab games  card parlors  sports books  cruise to nowhere operations  pari mutuel or telephonic betting on horse racing and dog racing  state sponsored lotteries  jai alai  video lottery terminals and video poker terminals and  in the future  may compete with gaming at other venues 
our existing gaming facilities compete directly with other gaming properties in louisiana  mississippi  missouri  iowa  florida and colorado 
we also compete with gaming operators in other gaming jurisdictions such as atlantic city  new jersey and las vegas  nevada 
our existing casinos attract a significant number of their customers from houston  texas  mobile  alabama  kansas city  missouri  southern florida  little rock  arkansas and denver  colorado 
our continued success depends upon drawing customers from each of these geographic markets 
legalization of gaming in jurisdictions closer to these geographic markets than the jurisdictions in which our facilities are located would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in that regard  the kansas legislature recently authorized casinos in several locations throughout the state of kansas  including two in the kansas city  kansas area 
we expect competition to increase as new gaming operators enter our markets  existing competitors expand their operations  gaming activities expand in existing jurisdictions and gaming is legalized in new jurisdictions 
we cannot predict with any certainty the effects of existing and future competition on our operating results 
we are subject to extensive regulation from gaming authorities that could adversely affect us 
as owners and operators of gaming facilities  we are subject to extensive state and local regulation 
state and local authorities require us and our subsidiaries to demonstrate suitability to obtain and retain various licenses and require that we have registrations  permits and approvals to conduct gaming operations 
the regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate may limit  condition  suspend or revoke a license to conduct gaming operations or prevent us from owning the securities of any of our gaming subsidiaries 
we may also be deemed responsible for the acts and conduct of our employees 
substantial fines or forfeiture of assets for violations of gaming laws or regulations may be levied against us  our subsidiaries and the persons involved 
the suspension or revocation of any of our licenses or the levy on us or our subsidiaries of a substantial fine would have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents 
index to financial statements to date  we have demonstrated suitability to obtain and have obtained all governmental licenses  registrations  permits and approvals necessary for us to operate our existing gaming facilities 
however  like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate  we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals 
in addition  regulatory authorities in certain jurisdictions must approve  in advance  any restrictions on transfers of  agreements not to encumber or pledges of equity securities issued by a corporation that is registered as an intermediary company with such state  or that holds a gaming license 
if these restrictions are not approved in advance  they will be invalid 
from time to time  legislators and special interest groups have proposed legislation that would expand  restrict or prevent gaming operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  from time to time  certain anti gaming groups have challenged constitutional amendments or legislation that would limit our ability to continue to operate in those jurisdictions in which these constitutional amendments or legislation have been adopted 
for example  florida district court of appeal first district recently affirmed its earlier decision to reverse a lower court decision granting summary judgment in favor of floridians for a level playing field flpf  of which we are a member 
although the court based its decision on different grounds than its earlier decision  the court ruled that a trial is necessary to determine whether flpf failed to obtain the required number of signatures to place the constitutional amendment on the ballot 
however  the court granted flpf s request to certify flpf s appeal of the court s decision to the supreme court 
on march   the supreme court of florida released an order accepting jurisdiction to review the district court of appeal s earlier decision 
we believe that the appeal s court decision is contrary to existing florida law and if a trial were to be held  that flpf would prevail on the merits 
however  if flpf is ultimately unsuccessful in the litigation  the statewide vote amending the florida constitution to permit slot machines at pari mutuels could be invalidated and our right to operate slot machines at pompano park could be eliminated 
we cannot assure you as to the outcome of this litigation 
we are subject to the possibility of an increase in gaming taxes  which would increase our costs 
state and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities 
we believe that the prospect of significant revenue is one of the primary reasons that jurisdictions permit legalized gaming 
as a result  gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal  state  local and provincial income taxes  and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time 
we pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations 
from time to time  federal  state  local and provincial legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws  or in the administration of such laws  affecting the gaming industry 
in addition  poor economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes 
some of the states in which we own or operate casinos continue to experience budget shortfalls and  as a result  may increase gaming taxes to raise more revenue 
we cannot determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws 
such changes  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to non gaming regulation that could adversely affect us 
several of our riverboats must comply with us coast guard requirements as to boat design  on board facilities  equipment  personnel and safety and must hold us coast guard certificates of documentation and inspection 
the us coast guard requirements also set limits on the operation of the riverboats and mandate licensing of certain personnel involved with the operation of the riverboats 
loss of a riverboat s certificate of documentation and inspection could preclude its use as a riverboat casino 
each of our riverboats is inspected annually and  every five years  is subject to dry docking for inspection of its hull  which could result in a temporary loss of service 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we are required to have third parties periodically inspect and certify all of our casino barges for stability and single compartment flooding integrity 
our casino barges must also meet local fire safety standards 
we would incur additional costs if any of our gaming facilities were not in compliance with one or more of these regulations 
we are also subject to certain federal  state and local environmental laws  regulations and ordinances that apply to non gaming businesses generally  such as the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation recovery act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and the oil pollution act of under various federal  state and local laws and regulations  an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property  regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of  or is responsible for  the presence of such substances or wastes 
we have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on us or the results of our operations 
however  several of our properties are located in industrial areas or were used for industrial purposes for many years 
as a consequence  it is possible that historical or neighboring activities have affected one or more of our properties and that  as a result  environmental issues could arise in the future  the precise nature of which we cannot now predict 
the coverage and attendant compliance costs associated with these laws  regulations and ordinances may result in future additional costs 
regulations adopted by the financial crimes enforcement network of the us treasury department require us to report currency transactions in excess of  occurring within a gaming day  including identification of the patron by name and social security number 
us treasury department regulations also require us to report certain suspicious activity  including any transaction that exceeds  if we know  suspect or have reason to believe that the transaction involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements 
substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with these regulations 
we are also subject to a variety of other local rules and regulations  including zoning  environmental  construction and land use laws and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages 
penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with these regulations 
the imposition of a substantial penalty or the loss of service of a gaming facility for a significant period of time would have a material adverse affect on our business 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and restrict our operations 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
as of april   we had billion of total debt outstanding 
our significant indebtedness could have important consequences  such as limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital requirements  capital expenditures  debt service  general corporate or other obligations  limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness  increasing our interest expense if there is a rise in interest rates  because a portion of our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are subject to interest rate periods with short term durations typically to days that require ongoing refunding at the then current rates of interest  causing our failure to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants contained in the indenture and agreements governing the senior subordinated notes due  the senior subordinated notes due  collectively the notes  our senior secured credit facility and our other indebtedness  which could cause a default under those instruments and which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us  
table of contents 
index to financial statements placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors who are not as highly leveraged  and increasing our vulnerability to and limiting our ability to react to changing market conditions  changes in our industry and economic downturns 
any of the factors listed above could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
despite our significant indebtedness  we may still be able to incur significantly more debt 
this could intensify the risks described above 
the terms of the indenture and agreements governing the notes  our senior secured credit facility and our other indebtedness limit  but do not prohibit  us or our subsidiaries from incurring significant additional indebtedness in the future 
in addition  as of april   we had the capacity to issue additional indebtedness  including the ability to incur additional indebtedness under all of our lines of credit  of approximately million  of which  million related to the isle black hawk senior secured credit facility  
million related to the blue chip credit facility and million related to senior secured credit facility 
refer to footnote  long term debt  for additional discussion on the credit facilities 
approximately million of these lines of credit were used to support letters of credit 
our capacity to issue additional indebtedness is subject to the limitations imposed by the covenants in our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our notes 
the indenture governing our notes and our senior secured credit facility contain financial and other restrictive covenants  but will not fully prohibit us from incurring additional debt 
if new debt is added to our current level of indebtedness  related risks that we now face could increase 
restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness may prevent us from pursuing business strategies that could otherwise improve our results of operations 
we have made and will need to make significant capital expenditures at our existing facilities to remain competitive with current and future competitors in our markets 
our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our notes contain operating and financial restrictions that may limit our ability to obtain the financing to make these capital expenditures 
our agreements governing our indebtedness  among other things  limit our ability to borrow money  make capital expenditures  use assets as security in other transactions  make restricted payments or restricted investments  incur contingent obligations  and sell assets and enter into leases and transactions with affiliates 
we may not be able to successfully expand to new locations or recover our investment in new properties which would adversely affect our operations and available resources 
we regularly evaluate and pursue new gaming acquisition and development opportunities in existing and new gaming markets 
to the extent that we elect to pursue any new gaming acquisition or development opportunity  our ability to benefit from our investment will depend on many factors  including our ability to successfully identify attractive acquisition and development opportunities  our ability to successfully operate any developed or acquired properties  our ability to attract and retain competent management and employees for the new locations  
table of contents 
index to financial statements our ability to secure required federal  state and local licenses  permits and approvals  which in some jurisdictions are limited in number and subject to intense competition and  the availability of adequate financing on acceptable terms 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
therefore  we cannot be sure that we will be able to recover our investments in any new gaming development opportunities or acquired facilities  or successfully expand to additional locations 
we may experience construction delays during our expansion or development projects which could adversely affect our operations 
we currently are engaged in substantial expansion projects at several of our properties 
we also evaluate other expansion opportunities as they become available and we may in the future engage in additional construction projects 
the anticipated costs and construction periods are based upon budgets  conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with our architects and contractors 
construction projects entail significant risks  which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project 
such risks include shortages of materials or skilled labor  unforeseen engineering  environmental or geological problems  work stoppages  weather interference and unanticipated cost increases 
most of these factors are beyond our control 
in addition  difficulties or delays in obtaining any of the requisite licenses  permits or authorizations from regulatory authorities can increase the cost or delay the completion of an expansion or development 
significant budget overruns or delays with respect to expansion and development projects could adversely affect our results of operations 
if our key personnel leave us  our business could be adversely affected 
our continued success will depend  among other things  on the efforts and skills of a few key executive officers and the experience of our property managers as well as our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel with gaming industry experience and qualifications to obtain the requisite licenses 
we do not maintain key man life insurance for any of our employees 
there is no assurance that we would be able to attract and hire suitable replacements for any of our key employees 
we need qualified executives  managers and skilled employees with gaming industry experience to continue to successfully operate our business 
we believe a shortage of skilled labor in the gaming industry may make it increasingly difficult and expensive to attract and retain qualified employees 
we expect that increased competition in the gaming industry will intensify this problem 
inclement weather and other conditions could seriously disrupt our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dockside and riverboat facilities are subject to risks in addition to those associated with land based casinos  including loss of service due to casualty  mechanical failure  extended or extraordinary maintenance  flood  hurricane or other severe weather 
our riverboats and barges face additional risks from the movement of vessels on waterways 
reduced patronage and the loss of a dockside or riverboat casino from service for any period of time could adversely affect our results of operations 
for example  as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita  we closed the isle biloxi from august  to december  and the isle lake charles from september  to october  while our business interruption insurance provided sufficient coverage for those losses  we cannot be sure that the proceeds from any future claim will be sufficient to compensate us if one or more of our casinos experience a closure 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in fiscal  as a result of hurricane claims in the gulf coast region over the past several years  we have experienced a significant increase in property and business interruption premiums 
access to a number of our facilities may also be affected by road conditions  such as construction and traffic 
in addition  severe weather such as high winds and blizzards occasionally limits access to our facilities in colorado 
energy and fuel price increases may adversely affect our costs of operations and our revenues our casino properties use significant amounts of electricity  natural gas and other forms of energy 
while no shortages of energy have been experienced  substantial increases in the cost of electricity in the united states will negatively affect our results of operations 
in addition  energy and fuel price increases in cities that constitute a significant source of customers for our properties could result in a decline in disposable income of potential customers and a corresponding decrease in visitation to our properties  which would negatively impact our revenues 
the extent of the impact is subject to the magnitude and duration of the energy and fuel price increases  but this impact could be material 
a downturn in general economic conditions may adversely affect our results of operations 
our business operations are subject to changes in international  national and local economic conditions  including changes in the economy related to future security alerts in connection with threatened or actual terrorist attacks and related to the war with iraq  which may affect our customers willingness to travel 
a recession or downturn in the general economy  or in a region constituting a significant source of customers for our properties  could result in fewer customers visiting our properties  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
we have international operations that are subject to different risks than our domestic operations 
in the united kingdom and the bahamas  we are subject to certain additional risks  including difficulty in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  foreign currency fluctuations  dependence on foreign economies  political issues  adverse tax consequences and uncertainty in regulatory reform in the united kingdom 
in addition  in the bahamas current gaming regulation preclude residents from participating in gaming activities 
therefore  disruptions in tourism traffic due to issues such as increased costs and or reduced availability of airline and other means of transportation and hotel accommodations can have an adverse impact in our gaming operations 
we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and may not be able to report timely and accurate financial results 
we have identified several material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and have restated our results for the years ended through april  and the related quarterly results therein  and the first three fiscal quarters ended january  we cannot be assured that additional material weaknesses  significant deficiencies and control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future 
we could incur substantial expenses relating to the remediation of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
our efforts to remediate the remaining material weakness may take longer than anticipated and result in a continued material weaknesses in our system of internal control over financial reporting 
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the future could be impacted by a variety of factors  including faulty human judgment  simple errors  omissions or mistakes  and the possibility that any enhancements to disclosure controls and procedures may still not be adequate to assure timely and accurate financial information 
if we fail to achieve and maintain effective controls and procedures for financial reporting  we could be unable to provide timely and accurate financial information 
this may cause us to fail to satisfy the reporting requirements with our lenders and give rise to an event of default or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information 
this may also have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition to the foregoing  you should consider each of the factors set forth in this annual report in evaluating our business and our prospects 
the factors described in our part item a are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the risks actually occur  our business and financial results could be harmed 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline
