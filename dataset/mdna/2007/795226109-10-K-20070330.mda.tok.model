competition the company and the bank encounter competition in all phases of their business 
there are numerous financial institutions that have offices in the areas in which the company and bank compete in northwestern connecticut  western massachusetts and proximate areas of new york state 
the offices of the bank are located in the northwest corner of litchfield county  connecticut and south berkshire county  massachusetts 
the bank maintains six banking offices within these two counties and also attracts customers from nearby columbia county and dutchess county  new york 
the bank s market area within the four counties is served by commercial banks and savings banks 
banks compete on the basis of price  including rates paid on deposits and charged on borrowings  convenience and quality of service 
savings and loan associations are able to compete aggressively with commercial banks in the important area of consumer lending 
credit unions and small loan companies are significant factors in the consumer market 
insurance companies  investment firms  credit and mortgage companies  brokerage firms cash management accounts  money market funds and retailers are all significant competitors for various types of business 
insurance companies  investment counseling firms and other businesses and individuals actively compete with the bank for personal and corporate trust services and investment counseling services 
many non bank competitors are not subject to the extensive regulation described below under legislation  regulation and supervision and in certain respects may have a competitive advantage over banks in providing certain services 
in marketing its services  the bank emphasizes its position as a hometown bank with personal service  flexibility and prompt responsiveness to the needs of its customers 
moreover  the bank competes for both deposits and loans by offering competitive rates and convenient business hours 
in addition to providing banking services to customers in its primary service areas  the bank is a member of the automatic teller machine networks and offers internet banking services  which allow the bank to deliver certain financial services to customers regardless of their proximity to the primary service area of the bank 
connecticut has enacted legislation that liberalizes banking powers for thrift institutions thereby improving their competitive position with other banks 
in addition  the connecticut interstate banking and branching act permits acquisitions and mergers of connecticut banks and bank holding companies with banks and bank holding companies in other states 
accordingly  it is possible for large super regional organizations to enter many new markets  including the market served by the bank 
certain competitors  by virtue of their size and resources  may enjoy certain efficiencies and competitive advantages over the bank in the pricing  delivery  and marketing of their products and services 
it is possible that such legislative authority will increase the number or the size of financial institutions competing with the bank for deposits and loans in its market place  although it is impossible to predict the effect upon competition of such legislation 
legislation  regulation and supervision general virtually every aspect of the business of banking is subject to regulation  including such matters as the amount of reserves that must be established against various deposits  the establishment of branches  mergers  non banking activities and other operations 
numerous laws and regulations also set forth special restrictions and procedural requirements with respect to the extension of credit  credit practices  the disclosure of credit terms and discrimination in credit transactions 
the descriptions of the statutory provisions and regulations applicable to banks set forth below do not purport to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the bank 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently introduced in congress  in the state legislatures and before the various bank regulatory agencies 
the likelihood and timing of any changes and the impact such changes might have on the bank s future business and earnings are difficult to determine 
federal reserve board regulation the company is a registered bank holding company under the bank holding company act of  as amended the bhca 
it is subject to the supervision and examination of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve board and files with the federal reserve board the reports as required under the bhca 
the bhca generally requires prior approval by the federal reserve board of the acquisition by the company of substantially all of the assets or more than five percent of the voting stock of any bank 
the bhca also allows the federal reserve board to determine by order or by regulation what activities are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident of banking  and thus  whether the company can engage in such activities 
the bhca prohibits the company and the bank from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  sale of property or furnishing of services 
federal legislation permits adequately capitalized bank holding companies to venture across state lines to offer banking services through bank subsidiaries to a wide geographic market 
it is possible for large super regional organizations to enter many new markets  including the market served by the bank  although it is impossible to assess what impact this will have on the company or the bank 
the federal reserve act imposes certain restrictions on loans by the bank to the company and certain other activities  on investments in their stock or securities  and on the taking by the bank of such stock or securities as collateral security for loans to any borrower 
under the bhca and the regulations of the federal reserve system promulgated thereunder regulation y  no corporation may become a bank holding company as defined therein  without prior approval of the federal reserve board 
the company received the approval to become a bank holding company on june  the company will also have to secure prior approval of the federal reserve board if it wishes to acquire voting shares of any other bank  if after such acquisition it would own or control more than five percent of the voting share of such bank 
the bhca imposes limitations upon the company as to the types of business in which it may engage 
regulation y requires bank holding companies to provide the federal reserve board with written notice before purchasing or redeeming equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption  when aggregated with the net consideration paid by the company for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months  is equal to ten percent or more of the company s consolidated net worth 
for purposes of regulation y  net consideration is the gross consideration paid by a company for all of its equity securities purchased or redeemed during the period  minus the gross consideration received for all of its equity securities sold during the period other than as part of a new issue 
however  a bank holding company need not obtain federal reserve board approval of any equity security redemption when i the bank holding company s capital ratios exceed the threshold established for well capitalized state member banks before and immediately after the redemption  ii the bank holding company is well managed  and iii the bank holding company is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues 
gramm leach bliley act the gramm leach bliley financial services modernization act of the glba  provides bank holding companies  banks  securities firms  insurance companies  and investment management firms the option of engaging in a broad range of financial and related activities by opting to become a financial holding company 
the company qualified and registered as a financial holding company on may  financial holding companies are subject to oversight by the federal reserve board  in addition to other regulatory agencies 
under the financial holding company structure  bank holding companies have greater ability to purchase or establish nonbank subsidiaries  that are financial in nature or that engage in activities incidental or complementary to a financial activity 
additionally  pursuant to the glba  securities and insurance firms are permitted to purchase full service banks 
while the glba facilitates the ability of financial institutions to offer a wide range of financial services  large financial institutions would appear to be the beneficiaries as a result of this act because many community banks lack the capital and management resources needed to facilitate broad expansion of financial services

risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this report  the following risks may affect the company 
if any of these risks occurs  the company s business  financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 
the company s business and financial condition is directly affected by the bank s business and financial condition and  thus  is subject to certain risks of the bank 
changes in economic conditions could materially negatively impact the company s business 
the business of the company and the bank is directly affected by factors such as economic  political and market conditions  broad trends in industry and finance  legislative and regulatory changes  changes in government monetary and fiscal policies and inflation  all of which are beyond the company s control 
the bank is particularly affected by economic conditions in litchfield county  connecticut  berkshire county  massachusetts  and colombia and dutchess counties in new york 
deterioration in economic conditions could result in the following consequences  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows o problem assets and foreclosures may increase  o demand for the bank s products and services may decline  o low cost or non interest bearing deposits may decrease  and  o collateral for loans made by the bank  especially real estate  may decline in value  in turn reducing customers borrowing power  and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with the bank s existing loans 
in view of the geographic concentration of the bank s operations and the collateral securing the bank s loan portfolio  the company may be particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of any of these consequences  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company is dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect the company s prospects 
competition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of  and experience in  the banking industry within the communities the bank serves 
the company s and the bank s success depends to a significant degree upon the ability to attract and retain qualified management  loan origination  finance  administrative  marketing and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of management and personnel 
the loss of the services of the senior executive management team members or other key executives could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the bank s business is subject to interest rate risk 
a substantial portion of the company s income is derived from the differential or spread between the bank s interest earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets  and interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
because of the differences in the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
accordingly  fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect the interest rate spread and  in turn  the company s profitability 
in addition  loan origination volumes are affected by market interest rates 
rising interest rates  generally  are associated with a lower volume of loan originations while lower interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations 
conversely  in rising interest rate environments  loan repayment rates may decline and in falling interest rate environments  loan repayment rates may increase 
falling interest rate environments may cause additional refinancing of commercial real estate and family residence loans  which may depress the company s loan volumes or cause rates on loans to decline 
in addition  an increase in the general level of short term interest rates on variable rate loans may adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations or reduce the amount they wish to borrow 
as short term rates continue to rise  retention of existing deposit customers and the attraction of new deposit customers may require the company to increase rates it pays on deposit accounts 
changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect net interest spread  asset quality  loan origination volume  business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
certain types of loans have a higher degree of risk 
a downturn in the company s real estate markets could hurt the company s business because most of the bank s loans are secured by real estate 
real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by changes in national  regional or local economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers  changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes  regulations and policies and acts of nature 
if real estate prices decline  the value of real estate collateral securing the bank s loans could be reduced 
the bank s ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and the company would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans 
if there is a significant decline in real estate values  especially in the company s market area  the collateral for the bank s loans will provide less security 
any such downturn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the ability to attract deposits may effect bank s growth 
the company s ability to increase its assets depends in large part on the bank s ability to attract additional deposits at favorable rates 
the bank anticipates seeking additional deposits by offering deposit products that are competitive with those offered by other financial institutions in the company s markets and by establishing personal relationships with the bank s customers 
the bank s ability to attract additional deposits at competitive rates could have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in the business of banking  the allowance for loan and lease losses is an estimate and may not be adequate to cover all future actual losses 
a source of risk arises from the possibility that losses could be sustained because borrowers  guarantors  and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans and leases 
the underwriting and credit monitoring policies and procedures that the company has adopted to address this risk may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
unexpected losses may arise from a wide variety of specific or systemic factors  many of which are beyond the company s ability to predict  influence or control 
like all banking institutions  the bank maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses to provide for loan and lease defaults and non performance 
the allowance for loan and lease losses reflects the bank s estimate of the probable losses in the bank s loan and lease portfolio at the relevant balance sheet date 
the bank s allowance for loan and lease losses is based on prior experience  as well as an evaluation of the known risks in the current portfolio  composition and growth of the loan and lease portfolio and economic factors 
the determination of an appropriate level of loan and lease loss allowance is an inherently difficult process and is based on numerous assumptions 
the amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates  that may be beyond the bank s control and these losses may exceed current estimates 
federal and state regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  review the bank s loans and leases and allowance for loan and lease losses 
banks rely on communications  information  operating and financial control systems technology from third party service providers  and banks may suffer an interruption in those systems that may result in lost business and banks may not be able to obtain substitute providers on terms that are as favorable if bank s relationships with bank s existing service providers are interrupted 
the bank relies on certain third party service providers for much of the bank s communications  information  operating and financial control systems technology 
any failure or interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or interruptions in the bank s customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  servicing and or loan origination systems 
the bank cannot be certain that such failures or interruptions will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed by the bank or the third parties on which the bank relies 
the occurrence of any failures or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the bank s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if any of the bank s third party service providers experience financial  operational or technological difficulties  or if there is any other disruption in the bank s relationships with them  the bank may be required to locate alternative sources of such services  and the company cannot be certain that the bank could negotiate terms that are as favorable to the company  or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in the bank s existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources  if at all 
any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the bank faces strong competition from financial service companies and other companies that offer banking services 
increased competition in the bank s markets may result in reduced loans and deposits 
ultimately  the bank may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
many competitors offer the banking services that the bank offers in its service areas 
these competitors include national banks  regional banks and other community banks 
the bank also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions  including savings and loan associations  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  credit unions  mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries 
in particular  the bank s competitors include several major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns 
additionally  banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions may have larger lending limits  which would allow them to serve the credit needs of larger customers 
areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits  efforts to obtain loan and deposit customers and a range in quality of products and services provided  including new technology driven products and services 
technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets as technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services 
the bank also faces competition from out of state financial intermediaries that solicit deposits in the bank s market areas 
if the bank is unable to attract and retain banking customers  it may be unable to continue the bank s loan and deposit growth and the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 
the company and the bank are subject to extensive government regulation 
the operations of the company and the bank are subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of the operations of the company and the bank 
because the company s and the bank s business is highly regulated  the applicable laws  rules and regulations are subject to regular modification and change 
the company cannot be certain that laws  rules and regulations will not be adopted in the future  which could make compliance much more difficult or expensive  or otherwise adversely affect the company s and the bank s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company may be exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which the bank takes title 
in the course of the bank s business  the bank may foreclose and take title to real estate that could subject the company to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
customer information may be obtained and used fraudulently 
risk of theft of customer information resulting from security breaches by third parties exposes the company to reputation risk and potential monetary loss 
the company has exposure to fraudulent use of its customers personal information resulting from its general business operations and through customer use of financial instruments  such as debit cards 
if a breach in security does occur and the financial data of customers is compromised  the company will react as quickly as possible to protect customer accounts and limit potential losses to the company

per share dividend that was declared in critical accounting estimates in preparing the company s financial statements  management selects and applies numerous accounting policies 
in applying these policies  management must make estimates and assumptions 
the accounting policy that is most susceptible to critical estimates and assumptions is the allowance for loan losses 
the determination of an appropriate provision is based on a determination of the probable amount of credit losses in the loan portfolio 
many factors influence the amount of future loan losses  relating to both the specific characteristics of the loan portfolio and general economic conditions nationally and locally 
while management carefully considers these factors in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary due to changed conditions  which could have an adverse impact on reported earnings in the future

net interest and dividend income the company earns income from two basic sources 
the primary source is through the management of its financial assets and liabilities and involves functioning as a financial intermediary 
the company accepts funds from depositors and borrows funds and either lends the funds to borrowers or invests those funds in various types of securities 
the second source is fee income  which is discussed in the noninterest income section of this analysis 
net interest income is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans  interest and dividends earned on securities the company s earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds  primarily in the form of advances from the federal home loan bank 
the amount by which interest income will exceed interest expense depends on two factors the volume or balance of earning assets compared to the volume or balance of interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds and the interest rate earned on those interest earning assets compared with the interest rate paid on those interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds

as a result  loans outstanding at december  was  net of term federal funds sold compared to net loans outstanding of  at december  this is an increase of  or 
this growth can be attributed primarily to an increase in both residential and commercial real estate loan demand as well as the bank s new business development program 
approximately of the company s loan portfolio continues to be real estate secured 
credit risk is inherent in the business of extending loans 
the company monitors the loan portfolio to ensure that loan quality will not be sacrificed for growth or otherwise compromise the company s objectives 
because of the risk associated with extending loans the company maintains an allowance or reserve for loan and lease losses through charges to earnings 
the company evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a monthly basis 
such evaluations are based on assessments of credit quality and trends within the portfolio and risk rating of loans by senior management  which is reviewed by the company s loan committee on a regular basis 
loans are initially risk rated when originated 
if there is deterioration in the credit quality  the risk rating is adjusted accordingly 
the allowance for loan and lease losses alll at december  totaled  representing of nonperforming loans of  and of total loans outstanding net of term federal funds sold or  this compares to an alll of  which is of nonperforming loans of  and of total loans outstanding of  at december  management reduced the allowance by  that had previously been expensed through the loan loss provision from prior years 
this was justified by positive trends in the loan portfolio and low levels of delinquencies and net charge offs as well as low levels of classified and nonperforming loans 
a separate component that is evaluated is the allowance for off balance sheet commitments which totaled  as of december  the two allowances combined brought the total alll to  or of total loans outstanding 
the december  comparison included  in the allowance for off balance sheet commitments bringing the total combined alll to  or of total loans 
a total of  in loans were charged off during the year compared to  during recoveries of previously charged off loans totaled  during the year compared to  in recoveries for the allowance also includes a component resulting from the application of the measurement criteria of statements of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas 
impaired loans receive individual evaluation of the allowance necessary on a monthly basis 
loans to be considered for impairment are defined in the company s loan policy as commercial loans with balances outstanding of  or more and residential real estate mortgages with balances of  or more 
such loans are considered impaired when it is probable that the company will not be able to collect all principal and interest due according to the terms of the note 
any such commercial loan and or residential mortgage will be considered for impairment under any of the following circumstances non accrual status  loans over days delinquent  troubled debt restructures consummated after december   loans classified as doubtful  meaning that they have weaknesses  which make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
the individual allowance for any impaired loan is based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance 
in addition  a risk of loss factor is applied in evaluating categories of loans as part of the periodic analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
this analysis reviews the allocations of the different categories of loans within the portfolio and considers historical loan losses and delinquency balances as well as recent delinquent percentage trends 
the credit card delinquency and loss history is separately evaluated and given a special loan loss factor because management recognizes the higher risk involved in such loans 
concentrations of credit and local economic factors are also evaluated on a periodic basis 
historical averages of net losses by loan types are examined as well as trends by type 
the bank s loan mix over the same period of time is also analyzed 
a loan loss allocation is made for each type of loan multiplied by the loan mix percentage for each loan type to produce a weighted average factor 
while management estimates loan losses using the best available information  no assurances can be given that future additions to the allowance will not be necessary based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions  identification of additional problem loans or other factors 
additionally  despite the excellent overall quality of the loan portfolio and with expectations of the company to continue to grow its existing portfolio  future additions to the allowance may be necessary to maintain adequate reserve coverage 
overall  management is of the opinion that the alll is adequate as of december  deposits the company offers a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms 
deposits at year end totaled  compared to  at year end the company continues its efforts to competitively price products and develop and maintain relationship banking with its customers 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in money market rates  prevailing interest rates and the aggressive competition from nonbanking entities 
during the year  there was a change in the mix of deposits 
demand  now and savings balances which are lower cost core deposits  decreased  and were replaced primarily by time deposits which as illustrated by the table below  results in a significant increase in interest expense

these advances are made pursuant to various credit programs  each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
at december   the company had  in outstanding advances from the federal home loan bank compared to  at december  management expects that it will continue this strategy of supplementing deposit growth with advances from federal home loan bank of boston 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
interest rate risk is defined as an exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on net interest income 
net interest income is sensitive to interest rate risk to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than earning assets 
the bank s assets and liabilities are managed in accordance with policies established and reviewed by the bank s board of directors 
the bank s asset liability management committee monitors asset and deposit levels  developments and trends in interest rates  liquidity and capital 
one of the primary financial objectives is to manage interest rate risk and control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates in order to prudently improve net interest income and manage the maturities and interest rate sensitivities of assets and liabilities 
the bank uses asset liability modeling software to develop scenario analyses which measure the impact that changing interest rates have on net interest income 
these model simulations are projected out over a two year time horizon  assuming proportional upward and downward interest rate movements of  and basis points 
simulations are projected out in two ways using the same balance sheet as the bank had on the simulation date  and using a growing balance sheet based on recent growth patterns and strategies 
as interest rates rise or fall  these simulations incorporate expected future lending rates  current and expected future funding sources and cost  the possible exercise of options  changes in prepayment rates  and other factors which may be important in determining the future growth of net interest income 
the rates we earn on our assets and the rates we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time 
imbalance in these contractual maturities can create significant earnings volatility because market interest rates change over time 
in a period of rising interest rates  the interest income earned on assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on liabilities 
in a period of declining interest rates the interest income earned on assets may decrease more rapidly than the interest paid on liabilities 
this would primarily be attributed to accelerated prepayments on loans and securities that are significantly influenced by movements in market rates 
the net interest margin may be adversely affected by several possible interest rate environments 
foremost  a continued flat or inverted yield curve which results in shorter term market interest rates that equal or exceed those of longer term rates 
this could further increase the bank s cost of interest bearing liabilities that continue to outpace its yield on earning assets resulting in additional net interest rate spread compression 
liquidity liquidity is the ability to raise funds on a timely basis at an acceptable cost in order to meet cash needs 
adequate liquidity is necessary to handle fluctuation in deposit levels  to provide for customers credit needs  and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they are presented 
the company manages liquidity primarily with readily marketable investment securities  deposits and loan repayments 
the company s subsidiary  salisbury bank and trust company is a member of the federal home loan bank of boston that provides a source of available borrowings for liquidity 
at december   the company had approximately  in loan commitments outstanding 
management believes that the current level of liquidity is ample to meet the company s needs for both the present and foreseeable future 
capital at december   the company had  in shareholders equity compared to  at december  this represents an increase of  or 
several components contributed to the change since december earnings for the year totaled  securities in the portfolio that are classified as available for sale are adjusted to fair value monthly and the unrealized losses or gains are not included in earnings  but are reported as a net amount less expected tax as a separate component of capital until realized 
market fluctuations of fair value of the securities portfolio during resulted in other comprehensive income net of tax totaling  the initial application of sfas no 
 as defined below in recent accounting pronouncements  resulted in other comprehensive loss  net of tax of  in the company declared dividends in resulting in a decrease in capital of  the company issued new shares of common stock under the terms of the director stock retainer plan during the second quarter of which resulted in an increase in capital of  under current regulatory definitions  the company and the bank are considered to be well capitalized for capital adequacy purposes 
as a result  the bank pays the lowest federal deposit insurance deposit premiums possible 
one primary measure of capital adequacy for regulatory purposes is based on the ratio of risk based capital to risk weighted assets
