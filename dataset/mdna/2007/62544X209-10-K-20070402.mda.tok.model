however  the company is growing in its mdu segment while the mcs segment is shrinking due  in part  to sales of subscribers in that division during the company is continuing to analyze the values the equity capital marketplace is providing to its mcs directly owned subscribers in future periods  both to establish values for those subscribers and to provide additional liquidity 
between august  and march   the company has raised approximately million dollars in gross proceeds related to sales of subscriber related assets 
management of multiband believes that the cash on hand  combined with capital resources and the potential ability to monetize intangible subscriber assets  is adequate to meet the anticipated liquidity and capital resource requirements for the next months

although the majority of the loss was due to non cash expenses  the company in still continued to incur cash losses as well due to general corporate expense 
however  those cash operating losses decreased significantly in versus due to the increase in non cash depreciation  amortization  and amortization of original issue discount as well as by the on going additions of mcs properties in the company s portfolio which provided improved cash flows 
in february  the company sold ten million dollars worth of class i convertible preferred stock 
proceeds from this financing were used to secure ownership of previous acquisitions  perform new acquisitions and build out additional services to mdu properties 
all these activities improved the company s operating performance 
continued improvement of company operating performance and execution of our business strategy will require additional funding in the company s operating performance indicates that performance on a mdu property level improves when the company offers two or three services at a property versus a single service 
although the company believes it is possible to obtain additional financing to build infrastructure and add services in by leveraging its asset base  there is no assurance this financing will be obtained 
thus  the lack of additional funding combined with continued operating losses in may restrict our ability to continue to improve our operating performance by adding services at mdu properties 
however as of december   even without additional funding  based on current operating results  management believes existing cash and capital resources are adequate to meet anticipated liquidity requirements during critical accounting policies impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets include property  equipment and leasehold improvement

in and  the company did not record any impairment 
in  an impairment charge of  was recorded due to the sale of video assets located in california see note 
impairment of goodwill we periodically evaluate acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses  which amounts to  as of december   may be impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in  the company recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of  see note  due to the sale of video assets located in california see note

impairment of intangible assets the intangible assets consist of rights of entry contracts  customer cable lists  debt issuance costs  domain name and access contracts 
these intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from to months 
if significant changes would occur to the estimated future cash flow associated with these intangibles  the company would determine if there is impairment and reduce the value of the intangibles based on the reduction of such cash flows

page inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost or the current estimated market value of the inventory

retains the exchange price notion in earlier definitions of fair value  but clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
moreover  the sfas states that the transaction is hypothetical at the measurement date  considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the asset or liability 
consequently  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price  as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability at the measurement date an entry price 
sfas no 
also stipulates that  as a market based measurement  fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  and establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between a market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and b the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs
