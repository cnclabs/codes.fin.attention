fiscal and results include weeks 
overview the company is a regional department and specialty store chain completing its nd year of operation 
as of february   the company operated full line gottschalks department stores located in six western states  with the majority of those stores located in california 
the company also operates village east and gottschalks specialty store which carry a limited selection of merchandise 
the company s department stores typically offer a wide range of better to moderate brand name and private label merchandise  including mens  womens  juniors and childrens apparel  cosmetics  shoes  fine jewelry and accessories  and home furnishings including china  housewares  domestics  small electric appliances and  in selected locations  furniture and mattresses 
in the fourth quarter   the company announced that its board of directors formed a special strategic committee to identify and evaluate various strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value  including  a revised business plan  operating partnerships  joint ventures  strategic alliances  share repurchases  a recapitalization  and the sale or merger of the company 
the special strategic committee is comprised of the board s six independent directors for the alternative review process 
the company also announced that the board of directors has retained ubs investment bank to assist its special strategic committee in exploring various alternatives available to the company 
the company will also continue to use the financial advisory services of financo  inc the company has not set a definitive timetable for completion of its review of strategic alternatives and further advises that there can be no assurances that the evaluation process will result in any transaction 
the company does not intend to disclose developments regarding its evaluation of strategic alternatives unless and until the board of directors has approved a specific transaction 
the retail industry is highly competitive 
the company experiences competitive pressures from department stores  specialty stores  mass merchandisers and other retail channels  and from general consumer spending levels  including the impact of employment levels and other economic conditions 
despite these challenges  the company achieved a moderate comparable store sales growth of  excluding the effect of rd week sales  during fiscal and during fiscal during fiscal the company closed stores  of which were underperforming  and opened store in eugene  oregon 
the store gross margin dollars lost by these closures were somewhat offset by incremental gross margin dollars generated from a successful new store opening 
rising costs  including incremental opening and operating costs of the new store  and increases in fuel and energy costs during the year  affecting utilities  supplies  and transportation costs were somewhat offset by the successful new store performance 
during fiscal the company became subject to a class action complaint alleging violation of california law regarding payment of accrued vacation upon termination of employment 
the company believed settlement of this matter was in its best interests and entered into a memorandum of understanding for class settlement  which received final court approval in september accordingly  the company accrued million in the fourth quarter of fiscal and  in the fourth quarter of fiscal for estimated legal fees and settlement costs and disbursed all funds in december management does not believe the ultimate resolution will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company s liquidity position remains strong and on january  the company finalized an amendment to its revolving credit facility increasing the commitment to million  reducing the interest rate charged on outstanding borrowing by basis points  and allowing for the payoff of approximately million of outstanding balances on higher interest rate mortgages related to four of the company s owned properties which payoff occurred subsequent to the end of fiscal in addition  the amendment provides for an optional additional increase in the commitment of million and an optional extension of the credit facility through february  in addition  on december   in an effort to mitigate increasing interest rates  the company effectively fixed the interest on million of its variable rate debt through the execution of an interest rate swap 
as a result of its stable performance and continued improvement in debt structure  the company plans to increase its efforts to refresh the presentation of its core store base as well as continue to explore opportunities for controlled new store growth 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements included in part iv  item of this form k 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to its revenue recognition policy  the carrying value of its merchandise inventories  the adequacy of its workers compensation insurance reserves  and the valuation of its long lived assets  including goodwill  and its deferred tax assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from the company s estimates 
some of the company s significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity than its other accounting policies 
the policies described below have been identified as critical to the company s business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and associated risks related to these policies on the company s business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition policy net retail sales are recognized at the point of sale  net of estimated sales returns and allowances and exclusive of sales tax 
net retail sales also include all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction for shipping and handling  including customer delivery charges 
revenues on special order sales are recognized when the merchandise is delivered to the customer and the merchandise has been paid for in its entirety 
the company records an allowance for estimated sales returns in the period that the related sale occurs 
these estimates are based primarily on historical sales returns 
if the historical data used to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  adjustments to the allowance for estimated sales returns may be necessary 
inventory valuation merchandise inventory  which consists of merchandise held for resale  is valued at the lower of lifo last in  first out cost or market using the retail inventory method rim of accounting 
inherent in the rim calculation are various judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as resulting gross margins 
the company applies various methodologies to ensure that the application of the rim is consistent for all periods presented 
such methodologies include the development of consistent cost to retail ratios and the grouping of homogenous classes of merchandise 
estimated inventory shrinkage between physical inventory dates is based on historical experience 
should actual inventory shrinkage results differ from the company s estimate  year end revisions to inventory shrinkage expense recognized on an interim basis may be required 
estimating the market value of the company s merchandise inventory requires assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
such estimates are based on actual and forecasted sales trends  current inventory levels and aging information by merchandise categories 
the company records markdowns to value merchandise inventories at net realizable value 
if forecasted sales are not achieved  or if other indicators of impairment are present  additional markdowns may be needed in future periods to clear excess or slow moving merchandise  which may result in lower gross margins 
impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment  goodwill  leasehold interests and other long term assets 
long lived assets including intangible assets other than goodwill  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company performs an evaluation of whether an impairment charge should be recorded whenever a store experiences unfavorable operating performance 
a store s assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing its estimated undiscounted cash flows over its estimated remaining lease term to its carrying value 
if the cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset is recognized 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a variety of factors  including historical experience in similar locations  changes in merchandising  promotional or operating strategy that may affect the profitability of a particular location  knowledge of the market area and in some cases  expected sale proceeds or sublease income  and independent appraisals 
goodwill and intangible assets having indefinite lives are not being amortized to earnings  but instead are subject to periodic testing for impairment 
goodwill and other intangible assets of a reporting unit are tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently if certain indicators are encountered 
various uncertainties  including but not limited to changes in consumer preferences  increased competition or a general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely impact the expected cash flows to be generated by an asset or group of assets 
if actual performance or fair value estimates for store locations are less favorable than management s projections  future asset impairment charges may be necessary 
similar procedures are used when analyzing other corporate assets for impairment 
income taxes the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the value of these assets 
in determining the appropriate valuation allowance  management considers all available evidence for the deferred tax assets  including tax credits  net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards that would likely expire prior to their utilization 
the company has established valuation allowances that relate primarily to certain state tax credit carryforwards whose reliability is uncertain 
although these credits do not expire  the utilization is extremely limited and is available only to the extent the company generates sufficient taxable income apportionable to the respective location 
the company has historically generated the credits at a substantially more rapid rate than it has been able to utilize them 
the resulting utilization period is  therefore  unusually long 
although the company has had recent profitability  there can be no certainty that the company will continue to generate sufficient taxable income apportioned to specific locations for an indefinite period of time to fully utilize the state tax credit carryforwards  especially given the cyclical nature of the company s business 
further  there is no certainty that the company will operate in these specific locations for an extended period 
to the extent that the company no longer operates within these locations  the tax credits cannot be utilized 
the company considers it appropriate to release this valuation allowance after at least three years of continued operating profits  limited to the projected utilization of the state tax credits based on assumed operation in the specific locations of not more than ten years 
in addition  the company has generated certain capital losses for which there is currently no carryback opportunity available 
based on the company s current operating strategy it appears more likely than not that there will be no opportunity available during the remaining carryforward period to generate offsetting capital gains 
accordingly the company considers it appropriate to establish a valuation allowance against such carryforwards 
management believes it is more likely than not that the company will generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate carryforward periods to realize the benefit of its remaining net deferred tax assets 
however  if the available evidence were to change in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance may be required  resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit

cash generated by operations  together with liquidity provided by the credit facility  and other financial resources are expected to adequately finance the company s planned cash requirements for fiscal new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to fas and creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin requires that tax positions accounted for under fas be evaluated for recognition based solely on technical merits and the resulting tax benefits be measured using a cumulative probability assessment and the company s plan for settlement 
the recognition classification and cumulative effect of the fin liability may be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings 
the company is required to adopt fin beginning in fiscal year the company does not expect that the adoption of fin will have a significant impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurement and the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  of sfas on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
sfas requires prospective application for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to reduce fluctuation in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
most of the provisions of sfas apply only to entities that elect the fair value option 
however  the amendment to fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities 
sfas is effective for the company on february  the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  of sfas on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
inflation although inflation has not been a material factor in the company s operations during the past several years  the company has experienced increases in the costs of certain merchandise  salaries  employee benefits and other general and administrative costs  including utilities  supplies  and transportation costs 
the company is generally able to offset these increases by adjusting its selling prices or by modifying its operations 
the company s ability to adjust selling prices is limited by competitive pressures in its market areas 
the company values its merchandise inventories at the lower of lifo cost or market using the retail inventory method of accounting 
under the lifo method  which is determined by using the department store price indices published by the bureau of labor statistics  the cost of products sold reported in the financial statements approximates current costs and thus reduces the impact of inflation due to increasing costs on reported income 
the valuation of the company s merchandise inventories under the lifo method is currently equal to that as determined by the first in  first out fifo method of accounting 
seasonality the company s business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal influences  with the major portion of net sales  gross profit and operating income realized during the christmas selling months of november and december of each year  and  to a lesser extent  during the easter and back to school selling seasons 
the company s results may also vary from quarter to quarter as a result of  among other things  the timing and level of the company s sales promotions  weather  fashion trends and the overall health of the economy  both nationally and in the company s market areas 
working capital requirements also fluctuate during the year  increasing substantially prior to the christmas selling season when the company must carry significantly higher inventory levels 
the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly results of operations for fiscal and in thousands  except per share data

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks in the normal course of business due to changes in interest rates on borrowings under its senior revolving credit facility 
to provide some protection against potential rate increases associated with its variable rate facilities  the company entered into a derivative financial transaction in the form of an interest rate swap 
the interest rate swap is used to hedge a portion of the underlying variable rate facility 
the company currently holds a variable to fixed rate swap with a notional amount of million with one financial institution 
the notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties  rather  it is used as the basis to calculate amounts due and to be received under the rate swap 
although the swap essentially provides for matched terms to its underlying  and effectively mitigates its variability  it currently does not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
accordingly  changes in fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in interest expense 
during fiscal and  the company did not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes  nor does it engage in financial transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
all contracts and purchase obligations are denominated in us dollars and accordingly the company is not subject to foreign exchange rate risk 
as of february   borrowings subject to variable interest rates represented of the company s total outstanding borrowings 
the interest payable on the company s senior revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
an increase of basis points on existing floating rate borrowings a change from the company s weighted average interest rate as of february  would reduce the company s pre tax net income and cash flow by approximately million 
this basis point increase in interest rates would not materially effect the fair value of the company s fixed rate financial instruments 
see note to the accompanying financial statements
