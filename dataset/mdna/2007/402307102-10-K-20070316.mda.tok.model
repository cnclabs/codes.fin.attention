item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction and outlook our results of operations are affected primarily by i the level of exploration and development activity maintained by oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in the gulf of mexico  and to a lesser extent  foreign locations throughout the world  ii our ability to win contracts through competitive bidding or alliance partnering arrangements  and iii our ability to manage those contracts to successful completion 
the level of exploration and development activity is related to several factors  including trends of oil and natural gas prices  exploration and production companies expectations of future oil and natural gas prices  and changes in technology that reduce costs and improve expected returns on investment 
during the year end close process  we discovered an error regarding the estimated revenue on the tahiti contract  which we assumed when we acquired gulf marine fabricators  effective january  we determined that the amount of revenue we recognized on this contract during the first three quarters of was overstated 
we included in note quarterly operating results unaudited  previously reported and restated quarterly financial results for the quarters ended march   june  and september  and will not amend its previous filings 
gulf marine fabricators effective january   we acquired the facilities  machinery and equipment of gulf marine located in san patricio county  texas as further described in note to the financial statements in item and in the forms k and k a filed on february and april   respectively 
included in our operating results are the operating results for gulf marine for february through december of the twelve month period ended december  those results are in thousands twelve months ended december  revenue cost of revenue general and administrative expense backlog as of december   we had a revenue backlog of million and a labor backlog of approximately million man hours remaining to work  which consists of work remaining at december  and commitments received through february   compared to the revenue backlog of million and a labor backlog of million man hours reported in our form k at december

index to financial statements of the backlog at december   million  or  represented projects destined for deepwater locations compared to million  or  of projects destined for deepwater locations included in the december  backlog 
the acquisition of gulf marine enabled us to more fully participate in the market for deepwater projects  which we believe will continue to expand as a proportion of total offshore projects 
these deepwater projects directly contributed to the much larger backlog at december  of the backlog at december   we expect to recognize revenues of approximately million during calendar year and million during calendar year during  our workforce ranged from approximately  to  employees 
demand for our products and services dictate our workforce needs 
although we generally try to minimize the use of contract labor  we will use contract labor when required to meet customer demand 
for  our use of contract labor ranged from approximately to critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis based on the ratio of direct labor hours actually performed to date compared to the total estimated direct labor hours required for completion 
accordingly  contract price and cost estimates are reviewed monthly as the work progresses  and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in revenue for the period when such estimates are revised 
if these adjustments were to result in a reduction of previously reported profits  we would have to recognize a charge against current earnings  which may be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
profit incentives from customers are included in revenue when their realization is reasonably assured 
claims for extra work or changes in scope of work are included in revenue when the amount can be reliably estimated and collection is probable 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses are determined 
some contracts include a total or partial reimbursement to us of any costs associated with specific capital projects required by the fabrication process 
if this capital project provides future benefits to us  the cost to build the capital project will be capitalized  and the revenue for the capital project will increase the estimated profit in the contract 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and our revenue for the twelve month period ended december  was million  an increase of  compared to million in revenue for the twelve month period ended december  the majority of the increase in revenue was associated with the acquisition of gulf marine  which enabled us to more fully participate in the market for deepwater projects

gulf coast imparting extensive damage to the offshore platforms and the infrastructure along the gulf coast 
this damage negatively impacted the gulf coast fabrication industry  including us  for the third and fourth quarters of the pressure placed on the existing skilled labor by the rebuilding of the gulf coast after hurricanes katrina and rita  the upgrading of the petro chemical plants in the area  and the high demand for skilled labor throughout the marine construction industry caused us to incur increased labor costs and to rely more heavily on contract labor  not only during  but throughout the increased employee and contract labor costs  particularly on two large contracts in our backlog that were bid before hurricanes katrina and rita  was the major cause of the reduction in gross profit margin to of revenue for  from of revenue for we also experienced an increase in raw material costs

exclusive of gulf marine  general and administrative expenses were million  of revenue  for the twelve month period ended december  exclusive of gulf marine  the absolute dollar increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increases in salaries and wage related cost associated with the increase in production activities 
we had net interest expense of  for the twelve month period ended december   compared to net interest income of million for the twelve month period ended december  the change is primarily the result of borrowings incurred by us related to the acquisition of  and additional capital expenditures for  gulf marine  during in the other section  of the other income expense category  for  is a net income of million 
the majority of this income was the result of the sale of our interest in mindoc  which was effective january   and which generated a gain of approximately million 
the remainder was from the gain on the sale of other fixed assets

fasb required that we record the loss in our effective income tax rate was for the twelve month period ended december   compared to of income before income taxes for the twelve month period ended december  the decrease relates primarily to the change in the apportionment of taxable state income and employment hiring credits for both state and federal taxes 
comparison of the years ended december  and we experienced an increase in revenue  increase in gross profit  and an increase in net income for the first six months of compared to the first six months of this up cycle was soon slowed by the direct and residual effects of the worst hurricane season in recorded history 
the direct effects of hurricanes katrina and rita happened during the third quarter of the year when our facilities had to be shut down for an aggregate of approximately weeks in production days
