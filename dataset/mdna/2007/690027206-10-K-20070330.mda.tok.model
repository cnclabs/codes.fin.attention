general through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary  the outdoor channel  inc or toc  we own and operate the outdoor channel which is a national television network devoted primarily to traditional outdoor activities  such as hunting  fishing and shooting sports  as well as off road motor sports and other outdoor related lifestyle programming 
we also own and operate related businesses which serve the interests of the outdoor channel s viewers and other outdoor enthusiasts 
these related businesses include ldma au  inc  which we refer to as lost dutchman s  and gold prospector s association of america  llc  which we refer to as gpaa 
lost dutchman s is a national gold prospecting campground club with properties in arizona  california  colorado  georgia  michigan  north carolina  oregon and south carolina 
among other services offered  gpaa is the publisher of the gold prospector treasure hunters in the great outdoors magazine 
in addition  we are the owner of a  acre property near nome  alaska used to provide outings for a fee to the members of lost dutchman s and gpaa 
outdoor channel holdings also wholly owns bpd  llc that owns the building housing our broadcast facility 
our revenues include advertising fees from advertisements aired on the outdoor channel and from advertisements in gold prospector treasure hunters in the great outdoors magazine  subscriber fees paid by cable and satellite service providers that air the outdoor channel  and membership fees from members in both lost dutchman s and gpaa and other income including magazine sales  products and services related to gold prospecting  gold expositions  expeditions and outings 
advertising fees include fees paid by third party programmers to purchase advertising time in connection with the airing of their programs on the outdoor channel 
reclassifications certain amounts in the and consolidated financial statements have been reclassified from amounts in the consolidated financial statements we originally filed before the restatements described in note of our financial statements either to conform to the presentations or to provide additional detail about our operating results and more fully comply with the securities and exchange commission s sec regulation s x 
in particular certain amounts included under expenses in the and consolidated financial statements we originally issued have been reclassified in line items under either cost of services or other expenses 
cost of services includes programming  satellite transmission fees  production and operations and other direct costs 
other expenses include advertising  selling  general and administrative and depreciation and amortization 
further to better match intangible assets with the segment to which they pertain  we have reclassified the amortizable intangible assets and the goodwill which were recorded in connection with the acquisition on september  of the remaining minority interest in toc along with the related amortization expense from corporate to the toc segment 
certain other changes have been made in the historical consolidated financial statements to conform with current presentations 
acquisition of the minority interest of the outdoor channel  inc on september   we completed the acquisition of the remaining minority interest in toc which we did not previously own through i the merger of toc with our newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary  with toc being the surviving corporation  and ii the exchange of each share of toc common stock not previously held by us or our subsidiaries for shares of our common stock 
in addition  each outstanding option to purchase one share of toc common stock was exchanged for an option to purchase shares of our common stock 
in september  every two outstanding shares of our common stock were converted into five outstanding shares of common stock in conjunction with our reincorporation from alaska to delaware the for split 
based on the exchange ratio in the merger we issued  shares of our common stock as well as options to purchase  additional shares  each as adjusted for the for split 
the shares issued include the shares of common stock issued to a former toc shareholder who originally exercised his dissenters rights in connection with the transaction  but who later withdrew  with our consent  the demand to exercise such dissenter s rights 
for accounting purposes  all previously outstanding toc common shares  including the dissenting shares  have been deemed to have been exchanged for shares of our common stock in september the acquisition of the minority interest in toc was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the cost of acquiring the minority interest included the aggregate fair value of our common shares issued in exchange for common shares of toc and certain other direct costs 
the acquisition cost was allocated based on the fair value of the assets of toc that were acquired and liabilities that were assumed  including intangible assets that arose from contractual or other legal rights or met certain other recognition criteria that underlie the minority interest that was acquired 
the excess of the cost of the minority interest over the fair value of the underlying interest in the net identifiable assets acquired was allocated to goodwill 
in addition  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas the tax effects of the intangible assets have been treated as additional consideration 
this additional consideration has also been allocated to goodwill 
the cost of our acquisition of the minority interest in toc was  based on the issuance at the closing of  shares of our common stock including shares issued to the former dissenter and the average closing price of per share of our common stock for a specified period before and after april   the last trading day before the public announcement of the material terms of the acquisition plus the assumption of  fully vested options of a former employee of toc with an intrinsic value of  plus certain other costs including income tax effects 
based on the analysis of the fair value of the assets that were acquired and liabilities that were assumed  the acquisition costs of  were allocated primarily to intangible assets as follows allocation estimated useful life in thousands mso relationships years  months advertising customer relationships short form years long form years total identifiable intangible assets goodwill indefinite deferred tax liability associated with intangible assets minority interest in subsidiary aggregate purchase price the exchange of vested employee stock options by us for vested stock options held by employees of toc resulted in a charge to operations in our consolidated statement of operations on september  equal to the value of the options issued on that date net of any related income tax benefit 
the options to purchase approximately  shares that we issued in exchange for vested stock options held by the employees of toc on september  had a fair value of per share based on the closing price of our common stock on that day 
as a result  we incurred a non cash  non recurring charge to operating expenses of  and recognized an income tax benefit of  or a net charge of  in some of the following period to period comparisons  we have specifically noted  and at times excluded the non cash  non recurring compensation expense of  incurred by us and the related tax benefit of  as the result of the assumption of toc options in connection with our acquisition of the minority interest in toc as part of our analysis because we believe separately quantifying the effects of these items provides the reader with a better understanding of our operating results 
we also believe that an analysis of our results in this manner  when presented in conjunction with our analysis of the corresponding gaap measures  provides useful information to management and others in identifying and understanding our operating performance for the periods presented and in making useful comparisons 
reassessment of useful life of mso relationships during the three months ended september   we reviewed the facts and circumstances regarding the useful life of our intangible assets attributable to multi system cable operator mso relationships as of september  when we completed the acquisition of the minority interest in toc that we did not previously own and allocated a portion of the excess of the cost of the minority interest over the fair value of the underlying interest in the net identifiable assets acquired to the mso relationships 
after consideration of the facts and circumstances  the nature of our business  our experience with the msos of our network  and the proclivities of our industry  we have concluded that as of september  our mso relationships asset had a definite life which we have estimated to be years and months and  accordingly  we reclassified all of the amounts originally allocated to the cost of mso relationships from other non amortizable intangible assets to amortizable intangible assets as of that date 
the accounting treatment resulting from this reassessment of the useful life of this asset has resulted in adjustments to amortization expense and certain other related adjustments to our previously issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods ended september  through june  we determined that the effects of these adjustments were immaterial individually and in the aggregate to our annual and quarterly reports filed prior to january  and thus we did not amend those filings 
however  we determined the effects of these adjustments were material to our quarterly and annual reports filed for the periods ended march  through june  and we have amended all of those filings 
the comparative consolidated financial statements in this report reflect the restated balances 
considerations of impairment of intangible assets during the three months ended september   we engaged third party consultants to review our business practices and strategy 
among the areas reviewed was our approach to growing our subscriber base through our relationships with msos 
in september  the consultants concluded  and the board of directors accepted their conclusions  that a complete revision of the terms of our relationships with msos was necessary to meet the subscriber growth goals established by us 
upon acceptance of that conclusion and the general strategy outlined by the consultants  we reviewed our amortizable mso relationships and our other amortizable intangible assets customer lists and trademarks for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
based upon the changed circumstances  we concluded that  as of the date we accepted the consultants conclusion  our mso relationships asset was fully impaired and that our other remaining amortizable intangible assets were not 
accordingly  we have charged to expense the remaining unamortized carrying value of the mso relationships of  during the year ended december  we further concluded that the carrying value of goodwill has not been impaired and that the changed circumstances have not affected the estimated lives of the remaining amortizable intangible assets 
however  these estimates will continue to be reviewed during each reporting period to determine whether circumstances continue to support their carrying values and  where applicable  their estimated useful lives 
estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in the determination of the fair value 
a significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit or the undiscounted cash flows from the other remaining amortizable intangible assets could result in an impairment of goodwill or the remaining amortizable intangibles and a non cash charge would be required 
such a charge could have a significant effect on our reported net earnings 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of financial statements 
revenue recognition advertising revenues for the outdoor channel are recognized when the advertisement is aired 
advertising revenues from advertisements in our bi monthly magazine are recognized when the magazine is distributed 
revenues from the expeditions are recognized when they are taken in june through august each year 
revenues from outings and gold expositions are recognized at the time of the event 
subscriber fees for the outdoor channel are recognized in the period the programming is aired by the distributor and collection is probable 
broadcast and national television network advertising contracts may guarantee the advertiser a minimum audience for its advertisements over the term of the contracts 
we provide the advertiser with additional advertising time if we do not deliver the guaranteed audience size 
the amount of additional advertising time is generally based upon the percentage of shortfall in audience size 
this requires us to make estimates of the audience size that will be delivered throughout the terms of the contracts 
we base our estimate of audience size on information provided by ratings services and our historical experience 
if we determine we will not deliver the guaranteed audience  an accrual for make good advertisements is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
the estimated make good accrual is adjusted throughout the terms of the advertising contracts 
we recognize merchandise sales when the product is shipped and collection of the receivable is probable 
lost dutchman s campground membership sales are generally recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated average life years of the membership 
we do not record receivables arising under these contracts 
accordingly  revenues recognized do not exceed the total cash payments received and cash received in excess of revenue earned is recorded as deferred revenue 
the majority of gpaa membership sales is for one year and is generally recognized in the year of sale 
multi year gpaa membership sales are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of a membership  and an estimated life of years for a lifetime membership 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment  mso relationships  advertising customer relationships  goodwill and trademarks  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment losses are recognized when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by such assets are less than their carrying value and  accordingly  all or a portion of such carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment losses for assets to be held and used are then measured based on the excess  if any  of the carrying amounts of the assets over their estimated fair values 
long lived assets to be disposed of in a manner that meets specific criteria are stated at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may arise if any of our customers are unable to make required payments 
management specifically analyzes the age of customer balances  historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness and trade publications regarding the financial health of our larger customers and changes in customer payment terms when making estimates of the uncollectability of our trade accounts receivable balances 
if we determine that the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorated  whether due to customer specific or general economic issues  increases in the allowance may be made 
deferred tax assets and income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method which requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be computed for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
the income tax provision is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
with our adoption of sfas r on january  we present  on a prospective basis  the tax benefits from exercise of stock options in excess of recognized expense as a cash flow from financing activities in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows rather than as a cash flow from operating activities  as was prescribed under accounting rules applicable through december  this requirement reduces the amount reflected as net cash provided by operating activities and increases net cash provided by financing activities 
total cash flows remained unchanged from that which would have been reported under prior accounting rules 
we recognize such benefits only if they have been realized which we determine by following the tax law method  which provides that current deductions are recognized before realizing the benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards 
recent accounting developments in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r share based payment which revised the standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires that the fair value of such equity instruments  including all options granted to employees  be recognized as expense in the historical financial statements as services are performed 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we used the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock options and  generally  made no charges against earnings with respect to those options at the date of grant since our employee options had exercise prices that were equal to the market price 
sfas r is effective for issuers as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after december  accordingly  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r effective january  in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
currently  the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes is subject to significant and varied interpretations that have resulted in diverse and inconsistent accounting practices and measurements 
addressing such diversity  fin prescribes a consistent recognition threshold and measurement attribute  as well as clear criteria for subsequently recognizing  derecognizing and measuring changes in such tax positions for financial statement purposes 
fin also requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have not yet determined the impact of fin on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or financial statement disclosures 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november  the adoption of sab did not have any impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas no

sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we have not determined the impact  if any  the adoption of this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
the fasb had issued certain other accounting pronouncements as of december  that will become effective in subsequent periods  however  our management does not believe that any of those pronouncements would have significantly affected our financial accounting measurements or disclosures had they been in effect during  or comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  the following table discloses certain financial information for the periods presented  expressed in terms of dollars  dollar change  percentage change and as a percent of total revenue all dollar amounts are in thousands change of total revenue revenues advertising subscriber fees membership income total revenues cost of services programming satellite transmission fees production and operations other direct costs total cost of services other expenses advertising selling  general and administrative impairment of amortizable intangible assets nmf depreciation andamortization total other expenses income loss from operations interest expense other income income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss nmf not meaningful revenues our revenues include revenues from advertising fees  subscriber fees  and membership income 
advertising revenue is generated from the sale of advertising time on the outdoor channel including advertisements shown during a program also known as short form advertising and infomercials in which the advertisement is the program itself also known as long form advertising and from the sale of advertising space in publications such as the gold prospectors treasure hunters in the great outdoors magazine 
advertising revenue is also generated from fees paid by third party programmers that purchase advertising time in connection with the airing of their programs on the outdoor channel 
in each of the years ended december  and  the outdoor channel generated approximately of our advertising revenue 
subscriber fees are solely related to the outdoor channel 
membership income is generated by our activities other than the operation of the outdoor channel and includes membership sales  magazine sales  merchandise sales  and sponsored outings and expeditions in connection with gpaa and lost dutchman s 
total revenues for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to revenues of  for the year ended december  the net increases were the result of changes in several items comprising revenue as discussed below 
advertising revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  for december  nielsen estimated that the outdoor channel had million subscribers compared to million for the same period a year ago 
the increase in advertising revenue for the year ended december  principally reflects higher prices paid by third party programmers for advertising time in connection with the airing of their programs  incremental advertising inventory retained by us to sell and additional revenue generated by our technical services department for providing production services for third party programmers 
these factors contributing to the increase were offset somewhat by less demand for our long form inventory that resulted in lower prices paid for infomercial blocks 
we expect softness in the long form market to continue for the short term future 
we expect to provide less technical services to third parties in than in nielsen revises its estimate of the number of subscribers to our channel each month  and for march nielsen increased its estimate to almost million subscribers 
nielsen is the leading provider of television audience measurement and advertising information services worldwide  and its estimates and methodology are generally accepted and used in the advertising industry 
although we realize nielsen s estimate is typically greater than the number of subscribers on which a network is paid by the service providers  we are currently experiencing a greater difference in these two different numbers of subscribers than we would expect 
we anticipate this difference to decrease as we grow our total subscriber base 
there can be no assurances that nielsen will continue to report growth of its estimate of our subscribers and in fact at some point nielsen might even report declines in our subscriber estimate 
if that were to happen  we could suffer a reduction in advertising revenue 
subscriber fees for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in subscriber fees for the period was primarily due to an increased number of paying subscribers both from new affiliates and from existing distributors as well as contractual subscriber fee rate increases with existing service providers carrying the outdoor channel 
we plan to accelerate our subscriber growth utilizing various means including deployment of rate relief for new and existing subscribers and payment of subscriber acquisition or launch support fees among other tactics 
such launch support fees are capitalized and amortized over the period that the pay television distributor is required to carry the newly acquired toc subscriber 
to the extent revenue is associated with the incremental subscribers  the amortization is charged to offset the related revenue 
any excess of launch support amortization over the related subscriber fee revenue is charged to expense 
as a result of a combination of these tactics  we anticipate subscriber fee revenue  net will decrease over the short term future as we deploy this strategy 
membership income for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  we believe that the recent surge in gold prices has reflected itself in renewed interest by the consuming public that led to our increased activity in in the near term  we do not expect significant fluctuations in membership income year to year 
cost of services our cost of services consists primarily of the cost of providing our broadcast signal and programming to the distributors for transmission to the consumer and costs associated with the production and delivery of our magazine and merchandise sales 
cost of services includes programming costs  satellite transmission fees  production and operations costs  and other direct costs 
total cost of services for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  total cost of services was and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of services  as further discussed below  relates principally to increased programming costs related to producing shows to air on our second network  which we did not have in the first half of we expect cost of services to continue to increase in the future as we expand our existing markets and in house production to support our advertising strategy 
programming expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for year ended december  the increase is principally a result of our decision to launch our second channel  outdoor channel hd  on july  we incurred minimal programming costs relative to this channel in the first and second quarters of as most of such costs incurred at that time were charged to prepaid programming costs in anticipation of its launch in the second half of our policy is to charge costs of specific show production to programming expense over the expected airing period beginning when the program first airs 
the cost of programming is generally first recorded as prepaid programming costs and is then charged to programming expense based on the anticipated airing schedule 
the anticipated airing schedule has typically been over or quarters that generally does not extend over more than years 
as the anticipated airing schedule changes  the timing and amount of the charge to expense is prospectively adjusted accordingly 
at the time we determine a program is unlikely to air or re air  we charge programming expense with the remaining associated cost recorded in prepaid programming 
we reassessed our programming direction during the fourth quarter of and charged to expense over  of prepaid programming costs that had otherwise been planned to air and then be expensed in the future 
programming expenses are expected to stabilize as a percentage of revenue over the near term 
further  we are considering a new programming strategy which will include more airings per show including a greater number of repeat episodes within the quarter and potentially more quarters extending over more years 
as this plan is developed we will reconsider the appropriate timing of the charge to expense of our programming costs 
satellite transmission fees for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  we do not expect significant fluctuations in satellite transmission fees other than marginal increases reflecting contractual price increases over the foreseeable future 
production and operations costs for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in costs principally relates to increased personnel to support our growing infrastructure as we produce more shows in house and to support our new broadcast facility 
other direct costs for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease is principally related to less printed material being sent to the members of our membership division including one less magazine in than in  and other related materials 
other expenses other expenses consist of the cost of advertising  selling  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization 
in addition for the year ended december   other expenses include impairment of intangible assets 
for the year ended december   other expenses included non cash compensation expense from exchange of stock options 
total other expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  total other expenses were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in other expenses was due to several factors including the write off of  of the carrying value of mso relationships as a result of a changed distribution strategy adopted by the board in september  adoption of sfas r effective january  resulting in additional compensation expense of  in addition  from the recognized expense related to performance units granted to our new ceo in the fourth quarter of  additional depreciation expense resulting from our broadcast facility which was placed into service effective april   and other items more fully described as follows 
advertising expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  we had planned increased advertising expenditures but delayed such in anticipation of launching a cross channel television advertising campaign  which began in late september of we believe that our advertising expenses will substantially increase over the short term future as we continue to deploy tactics to increase our subscriber base and the number of viewers watching our programming 
we are reassessing our branding strategy and have decided to adopt a new logo 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily attributable to the adoption of sfas r as of january   which now requires us to charge the fair value of stock options we have issued to our employees over the vesting period to compensation expense that we did not have to record in the non cash charge in the year ended december  amounted to  additionally  we granted our new ceo two traunches of performance units of  shares each which vest in  share increments based upon our stock price reaching stipulated levels 
we have calculated their fair value using a lattice model 
the first traunch has an estimated value of  and has an expected service period of years 
in  we recognized  related to this grant 
the second grant of  performance units which also vest in  share increments based upon our stock price reaching stipulated levels was calculated to have a fair value of  and an expected service period of years 
in we recognized  of compensation expense related to this grant 
we incurred  of severance and related fees related to toc s former ceo 
the remainder of the increase in selling  general and administrative fees related primarily to increased research fees to support our selling efforts  consulting fees pertaining to assistance in the development of our strategic plan  accounting fees for the audit of our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in related to the fiscal year  legal fees incurred in the first quarter as a result of our ongoing efforts related to our carriage agreement negotiations and to other operating costs 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative costs will continue to increase over the foreseeable future 
such increases are expected to result from the amortization of subscriber acquisition fees  also referred to as launch support fees  in excess of the related subscriber revenue as well as other marketing  advertising and promotion expenses as we continue to work to gain increased distribution of our channel  as well as from increases in other corporate expenses 
we anticipate we will incur compensation costs in the amount of  in the year ending december  related to the performance units granted to our new ceo 
impairment of intangible assets for the year ended december  carried a charge of  as a result of our quarterly impairment review of amortizable intangible assets and goodwill 
during the year ended december   we engaged third party consultants to review our business practices and strategy 
among the areas reviewed was our approach to grow our subscriber base through our relationships with our msos 
prior to this time our strategy was to focus on incremental growth opportunities without impacting our existing subscriber base 
our consultants completed a market survey and other steps they deemed appropriate 
in september  the consultants concluded  and the board of directors accepted their conclusions  that a complete revision of the terms of the relationships was necessary to meet the subscriber growth goals established by us 
upon acceptance of that conclusion and general strategy outlined by the consultants  we reviewed our amortizable intangible assets for impairment 
among the components of the plan was subscriber rate relief in some form for both existing subscriber relationships and the incremental if any subscribers that might be added to our subscriber base as a result of the planned actions 
acknowledging the changed circumstances  we assessed the fair value of our amortizable intangible assets and concluded that our mso relationships asset had become fully impaired 
accordingly we have charged to expense  the carrying value of  during the year ended december  we further concluded that the carrying values of our other intangible assets have not been impaired nor do we believe that the changed circumstances have affected the estimated lives of the amortizable intangible assets 
however  these estimates will continue to be reviewed during each reporting period to determine whether circumstances continue to support their estimated useful lives and fair value 
estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in the determination of the fair value 
a significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill or the amortizable intangibles and a non cash charge would be required 
such a charge could have a significant effect on our reported net earnings 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation primarily relates to our broadcast facility which was placed into service april  income loss from operations income loss from operations for the year ended december  was a loss of  a decrease of  compared to income of  for the year ended december  as discussed above  the losses in the year ended december  were driven by the impairment of amortizable intangible assets resulting in a charge of  during the period 
this loss was partially offset by growth of our revenue 
the decrease experienced over the year ended december  was compounded by increased programming costs associated with the launch of our second channel  outdoor channel hd  in the second half of  the expensing of programming costs related to programs we no longer anticipate airing  increased compensation expense resulting from the adoption of sfas r and the transition of our senior management team  increased legal fees relating to our carriage agreements and depreciation related to our newly opened broadcast facility 
as we continue to strive to grow our subscriber base which involves increased advertising expenditures  possible subscriber rate relief to our carriage partners and the ongoing and planned payment of launch support  we will continue to incur increased expenses such as programming  marketing and advertising that are unlikely to be immediately offset by revenues 
as a result  we anticipate our operating margins will be negatively impacted over the short term future until scale is achieved to reverse the trend 
there can be no assurance that these strategies will be successful 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was  an increase of  compared to  for the year ended december  this is attributable to having obtained two term loans in november with an original aggregate principal amount of  with effective fixed interest rates of and 
we repaid these loans in october and do not expect to incur interest expense in the foreseeable future 
other income other income for the year ended december  was  an increase of  compared to  for the year ended december  this improvement was primarily due to increased dividends and interest earned on our increased average balances of our investment in available for sale securities and cash and cash equivalents 
income loss before income taxes income loss before income taxes as a percentage of revenues was for the year ended december  compared to for year ended december  the toc segment s loss before income taxes was  for the year ended december   a decrease of  from income of  for the year ended december  toc s loss before income taxes for the year ended december  was significantly impacted by the  write off of our mso relationship amortizable intangible asset and the additional compensation charges associated with the transition of our senior management including severance and related charges of  and performance unit expense of  additional increased compensation expense resulted from of the adoption of sfas r of  further  we placed our new broadcast facility into service april   which resulted in depreciation expense of approximately additionally  programming costs increased as a result of having launched our second channel  outdoor channel hd  at the beginning of the third quarter of and the planned non airing of certain programs resulting in a write off of their capitalized costs 
also  we incurred incremental expenses in subscriptions and research to support our programming and selling efforts 
offsetting the increased expenses were increases in subscriber fee revenue from deeper penetration of our network with some of our carriers  increased prices charged for the service  increased advertising revenues as a result of increased prices charged to our third party producers and to short form advertisers principally related to the increasing nielsen universe estimate 
the membership division segment s income before income taxes increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  expressed as a percentage of revenues  the membership division segment s income before income taxes improved to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  revenue increased  or in the year ended december  the improvement is principally a result of a renewed interest in gold prospecting  which we believe is partially driven by rising gold prices 
contributing to the improving segment margin was a slight decrease in personnel with the commensurate savings of payroll  payroll related expenses and travel costs 
the decline in margin in the year ended december  is increased compensation incurred as a result of the adoption of sfas r on january  resulting in stock compensation expense of  not incurred in the same period of corporate incurred a loss before income taxes for the year ended december  amounting to  an increased loss of  compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  the expenses allocated to corporate include professional fees such as public relations  accounting and legal fees  amortization of intangibles  business insurance  board of directors fees and expenses  and an allocation of corporate officers payroll and related expenses 
effective january   we prospectively adopted sfas r and corporate incurred a charge to compensation expense related to stock options of  in the year ended december  corporate also was allocated additional payroll costs reflecting the increased time spent by executive officers on corporate matters instead of operating matters 
offsetting these increased costs was interest and dividend income earned on our cash and investment in available for sale securities and lower accounting fees compared to a year ago due to less impact from the implementation of sarbanes oxley procedures 
income tax provision benefit income tax benefit for the year ended december  was  a change of  as compared to an income tax provision of  for the year ended december  the change was principally due to our incurring a loss in the year ended december  as compared to income generated in the year ended december  and the application of sfas r as it relates to the expensing of and concomitant income tax effect of accounting for share based compensation 
the effective income tax provision benefit was approximately and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net income loss net income loss for the year ended december  was a net loss of  a decrease of  compared to a net income of  for the year ended december  the decreases were due to the reasons stated above

subscriber fees are solely related to the outdoor channel 
membership income is generated by our activities other than the operation of the outdoor channel and includes membership sales  magazine sales  merchandise sales  and sponsored outings and expeditions in connection with gpaa and lost dutchman s 
total revenues for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to revenues of  for the year ended december  the net increases were the result of changes in several items comprising revenue as discussed below 
advertising revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  for december  nielsen estimated that the outdoor channel had million viewers compare to million for the same period a year ago 
nielsen revises this estimate each month and for march  nielsen increased its estimate to approximately million subscribers 
the increase in advertising revenue for the year ended december  reflects a larger percentage of our short form advertising inventory being sold to national and endemic advertisers  generally at higher rates  than inventory being sold to direct response advertisers or long form infomercial advertisers 
subscriber fees for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in subscriber fees for the period was primarily due to an increased number of paying subscribers both from new affiliates and from existing distributors and contractual subscriber fee rate increases with existing service providers carrying the outdoor channel 
membership income for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or compared to  for the year ended december  we do not consider this decline to be significant  rather the relatively static balance reflects our belief that this revenue source has reached relative maturity 
we do not expect significant change in the balance from year to year in the near term 
cost of services total cost of services for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  total cost of services was and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect cost of services to continue to increase in the future as we expand our existing markets and in house production to support our advertising strategy 
programming expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is principally a result of our decision to launch our second channel  outdoor channel hd  on july  in  this channel was programmed with native high definition shows produced almost entirely in house as opposed to the preponderance of third party production on our standard definition channel 
we produced in excess of shows plus numerous specials in house that aired in the third and fourth quarters of in some situations  shows that ran in on only one of our channels are planned to be aired again in  but on our other channel 
we aired shows that were internally produced during the third and fourth quarters of satellite transmission fees for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase reflects an additional charge for the back up satellite capability negotiated with our satellite provider during the fourth quarter of and a scheduled price increase of  per month in october production and operations costs for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in costs principally relates to increased infrastructure including personnel  small equipment purchases and other items as we produce more shows in house and support our new broadcast facility 
other direct costs for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in other direct costs principally relates to increased alaska trip expenses with greater number of participants and increased costs in publishing our magazine 
other expenses total other expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  total other expenses were and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in other expenses was due to the non recurring charge to compensation expense incurred in september as a result of the issuance of options to toc employees with an intrinsic value of  in accordance with the terms of the acquisition by the company of substantially all of the remaining minority interest in toc it did not already own 
otherwise total other expenses increased as illustrated when the non cash  non recurring compensation expense of  incurred in september is excluded 
total other expenses  net of the compensation expense from exchange of stock options  increased  or for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  total other expenses  net of compensation expense from the exchange of stock options  were and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in other expenses was due to several factors  such as increased corporate costs including amortization of intangible assets  costs associated with compliance with sarbanes oxley act of  and costs associated with incorporation in delaware and listing on the nasdaq national market  to which we became subject as of september those increased costs will continue to be incurred becoming part of our cost of doing business 
the increase is also attributable to increased personnel costs  costs associated with the launch of our second channel  outdoor channel hd  marketing and promotion costs and other items more fully described as follows 
advertising expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in advertising expenses is principally a result of our increased spending on consumer and trade industry awareness campaigns designed to build demand for the outdoor channel and for outdoor channel hd 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of employees late in and early we opened our new york city advertising sales office with a resultant expense in that did not exist in the same period a year ago 
we have also added an executive to our management team who holds the position of general counsel 
others have been added in all departments to support our launch of a second channel outdoor channel hd 
we also experienced increased travel and related costs associated with our larger advertising sales staff  support of our service providers and the promotion of the outdoor channel and outdoor channel hd through a stronger presence at trade shows and conferences 
small equipment purchases increased as a result of our activity related to the launch of outdoor channel hd 
we increased other corporate overhead expenses such as our activity surrounding sarbanes oxley compliance in  fees for our listing on nasdaq national market and fees associated with incorporation in the state of delaware 
compensation expense from the exchange of stock options for the year ended december  was  and was incurred as a result of the issuance of  options to toc option holders in accordance with the terms of the acquisition of substantially all of the remaining minority interest in toc we did not already own 
this charge is both non cash and non recurring 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase relates primarily to the inventory of hd cameras and edit equipment that we begun purchasing in and continued in to support our increased efforts to produce more of our programming in house as opposed to licensing such programming from third parties 
also contributing to the increase is a full year of amortization expense related to the intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of the minority interest of the outdoor channel  inc  in september income loss from operations income loss from operations for the year ended december  was  a change of  compared to  for the year ended december  as a percent of revenues  income loss from operations was and  respectively 
as explained above  the non cash  non recurring compensation charge of  which resulted from the assumption of options in connection with the acquisition of the minority interest in toc  accounts for the majority of the loss from operations for the year ended december  if we excluded this charge  loss from operations for the year ended december  would have been income from operations of  as a percentage of revenue this adjusted balance would have been for the year ended december  interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was  an increase of  compared to  for the year ended december  this is attributable to having obtained two term loans in november with an original aggregate principal amount of  with effective fixed interest rates of and 
other income other income for the year ended december  was  an increase of  compared to  for the year ended december  this improvement was primarily due to increased dividends and interest earned on our increased investment in available for sale securities and cash and cash equivalent balances that resulted from the sale  on july   of  shares of common stock for net cash proceeds of  plus  from the exercise of stock options during the year ended december  income loss before income taxes and minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiary income loss before income taxes and minority interest as a percentage of revenues was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the toc segment s income before income taxes and minority interest increased to  for the year ended december  from a loss of  for the year ended december  expressed as a percentage of revenue  the toc segment s income before income taxes and minority interest increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the toc segment s income before income taxes  excluding the non cash  non recurring charge of  was  or of revenue 
the change in toc segment s income before income taxes after the non cash compensation charge was due mainly to the growth of our programming expenses and increased staff in support of the launch of our second channel  outdoor channel hd  increased spending on advertising  personnel and travel promotional related expenses as well as depreciation expenses related to the deployment of additional equipment 
the membership division segment s income before income taxes and minority interest decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  expressed as a percentage of revenues  the membership division segment s income before income taxes and minority interest decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease is principally a result of a increase in payroll and related taxes along with a charge for stock compensation that did not exist in corporate incurred a loss before income taxes and minority interest for the year ended december  amounting to  a change of  compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  the expenses allocated to corporate include professional fees such as public relations  accounting and legal fees  business insurance  board of directors fees and expenses and an allocation of corporate officers payroll and related expenses 
income tax provision benefit income tax provision for the year ended december  was  a change of  as compared to a benefit of  for the year ended december  the increase was principally due to the company earning taxable income in as compared to a loss for the effective income tax rate was approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiary minority interest for the year ended december  was  minority interest was eliminated in september as a result of our acquisition of the remaining minority interest in toc we did not already own 
therefore  there was no minority interest for the year ended december  net income loss net income loss for the year ended december  was  a change of  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was due to the reasons stated above 
excluding the non cash  non recurring charge of  net of income tax benefit of  net income for the year ended december  would have been  or of revenue 
liquidity and capital resources we generated  of cash in our operating activities in the year ended december   compared  in the year ended december  and had a cash and cash equivalent balance of  at december   a decrease of  from the balance of  at december  we also had short term investments classified as available for sale securities of  at december   an increase of  from the balance of  at december  the investments at december  were comprised principally of auction rate securities  with interest rates that generally reset every days 
the auction rate securities have long term maturity dates and provide us with enhanced yields 
various equity securities  make up the remainder of the december  balance 
we believe we have the ability to quickly liquidate the auction rate securities at their original cost although there is no guaranty we would be able to do so 
net working capital increased to  at december   compared to  at december  net cash used in investing activities was  in the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in investing activities was related principally to the net difference of sales and purchases of short term auction rate securities 
in  we received net proceeds from the sale of common stock of  that was invested during the year resulting in the higher amount used for investing in additionally contributing to the decrease in cash used by investing activities was a decrease in capital expenditures in compared to in  we acquired equipment related to our hd signal and production in anticipation of the launch of our second channel on july  also  in  we purchased a number of vehicles we use in support of affiliate sales and our annual alaska trip 
we completed the purchase of and had begun the construction of improvements on a building to house our broadcast facility in incurring approximately million in capital expenditures in we have substantially completed the building improvements and placed the facility into service on april  additional capital expenditures were for fixed asset replacements 
in  we have planned general replacement capital expenditures of to million and possibly the acquisition of some land adjacent to our broadcast facility to be used for a parking facility 
if we are successful in acquiring this property  we would complete the build out of warehouse space to move the remainder of our toc and corporate staff  vacating space we currently rent 
we believe the total project cost would be between to million and that we have sufficient capital either on hand or to be generated from operations to fund these acquisitions 
cash used in financing activities was  in the year ended december  compared to cash provided by financing activities of  for the year ended december  the cash used in financing activities in the year ended december  was primarily for the retirement of our long tem debt  offset by the proceeds from the sale of shares upon the exercise of stock options and estimated tax benefits from the exercise of stock options in excess of recognized expense 
we also used  to purchase and retire shares of stock from employees to satisfy the employees income taxes due as a result of the shares having vested 
we also received  from the exercise of stock options 
the cash provided by financing activities in was from the completion  on july   of a public offering of our common stock  whereby we sold  shares of common stock and received net proceeds of  in addition certain selling stockholders exercised options to buy  shares of common stock  which were resold in the public offering 
on july   the underwriters exercised their over allotment option granted by certain selling stockholders and purchased an additional  shares of common stock 
the shares sold by the selling stockholders were purchased immediately before the sale through the exercise of options they held to buy common shares from the company 
the company received  in the aggregate from the exercise of these options 
the company also received cash proceeds of approximately  from the exercise of other options for the purchase of  shares of common stock 
in accordance with sfas r  we have presented on a prospective basis the tax benefits from exercise of stock options in excess of recognized expense of  as a cash flow from financing activities in the accompanying unaudited consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december   rather than as a cash flow from operating activities  as was prescribed under accounting rules applicable through december  tax benefits from the exercise of stock options in excess of recognized expense of  has been included as a cash flow from operating activities for the year ended december  on november   we renewed our revolving line of credit agreement the revolver with us bank us the bank  extending the maturity date to september  and increasing the total amount  which can be drawn upon under the revolver from  to  the revolver provides that the interest rate shall be libor plus 
the revolver is collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
this credit facility contains customary financial and other covenants and restrictions  as amended on november   including a change of control provision and certain minimum profitability metrics which  as amended  exclude the effects of non cash share based employee compensation expense measured at each quarter end 
as of december  and as of the date of this report  we did not have any amounts outstanding under this credit facility 
on november   we obtained a  mortgage loan from the bank on our recently purchased building that houses our broadcast facility located in temecula  california which had a year term loan with a year amortization schedule 
this loan carried a variable interest rate of libor plus 
this loan was secured primarily by a deed of trust on the property and was also secondarily secured by the same assets as the revolver 
it also contained customary financial and other covenants and restrictions including a change of control provision and certain minimum profitability metrics which  as amended  excluded the effects of non cash share based employee compensation expense measured at each quarter end 
on november   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the bank to reduce the potential impact of increasing interest rates and effectively fixed the interest rate on this loan at 
on november   we obtained a  five year fully amortizing term loan 
this loan carried a variable interest rate of libor plus 
this term loan was secured by the same assets as the revolver and contained customary financial and other covenants and restrictions including a change of control provision and certain minimum profitability metrics which  as amended  exclude the effects of non cash share based employee compensation expense measured at each quarter end 
on november   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the bank to reduce the potential impact of increasing interest rates and effectively fixed the interest rate on this term loan at 
this loan was obtained to help finance the equipment and leasehold improvements bought in relation the build out of our broadcast facility including delivery of our hd signal and production 
because we did not supply our financial statements for the three and nine months ended september  within the time frame prescribed by the bank and because we did not meet the minimum profitability covenant for the three months ended september   we were in violation as of that date of two covenants relating to our two term loans and our revolving line of credit facility 
accordingly  these loans were callable by the bank 
on october   we elected to retire the two long term loans  which had an aggregate balance of  plus accrued interest thereon 
on march   we received notification that these covenant violations were waived for these occurrences but that these covenants continue for future periods 
as of december   we were in compliance with the debt covenants and expect to be in compliance at least through december  as of december   we had sufficient cash on hand and expected cash flow from operations to meet our short term cash flow requirements 
management believes that our existing cash resources including cash on hand and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations at current levels and anticipated capital requirements through at least march  to the extent that such amounts are insufficient to finance our working capital requirements or our desire to expand operations beyond current levels  we could seek additional financing 
there can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available if needed or  if available  will be on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year over year less than years over years less than years after years operating lease obligations standby letter of credit purchase obligations other long term liabilities total operating lease obligations principally relate to commitments for delivery of our signal via satellite 
purchase obligations relate to purchase commitments made for the acquisition of programming  advertising and promotion including magazine advertisements and radio show sponsorships  talent agreements  equipment or software maintenance  research services and other operating purchases 
other long term liabilities represent our severance agreement obligation with our former ceo of toc and our compensation commitments with our current ceo under his employment contract 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december  and  our investment portfolio included fixed income securities of  and  respectively 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
however  due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates over time may increase our interest expense 
we do not have a significant level of transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars and as a result we have very limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the effect of an immediate change in foreign exchange rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
as of december  and as of the date of this report  we did not have any outstanding borrowings 
the rate of interest on our line of credit is variable  but we currently have no outstanding balance under this credit facility and in fact remain in default under its terms 
because of these reasons  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material  immediate impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows
