under the provisions of sfas r  the estimated fair value of share based awards granted under its equity based compensation plans is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award 
the company used the modified prospective method of transition under which compensation expense is recognized for all share based payments i granted after the effective date of adoption and ii granted prior to the effective date of adoption and that remain unvested on the date of adoption

the provisions of sfas require that a goodwill impairment test be performed annually or on the occasion of other events that indicate a potential impairment 
the annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles was performed and indicated that there was no impairment for the fiscal years  and goodwill amounting to million and million was reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december  and january   respectively

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which requires that realization of an uncertain income tax position must be more likely than not ie  greater than percent likelihood of receiving a benefit before it can be recognized in the financial statements 
fin further prescribes the benefit to be recorded in the financial statements as the amount most likely to be realized assuming a review by tax authorities having all relevant information and applying current conventions 
the interpretation also clarifies the financial statement classification of tax related penalties and interest and sets forth new disclosures regarding unrecognized tax benefits 
this interpretation is effective as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after december  the company expects to adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of fiscal the company has evaluated the effect of adopting fin and does not believe it will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation the company does not believe that the general level of inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations during the past three fiscal years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions and select accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most critical estimates relate to revenue recognition  the collectibility of accounts receivable and related reserves  the cost of claims incurred but not reported and obligations under insurance programs  which include workers compensation  professional liability  property and general liability  and employee health and welfare insurance programs 
a description of the critical accounting policies and a discussion of the significant estimates and judgments associated with such policies are described below 
revenue recognition revenues recognized by the company are subject to a number of elements which impact both the overall amount of revenue realized as well as the timing of the collection of the related accounts receivable 
in each category described below  the impact of the estimate  if applicable  undertaken by the company with respect to these elements is reflected in net revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
see further discussion of the elements below under the heading causes and impact of change on revenue 
in addition  these elements can be impacted by the risk factors described in risks related to gentiva s business and industry and risks related to healthcare regulation  which appear in part i  item a of this report 
fee for service agreements under fee for service agreements with patients and commercial and certain government payers  net revenues are recorded based on net realizable amounts to be received in the period in which the services and products are provided or delivered 
fee for service contracts with commercial payers are traditionally one year in term and renewable automatically on an annual basis  unless terminated by either party 
under fee for service agreements with certain managed care customers  the company also estimates the revenue related to claims incurred but not reported in situations in which the company is responsible for care management and patient services are performed by a non affiliated provider 
the estimate of revenue for claims 
table of contents incurred but not reported involves applying a factor based on historical patterns of service utilization and payment trends to the services authorized at each of the company s regional coordination centers 
the company evaluates the assumptions and judgments used in determining this factor on a quarterly basis utilizing the trailing months of claims payments  and changes in estimated unbilled receivables for claims incurred but not reported are determined based on this evaluation 
changes in the estimate are recorded as net revenues in the company s consolidated statements of income 
there have not been any material revisions in this estimate for the periods presented in this filing 
capitated arrangements the company has capitated arrangements with certain managed care customers 
under the capitated arrangements  net revenues are recognized based on a predetermined monthly contractual rate for each member of the managed care plan regardless of the volume of services covered by the capitation arrangements 
net revenues generated under capitated arrangements were approximately percent  percent  and percent of total net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
medicare prospective payment system reimbursements under pps for medicare reimbursement  the company estimates net revenues to be recorded based on a reimbursement rate which is determined using relevant data  such as the severity of the patient s condition  service needs and certain other factors  as well as applicable wage indices to give effect to geographic differences in wage levels 
medicare billings under pps are initially recognized as deferred revenue and are subsequently amortized into revenue over an average patient treatment period 
the process for recognizing revenue to be recorded under the medicare program is based on certain assumptions and judgments  including the average length of time of each treatment as compared to a standard day episode  the appropriateness of the clinical assessment of each patient at the time of certification and the level of adjustments to the fixed reimbursement rate relating to patients who receive a limited number of visits  have significant changes in condition or are subject to certain other factors during the episode 
revenue is subject to adjustment during this period if there are significant changes in the patient s condition during the treatment period or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period 
deferred revenue of approximately million and million relating to the medicare pps program was included in other accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and january   respectively 
there have not been any material revisions in estimates of medicare reimbursements under pps for the periods presented in this filing 
during fiscal  however  the company recorded a revenue adjustment of million to reflect an estimated repayment to medicare in connection with the services rendered to certain patients since the inception of pps on october  in connection with the estimated repayment  cms has determined that home care providers should have received lower reimbursements for certain services rendered to beneficiaries discharged from inpatient hospitals within fourteen days immediately preceding admission to home healthcare 
as of december   the company has reserves of million associated with this repayment  including million recorded in connection with the healthfield transaction 
in late december  medicare began recouping amounts for these items 
although management believes that established reserves  which are included in medicare liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  are sufficient  it is possible that the finalization of repayments to medicare relating to these items could result in adjustments to the consolidated financial statements that exceed established reserves 
settlement issues under interim payment system prior to october   reimbursement of medicare home healthcare services was based on reasonable  allowable costs incurred in providing services to eligible beneficiaries subject to both per visit and per beneficiary limits in accordance with the interim payment system established through the balanced budget act 
table of contents of these costs were reported in annual cost reports which were filed with cms and were subject to audit by the fiscal intermediary engaged by cms 
the fiscal intermediary has not finalized its audit of the fiscal cost reports 
furthermore  settled cost reports relating to certain years prior to fiscal could be subject to reopening of the audit process by the fiscal intermediary 
although management believes that established reserves related to the open fiscal cost report year are sufficient  it is possible that adjustments resulting from such audits could exceed established reserves and could have a material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these reserves are reflected in medicare liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company periodically reviews its established audit reserves for appropriateness and records any adjustments or settlements as net revenues in the company s consolidated statements of income 
there have not been any material revisions in established reserves for the periods presented in this filing 
settlement liabilities are recorded at the time of any probable and reasonably estimable event and any positive settlements are recorded as revenue in the company s consolidated statements of income in the period in which such gain contingencies are realized 
as discussed further under the heading government matters prrb appeal in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  the company received and recorded an aggregate of million during fiscal in settlement of the company s appeal filed with the prrb related to the reopening of all of its and cost reports 
during fiscal  the company received and recorded million in partial settlement of the prrb appeal relating to its cost reports 
the remaining cost report settlements of million were received and recorded during fiscal causes and impact of change on revenue for each of the sources of revenue  the principal elements in addition to those described above which can cause change in the amount of revenue to be realized are i an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation  ii an inability to obtain authorizations acceptable to the payer  iii utilization of services at levels other than authorized  and iv other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
revenue adjustments resulting from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts are recorded as adjustments to net revenues or recorded against allowance for doubtful accounts  depending on the nature of the adjustment 
these are determined by company management and reviewed from time to time  but no less often than quarterly 
each of the elements described here and under each of the various sources of revenue can effect change in the estimates  and it is not possible to predict the degree of change that might be effected by a variation in one or more of the elements described 
while it is not possible to predict the degree of change of each element  we believe that changes in these elements could cause a change in estimate which could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
there have not been any material revisions in these estimates for the periods presented in this filing 
billing and receivables processing the company s billing systems record revenues at net expected reimbursement based on established or contracted fee schedules 
the systems provide for an initial contractual allowance adjustment from usual and customary charges  which is typical for the payers in the healthcare field 
the company records an initial contractual allowance at the time of billing and reduces the company s revenue to expected reimbursement levels 
changes in contractual allowances  if any  are recorded each month 
changes in contractual allowances have not been material for the periods presented in this filing 
accounts receivable attributable to major payer sources of reimbursement are as follows dollars in thousands december  january  medicare medicaid and local government commercial insurance and other gross accounts receivable less allowance for doubtful accounts net accounts receivable 
table of contents the commercial insurance and other payer group included self pay accounts receivable relating to patient co payments of million and million as of december  and january   respectively 
accounts receivable below further outlines matters considered with respect to estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable collection policy the process for estimating the ultimate collection of receivables involves significant assumptions and judgments 
the company believes that its collection and reserve processes  along with the monitoring of its billing processes  help to reduce the risk associated with material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in reimbursement experience  revenue adjustments and billing functions 
collection processes are performed in accordance with the fair debt collections practices act and include reviewing aging and cash posting reports  contacting the payers to determine why payment has not been made  resubmitting of claims when appropriate and filing appeals with payers for claims that have been denied 
collection procedures generally include follow up contact with the payer at least every days from invoice date  and a review of collection activity at days to determine continuation of internal collection activities or potential referral to collection agencies 
the company s bad debt policy includes escalation procedures and guidelines for write off of an account  as well as the authorization required  once it is determined that the open account has been worked by the company s internal collectors and or collection agencies in accordance with the company s standard procedures and resolution of the open account through receipt of payment is determined to be remote 
the company reviews each account individually and does not have either a threshold dollar amount or aging period that it uses to trigger a balance write off  although the company does have a small balance write off policy for non governmental accounts with debit balances under the company s policy is to bill for patient co payments and make good faith efforts to collect such amounts 
at the end of each reporting period  the company estimates the amount of outstanding patient co payments that will not be collected and the amount of outstanding co payments that may be waived due to financial hardship based on a review of historical trends 
this estimate is made as part of the company s evaluation of the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts 
there have not been any material revisions in this estimate for the periods presented in this filing 
accounts receivable reserve methodology the company has implemented a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables based on accounts receivable aging trends 
the company analyzes historical collection trends  reimbursement experience and revenue adjustment trends by major payers including medicare  cigna and other payers as well as by business lines  as an integral part of the estimation process related to determining the valuation allowance for accounts receivable 
in addition  the company assesses the current state of its billing functions on a quarterly basis in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues to determine the impact  if any  on its reserve estimates  which involve judgment 
revisions in reserve estimates are recorded as an adjustment to the provision for doubtful accounts  which is reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
during fiscal  the company recorded an incremental provision for doubtful accounts of approximately million associated with the accounts receivable acquired in the healthfield transaction 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at december   january  and january  was million  million and million  respectively 
additional information regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts can be found in schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts on page of this report 
cost of claims incurred but not reported under capitated arrangements with managed care customers  the company estimates the cost of claims incurred but not reported based on applying actuarial assumptions  historical patterns of utilization to authorized 
table of contents levels of service  current enrollment statistics and other information 
under fee for service arrangements with managed care customers  the company also estimates the cost of claims incurred but not reported and the estimated revenue relating thereto in situations in which the company is responsible for care management and patient services are performed by a non affiliated provider 
the estimate of cost of claims incurred but not reported involves applying a factor based on historical patterns of service utilization and payment trends to the services authorized at each of the company s regional coordination centers 
the company evaluates the assumptions and judgments used in determining this factor on a quarterly basis utilizing the trailing months of claims payments  and changes in estimated liabilities for cost of claims incurred but not reported are determined based on this evaluation 
each of the elements described above can effect change in the estimates  and the company is not able to predict the degree of change that might be effected by a variation in one or more of the elements described 
because of the elements described above  these estimates may change in the future and could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the cost of claims incurred for fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively 
differences in costs between fiscal years relate primarily to changes in business activity in the company s carecentrix operations during the reported periods 
cost of claims incurred but not reported  including any changes in estimate relating thereto  are reflected in cost of services and goods sold in the company s consolidated statements of income 
there has not been any material revisions in estimates of prior year costs related to cost of claims incurred for the periods presented in this filing

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk generally  the fair market value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates
