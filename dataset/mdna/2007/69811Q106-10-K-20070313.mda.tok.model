item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview panacos pharmaceuticals  inc seeks to develop next generation anti infective products through the discovery and development of small molecule oral drugs designed to treat human immunodeficiency virus  or hiv  and other major human viral diseases 
we focus on disease indications where we believe there is a clear unmet medical need and commercial opportunity for more effective therapies 
we believe that a major potential commercial advantage of the hiv market is the shorter clinical development and product review times that have generally preceded the approval of currently marketed hiv drugs than is generally the case for many other disease indications 
because we believe that the most important problem in treating hiv is the emergence of viral strains that are resistant to currently approved drugs  our proprietary discovery technologies focus on novel targets in the virus life cycle  including virus maturation and virus fusion 
our lead product candidate  bevirimat  formerly known as pa  is a once daily oral hiv drug candidate in phase clinical testing 
it is the first in a new class of drug candidates that works by a novel mechanism of action called maturation inhibition that is different from the mechanism of any approved drugs or other drugs known by us to be in development 
this new target for hiv drugs was discovered by panacos scientists and their academic collaborators 
based on currently available clinical data  we believe that bevirimat has the potential to play an important role in treating both treatment experienced hiv patients and patients previously untreated for the disease 
in  we announced the completion of a phase a clinical trial of bevirimat  and provided analysis of the results 
the trial met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in the level of hiv in the blood  known as viral load  in patients treated with bevirimat compared to placebo 
after ten days of the highest dose of an oral solution of bevirimat in the trial  the median reduction in viral load was log  or a decrease 
in june  we initiated a phase b trial of bevirimat at multiple clinical sites in the us in this trial  bevirimat is administered to hiv infected patients in combination with approved hiv drugs 
we are enrolling patients failing current therapy in this trial  who receive either placebo or bevirimat at one of several doses in conjunction with approved hiv drugs 
the primary objective of this trial is to determine an appropriate dose or doses of bevirimat for pivotal clinical trials 
the primary efficacy endpoint of the study is viral load reduction after two weeks of bevirimat dosing on top of patients failing background drug regimens 
additional planned endpoints of this trial include safety after two weeks and twelve weeks  as well as viral load reduction after twelve weeks of dosing 
in december  we announced preliminary results from the first cohort of the phase b trial of bevirimat  which studied a mg bevirimat dose comprising eight mg tablets  a formulation that we had developed specifically for this study 
the results of this cohort confirmed the antiviral activity of bevirimat shown in 
table of contents previous studies 
in the first cohort  however  the bevirimat levels in the blood or plasma concentrations were lower than we expected based on a previous study of the oral bioavailability of the mg tablets  suggesting that the tablet formulation used in this cohort did not deliver the drug as expected 
we believe that these results support going to higher doses  with alternative formulations with the aim of generating greater responses 
we have agreed to a revised trial design with the fda  which will enable us to continue bevirimat dose escalation in the phase b trial as soon as possible while we continue to develop an optimized formulation of bevirimat for late stage clinical development and commercialization 
the next cohorts in phase b will test the efficacy of bevirimat in treatment experienced patients failing current therapy  at increasing doses using the oral liquid formulation which was utilized in the phase a trial 
phase b dose escalation with the liquid will involve day functional monotherapy similar to the first phase b cohort  except that patients will not continue on to extended dosing 
after escalating to the most effective doses of bevirimat  we plan to dose one or more cohorts for a three month period  using an optimized formulation suitable for pivotal clinical trials 
prior to the initiation of the phase b trial  we completed two drug interaction studies  chronic toxicology studies and a clinical bioavailability study of a tablet form of the drug 
to date  we have dosed over patients and subjects at the highest oral solution dose of bevirimat  or mg  used in the phase a trial and have seen a good safety and tolerability profile for bevirimat with no indication of a relationship between adverse events and drug levels 
the fda has granted fast track designation to bevirimat 
fast track designation may be granted to a new drug when the fda determines that the specific indication for which the drug is being studied is serious or life threatening and that the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for that indication 
we have established research and development programs designed to generate second and third generation maturation inhibition products 
we believe that there is the potential for multiple marketed products in this class 
we have filed an ind for one of our second generation maturation inhibitors  pa  and have initiated phase clinical trials 
we also have a research and development program focused on an early step in the hiv virus life cycle  fusion of the hiv virus to human cells 
fusion inhibition is a novel target for oral drug development 
panacos scientists have developed proprietary drug screening technology to identify inhibitors of virus fusion and have used this screening technology successfully to identify novel small molecule hiv fusion inhibitors 
these compounds are currently being optimized with the goal of generating an oral drug candidate suitable for clinical testing 
we believe that we could potentially develop and market bevirimat successfully without a strategic corporate collaboration 
we are  however  also exploring corporate collaboration opportunities to facilitate the development and commercialization of bevirimat 
we intend to evaluate the relative merits of both approaches on an ongoing basis 
company background in march  vi technologies  inc merged with panacos pharmaceuticals  inc  a company incorporated in as a subsidiary of the public company boston biomedica inc and spun off as an independent private company in for accounting purposes  the merger was considered a reverse merger under which the former panacos was considered the acquirer of vi technologies 
accordingly  all financial information prior to the merger date reflects the historical financial results of the former panacos 
the former panacos was founded to develop small molecule therapeutics for hiv and other serious viral infections 
following the merger  the combined company was known as vi technologies  inc until the name was changed to panacos pharmaceuticals  inc in august prior to the march merger  the inactine pathogen reduction system for red blood cells was vi technologies principal development stage program 
we have since terminated the development program for the inactine system 
we were organized under the laws of the state of delaware in december our principal executive offices are located at coolidge avenue  watertown  massachusetts  and our telephone number is our website address is www

table of contents critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
our actual results could differ from these estimates 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and the accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include the following research and development revenue and cost recognition revenues to date have been generated by research contracts and  accordingly  we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
revenues from research contracts are recognized in the period in which the related services are performed and the reimbursable costs are incurred 
we are a development stage enterprise and no revenues to date have been derived from our principal operations 
we are reimbursed for certain costs incurred on specified research projects under the terms and conditions of grants and awards 
we record the amount of reimbursement as grant revenue as the services are provided 
provisions for estimated losses on research grant projects and any other contracts are made in the period when such losses can be determined 
accrued expenses related to research and development programs as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying yet to be invoiced services which have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of services for which we must estimate accrued expenses include services we obtain from contract research organizations in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials  contract service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and consultants 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status  timing and billing of services provided 
although our service providers generally invoice us in arrears for services performed  contract agreements may contain prepayment provisions  which we record in a prepaid account  and offset those amounts when we subsequently incur services related to those prepayments 
contracts vary significantly in length  and may be for a fixed amount  a variable amount based on actual costs incurred  capped at certain limits  or a combination of any of these elements 
activity levels are monitored through communication with vendors  including detailed invoice and task completion review  analysis of expenses against budgeted amounts  and pre approval of any changes in scope of the services being performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs which have begun to be incurred  or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in a given period  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
there were no changes in our estimation methodology for accruing contract services fees that had a material effect on our net losses for any of the years presented herein 
long lived assets our long lived assets  which currently consist of property and equipment  are recorded at cost and amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we generally depreciate property and equipment using the straight line 
table of contents method over their economic life  which ranges from three to ten years 
we amortized acquired intangible assets workforce using the straight line method over the estimated economic life of four years 
during the second quarter of  we wrote off the remaining value of the acquired intangible asset workforce see note to the consolidated financial statements 
determining the lives of our long lived assets requires us to make significant judgments and estimates and can materially impact our results of operations 
asset impairments we review the valuation of long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets  under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

we are required to assess the recoverability of long lived assets on an interim basis whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant decrease in the market value of an asset  significant adverse change in our business or industry  and significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period 
in accordance with sfas no 
 when we determine that the carrying value of applicable long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we evaluate whether the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset 
if such a circumstance were to exist  we would measure an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the particular long lived asset or group of assets exceeds its fair value 
we would determine the fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
use of different estimates and judgments on any of these factors could yield materially different results in our analysis and could result in significantly different asset impairment charges 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded impairment charges of million during at december   our remaining long lived assets consisted of net property and equipment totaling approximately million 
contingencies contingencies are addressed by assessing the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after reviewing the relevant facts and circumstances  seeking outside professional advice of lawyers or accountants  where appropriate  and then making and recording our best judgment of potential loss under the guidance of sfas no 
 contingencies 
this process is repeated in each reporting period as circumstances evolve and are reevaluated 
any changes in our assumptions or estimates that impact our estimates of loss will be recorded in operations immediately in the period of the change 
acquisition we applied purchase accounting in our acquisition of vi technologies  which occurred in march under purchase accounting  we allocate the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon our analysis and estimates of fair values 
our analysis generally includes three approaches to estimate the value of acquired assets 
the cost approach measures the value of an asset by quantifying the aggregate expenditures that would be required to replace the subject asset  given its future service capability 
the market approach employs a comparative analysis of actual transactions in which similar assets have been transferred or which businesses 
table of contents have been sold whose value is comprised largely of assets similar to the subject assets 
the income approach is an estimation of the present value of the future monetary benefits expected to flow to the owner of the asset during its remaining useful life 
we generally use the income approach to estimate the fair value of in process research and development 
we perform a discounted cash flow analysis  utilizing anticipated revenues  expenses and net cash flow forecasts related to the technology 
given the high risk associated with the development of new drugs  we periodically adjust the revenue and expense forecasts to reflect the risk of advancement through the regulatory approval process based on the stage of development in the regulatory process 
such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe the fair value assigned to the in process research and development reflected in our consolidated financial statements is based on reasonable assumptions 
however  these assumptions may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
if the in process research and development is incomplete and has no alternative future value  we record the full value of the in process research and development as an expense in the period of the acquisition

prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for share based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb no 
 as allowed under sfas no 
under the intrinsic value method  no share based compensation expense was recognized in our consolidated statement of operations  when the exercise price of our stock options granted to employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
share based compensation expense was recognized in pursuant to apb no 
associated with the amortization of deferred stock compensation related to the acceleration of the vesting of stock options that were granted prior to the merger between vi technologies and the former panacos and related to non employee grants 
share based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
share based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  included compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas no

r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we elected to retain our method of valuation for share based awards granted beginning in using the black scholes model  which was also previously used for our pro forma information required under sfas no 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex variables which we estimate 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the estimated life of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
given the changes that have occurred at the company since march   we used a blend of two historical volatility rates  along with an implied volatility rate for exchange traded options on our stock  to calculate the expected volatility for grants during the year ended december  the two historical volatility rates were determined by calculating the mean reversion of the daily adjusted closing stock price over the post reverse merger period and a normalized operations period 
the implied volatility was calculated by analyzing the implied volatilities of the publicly traded day call and put options of our common stock 
we concluded that an appropriate weighted average of these three calculations provided for the most reasonable estimate of expected volatility under the guidance of sfas no 
r 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed us treasury bill interest rates appropriate for the expected life of our employee stock options 
the expected life of employee stock options represents a calculation based upon historical exercise experience 
for valuation purposes  we use the experience of all employees taken as a single group

results of operations fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net revenues research funding fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease  million  revenues decreased by to  in from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower nih grant funding and the completion of work under several nih grant funded projects during revenues for both years consisted entirely of grant revenue and subcontractor fees 
we expect revenues for fiscal year to decline and be in the range of  to  research and development fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million million total research and development spending increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in compared to is primarily due to increased spending on the bevirimat development program  which entered phase b clinical studies during the second quarter of  and to our pipeline second generation maturation inhibitor and fusion programs 
non cash stock compensation expense relating to the adoption of sfas r in accounted for  of research and development expense in this compares to million in non cash stock compensation charges recorded in  of which million resulted from the departure of an executive during the fourth quarter of we expect fiscal year 
table of contents research and development expenses to be in the range of million to million 
the increase in research and development expenses in reflects higher expected spending related to bevirimat clinical trials and tablet formulation activities 
general and administrative fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million million general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million during from million for the most important factor contributing to this increase was a million charge resulting from the sudden and unexpected death of our chief executive officer  samuel k 
ackerman  md  in june included in the million charge is a non cash stock compensation charge of approximately million related to the accelerated vesting of dr 
ackerman s options upon his death  pursuant to the terms of his option grants and employment agreement and  for other compensation expenses 
a significant portion of the remaining amount of the increase in general and administrative expenses is attributed to share based compensation expenses of million relating to the adoption of sfas r in this compares to stock compensation charges of  in also contributing to the growth in general and administrative expenses in is the increase in marketing  business development and intellectual property activities and the increased level of public company infrastructure following the merger in march we expect fiscal year general and administrative expenses to be between million and million 
in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of vi technologies in  we recorded an in process research and development charge of million during the first quarter ended march  the amount allocated to in process research and development represented an estimate of the fair value of a purchased in process technology research project that  as of the closing date of the merger  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  the in process research and development primarily represented the estimated fair value of inactine  a vi technologies system for pathogen inactivation of red blood cells 
the initial value of the purchased in process research and development from the merger of million was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to such products based upon management s estimates of future revenues and operating profits to be earned upon commercialization of the products 
these cash flows were discounted back to their net present value and were then adjusted by a probability of success factor 
the final fair value of million included a pro rata allocation of the excess purchase price of approximately million 
in process research and development was expensed immediately upon the consummation of the merger 
there were no in process research and development charges in impairment charges we recorded two impairment charges of million and million in the first quarter of and second quarter of  respectively  producing a combined charge for the year ended december  of million 
the first charge of million consisted of million and million on the property and equipment and the workforce intangible asset balances recorded upon consummation of the merger  respectively 
upon the closing of the merger  we completed an analysis to determine if we were able to recover the adjusted value of our long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we determined that the carrying value of our long lived assets property and equipment and workforce exceeded the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets and workforce  and therefore  wrote down the estimates to the estimated fair values 
the million charge recorded during the second quarter of followed the announcement on june  of our discontinuance of the inactine program  which consisted of  and million on the inactine specific property and equipment and workforce intangible asset balances  respectively  in accordance with sfas no 

table of contents interest income  net fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million  million net interest income increased by million  or  to million in from  in the net increase in interest income resulted primarily from higher average cash and investment balances and higher interest rates in compared to the higher cash and investment balances were directly attributed to proceeds received from the public offering that was completed in october fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net revenues research funding fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million  revenues decreased by to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower nih grant funding in and the completion of several nih grants during revenues for both years consisted entirely of grant revenue and subcontractor fees 
research and development fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million million total research and development expenses increased by to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased spending on the bevirimat development program  increases in research and development infrastructure as a result of the merger and increases in research and development spending for our other programs in hiv 
fiscal year also included a million non cash stock compensation charge resulting from the departure of an executive during the fourth quarter of general and administrative fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million million general and administrative expenses increased by to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the addition of the public company infrastructure of vi technologies as a result of the merger in march interest income  net fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease in  we had net interest income of  compared to net interest expense of  in the net increase in interest income resulted from higher cash balances achieved primarily through financings completed in  including a private placement in march  a rights offering in april  warrant and option exercises  and a secondary public offering in october 
in addition to the effect of higher cash balances in  net interest income increased as a result of reduced interest expense due to reduced debt levels from the prior year 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we currently finance our operations primarily through sales of our securities 
since panacos inception  it has financed its operations through private placements of common stock and preferred stock  public offerings of common stock  and to a lesser extent  grant and subcontract revenue  short term debt and capital lease financing 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and working capital of million compared with cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million on december  on march   vi technologies completed a merger with the former panacos  concurrently with a private placement of its common stock and warrants  which resulted in net proceeds of million 
on april   we completed a rights offering  raising net proceeds of million 
we completed a secondary public offering on october   raising net proceeds of approximately million 
during  panacos completed a series c preferred stock financing  raising million in net proceeds  which was converted to common stock as a result of the merger with vi technologies 
we expect to incur substantial additional research and development expenses that may increase from historical levels as we move our lead compound  bevirimat  through clinical trials  as our second generation maturation inhibitor  pa  enters phase i clinical trials  and as we increase our pre clinical efforts for our fusion inhibitor program 
we expect a decline in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal year in the range of million to million 
based on our current plans and forecasts  we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our operations at current activity levels through our cash activity during fiscal years and was comprised of the following in thousands net proceeds from equity transactions net cash used in operating activities cash used in fixed asset acquisition net cash acquired through merger purchase redemption or sale of available for sale marketable securities  net proceeds from borrowing on notes payable repayment of advances and other debt transfers from restricted cash decrease increase in cash position we intend to explore strategic relationships as one means to provide resources for further development of our product candidates 
we cannot forecast when or whether we will be able to enter into one or more collaboration agreements on favorable terms 
we expect to continue to have  for the foreseeable future  substantial cash requirements annually 
the level of cash resources required will depend on the continuing progress of clinical trials for bevirimat  on the expenditures required to develop our other product candidates  and on expenditures on our research programs 
we plan to fund operations primarily through a combination of cash on hand  marketable securities  additional sales of our equity or debt securities and partnerships for the clinical development of product candidates  such as bevirimat 
development partnerships can include license fees and reimbursement of the cost to conduct clinical trials required to commercialize the product in return for distribution rights following approval of the product by regulatory authorities 
we filed a shelf registration statement on form s in the first quarter of with the sec 
the registration statement was declared effective by the sec in may  and will allow us  from time to time  to offer and sell up to an aggregate of million in equity securities 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain funding  secure additional grants  or enter into commercial partnerships sufficient to fund our operations 
other than proceeds from financings  partnerships and grants  we do not anticipate generating cash flow from operations until the commercial launch of bevirimat in a major market  such as the us or europe 
no assurance can be given as to when  if ever  such commercial launch will occur

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  in accordance with our investment policy  we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally restricted to us government issues  high grade bank obligations  high grade corporate bonds and certain money market funds 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately  in the fair market value of our total portfolio at december
