explanatory note regarding restatements this annual report on form k for our fiscal year ended december  includes restatements of the following previously filed financial statements and data and related disclosures  which resulted primarily from recording additional compensation expense due to changes in the measurement dates of certain equity award grants that were made as a result of the internal investigation into our historical equity award grant practices and modifications previously made to certain granted equity awards our consolidated financial statements for our fiscal years ended december  and  our selected consolidated financial data for our fiscal years ended december    and  and our unaudited quarterly financial data for each quarter in our fiscal year ended december  and the first and second quarters of fiscal year we have filed amended quarterly reports on form q a for the quarters ended march  and june  to reflect the restatements 
see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements and special committee and company findings  to our consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii  item of this annual report for a more detailed discussion of the effect of the restatements 
as announced on november   a special committee was established by our board of directors to conduct an independent investigation relating to the company s equity compensation grant practices and related accounting for equity compensation grants 
the special committee consisted of two independent members of our board of directors who were assisted in their investigation by independent outside legal counsel 

table of contents getty images  inc 
form k together with its independent counsel  the special committee conducted an extensive review of equity compensation grant practices and awards made by the company  or in connection with companies we acquired  between july  and november  the relevant period  which covered  stock option grants and  restricted stock unit rsu grants made on occasions 
during the investigation  numerous documents were reviewed  and extensive interviews of current and former employees and directors of the company and other individuals were conducted by the special committee s independent counsel 
on april   the special committee presented its findings to the board of directors 
as also announced on november   the securities and exchange commission the sec had earlier notified us that it is conducting an informal inquiry into the company s equity compensation grant practices 
we continue to cooperate fully with the sec in this informal inquiry 
we have not amended and do not intend to amend any of our previously filed annual reports on form k or quarterly reports on form q for the periods affected by the restatements other than through this document  except for the quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended march  and june  previously filed financial statements for fiscal years ended through  the interim periods contained therein  together with all earnings and other press releases containing our financial information for those periods and the earnings releases for the quarters ended march   june   september  and december  should not be relied upon 
the special committee s conclusions the special committee concluded that the evidence obtained and reviewed in its investigation did not establish any intentional wrongdoing by current employees  officers or directors of the company 
the special committee and the company s management have determined that incorrect measurement dates for certain equity compensation awards were used for financial accounting purposes and certain previously issued grants were modified without properly recording compensation expense and  as a result  we are restating certain of our prior financial statements to correct the accounting for those awards 
the use of incorrect measurement dates resulted from a number of reasons  including delays in the approval of awards  the absence of definitive documentation and modifications of previously awarded grants 
the special committee also identified certain awards for which grant dates were selected retroactively 
however  the special committee has concluded that the evidence does not establish that there was any intentional wrongdoing in connection with those awards 
nearly all of the grants for which the measurement dates have been changed approximately of the grants were awarded in and earlier years 
in addition to the adjustments to our previously filed financial statements as described above  the board of directors has adopted the following recommendations of the special committee 
two additional independent directors will be recruited and appointed to the company s board of directors 
membership of the audit and compensation committees of the board of directors will be changed 
the equity compensation committee has been discontinued 
enhancements will be made in the oversight of the company s corporate governance practices with respect to the company s equity compensation programs 
senior management will be charged with ensuring that the equity compensation policies and processes are appropriate and provide effective controls  and that the company s accounting for equity compensation is appropriate 
certain of the company s equity compensation administrative processes and functions will move from the company s human resources organization to the finance organization  under the supervision of the chief financial officer 
the board of directors unanimously adopted an equity compensation grant policy on april   which provides  among other things  that all terms of each equity grant must be finalized and approved by the board of directors or the compensation committee on or prior to the grant date  all stock options must have an exercise price equal to or greater than the average of the high and low market price on the grant date  all recipients of equity grants must be notified  in writing  of such grants as soon as possible following approval  and any equity compensation issues or actions will be reported by senior management on a timely basis to the board of directors or the compensation committee  no less frequently than quarterly

form k background between and  the board of directors granted stock options to getty communications getty images predecessor employees and in connection with acquisitions  including grants to employees and officers of acquired companies 
from to  the compensation committee had the authority to  and did  grant options to employees  officers and directors 
from august through  the compensation committee continued to grant options to executive officers  and created option pools from which the chief executive officer and senior vice presidents were authorized to grant options to employees and non executive officers 
these pools were used by the executive officers to grant options in connection with the hiring and promotion of employees or as incentive awards 
in august  the board of directors created the stock option committee  appointing chief executive officer jonathan klein as the sole member with delegated authority to grant options to employees and non executive officers 
in  the stock option committee was renamed the equity compensation committee  and we moved to primarily granting rsus rather than options 
a total of  option grants and  rsu grants were awarded during the relevant period  as follows pool options in which pools of options were approved by the compensation committee for later grant to employees by executive officers  grants 
acquisition option grants in which options were granted by the board of directors or compensation committee to employees and officers in connection with our acquisition of other companies and in which outstanding options held by employees of acquired companies were exchanged for getty images options at pre determined conversion ratios  grants 
other option grants which cover all remaining stock option grants during the relevant period  grants 
rsu grants in which rsus were granted by the equity compensation committee  the compensation committee and the board of directors to employees  officers and directors  grants 
the special committee and the company have determined that it is necessary to revise the measurement dates for approximately of these awards adjusted options 
over half of the awards for which the measurement date is being revised relate to the company s only all employee grant in february of to employees below the vice president level 
in addition  the measurement dates for many awards were revised due to i the use of the date of the approval of a pool of options as the measurement date as opposed to the date that the terms of each grant were finalized  ii the use of the date that a unanimous written consent approving equity awards was faxed to compensation committee members for their approval  rather than the date when the approvals of the compensation committee members had been faxed back  as the measurement date for the associated grants  and iii the absence of a detailed list of recipients and associated grants prior to the date certain grants were entered into our equity award tracking system 
we previously applied accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  through our fiscal year ended december  we have used the accelerated method of expensing stock options provided in financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans for recording expense and for our pro forma disclosures 
under apb opinion no 
 a non cash  stock based compensation expense was required to be recognized for any option for which the exercise price was below the market price on the measurement date 
because most of the company s adjusted options had an exercise price below the market price on the measurement date  there should have been a non cash charge for each of these options under apb opinion no 
equal to the number of option shares  multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the measurement date 
that expense should have been amortized over the service period of the option 
the company also reviewed modifications made to previously granted options and determined that we did not record the appropriate amount of compensation expense for some of the modifications modified options 
we did not record the appropriate amount of stock based compensation expense under apb opinion no 
related to adjusted or modified options in our previously issued financial statements  and are recording these expenses in this annual report on form k

form k part ii item the restatements included in this annual report on form k include equity compensation adjustments arising from the special committee investigation and management s internal review  as well as from deferred tax adjustments related to certain long term intercompany loans and adjustments to revenue and deferred revenue that were previously considered immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
the income statement impact of the restatement is as follows years ended december  total effect at december  cumulative effect at december  in thousands net income  as previously reported additional compensation expense tax related effects additional compensation expense  net of tax other adjustments  net of tax total decrease in net income net income  as restated amounts resulted from improper measurement dates for stock awards and modifications 
the table below shows the after tax compensation expense as originally reported  the amount of the additional compensation expense and the restated compensation expense for all years that were restated 
after tax compensation expense in thousands as reported adjustment as restated equity based compensation is not deductible for corporate income tax purposes in most countries 
the after tax amounts in the table reflect reduction of compensation expense for tax benefits in the united states in all years and in the united kingdom in for the united kingdom prior to and for all other countries in all years  there is no tax benefit recorded for the associated compensation expense 
in addition  in  we analyzed our existing net deferred tax assets dtas and determined that not all the existing dtas would be realized over the period covered by our analysis and therefore recorded a valuation allowance equal to approximately million 
we performed a similar analysis in and as a result  increased the valuation allowance associated with the exercise of employee stock options in to million 
in  we updated our estimate of future taxable income and determined that it was now more likely than not that we would realize more of the dta than the net balance at december  therefore  we reduced our valuation allowance by million  including the million related to stock option exercises 
we reviewed the valuation allowance in light of the restatement of equity based compensation and determined that an additional valuation allowance of million should be recorded at december  and then released at december  
table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part ii item as noted above  we have also made two adjustments to deferred tax assets that were previously considered immaterial 
the first item related to the accounting for unrealized foreign currency gains and losses on long term intercompany loans between our united states and united kingdom subsidiaries 
we incorrectly recorded deferred tax assets on the unrealized foreign currency gains and losses in the united kingdom from to  instead of recording them as part of the net foreign currency translation adjustments losses gains within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the second item related to an intercompany loan established in for which we did not include the unrealized gains or losses in taxable income  causing our deferred taxes related to our net operating losses to be misstated and other comprehensive income to also be misstated 
the revenue and deferred revenue adjustment relates to fees paid by photographers for making certain of their images available for license on our website for two years 
we had previously recognized these fees when received  as they were previously considered immaterial  and are now recognizing the fees ratably over the two year period  resulting in a decrease in revenue and an increase in deferred revenue in the periods reported herein 
in addition  we evaluated the impact of the restatements on our consolidated tax provision 
the company and our subsidiaries file tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world 
in the united states for all years reflected above and the united kingdom in and subsequent years  we are able to claim a tax deduction relating to stock options exercised 
in those jurisdictions where a tax deduction will be allowed  we have recorded deferred tax assets to reflect future tax deductions to the extent we believe such assets to be recoverable 
in addition  we also determined that  as a result of the changes in the measurement dates  we should not have taken a deduction in the us in prior years for stock option related amounts pertaining to certain executives under the internal revenue code section m 
section m limits the deductibility of compensation above certain thresholds 
as a result  our tax liabilities have increased by approximately million 
if certain of the adjusted or modified options are not repriced  the holders of such options will  upon exercise of the options  incur personal income taxes and penalties in accordance with internal revenue code irc section a and other state tax laws beyond what they would have incurred were the options not adjusted or modified 
certain of these options have already been exercised and therefore incremental taxes and penalties have been incurred by the holders  while other affected options remain outstanding 
we are currently evaluating the company s position with respect to reimbursing employees for incremental taxes and penalties incurred and to potentially repricing the affected options that remain outstanding 
if the company takes such actions it will result in a charge to compensation expense in the period the decision is made or the expense is incurred  as applicable 
this restatement did not affect cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows

ownership of imagery does not pass to customers who license the imagery from us 
licensing methods customers may license images using one of four licensing methods rights managed  rights ready  royalty free or subscription 
we group our still and moving image collections into categories corresponding to these licensing methods 
we offer portfolios of creative imagery for license under each of these methods  while editorial imagery may be licensed through subscriptions or rights managed licenses 
for rights managed licensing  the license fee is based on how the image will be used  including geographical distribution  license duration  medium  exclusivity and circulation 
for example  an image to be used as an eighth of a page photo in a brochure to be distributed in one city for three months will cost less to license than an image to be used in a global advertising campaign for a year that includes print advertising  billboards and point of purchase displays 
we also offer flexible license packs  which are designed to provide customers a quick and cost effective way to license an image for multiple preset media without having to enter into separate license agreements 
for rights ready licensing  the license fee is based on how the image will be used with eight broadly defined usage categories 
for example  an image to be used for commercial purposes in a print advertisement or display will cost more to license than an image to be used for an internal company communication piece 
there is a ten year duration limitation on each license and no restrictions on geographic distribution 
for royalty free licensing  the license fee is based on the size of the digital file  from standard resolution to high resolution 
once the customer has licensed an image  that customer may use that image multiple times for multiple projects without paying additional fees 
royalty free images may be licensed on a single image basis  as part of a collection of images on a cd or virtual cd a group of images offered online for one fee  or through a subscription 
all images licensed through our micropayment site istockphoto

risk factors the special committee investigation of our equity compensation grant practices  the ongoing informal inquiry by the sec and restatement of our past financial statements may have continuing adverse consequences as discussed in the explanatory note regarding restatements section of this annual report on form k  the special committee of our board of directors has conducted an independent investigation relating to our equity compensation grant practices  with the assistance of independent outside legal counsel 
the special committee and our management have determined that incorrect measurement dates for certain equity compensation awards were used for financial accounting purposes and certain other previously issued grants were modified without properly recording compensation expense 
although the special committee did not find any evidence of intentional wrongdoing by current employees  officers or directors of the company  as a result of the foregoing events  we may be subject to significant risks 
each of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations we are subject to  and cooperating fully with  the ongoing informal sec inquiry  which may require further management time and attention and cause us to incur additional accounting and legal expense and or substantial fines or other penalties  we may be subject to additional formal or informal regulatory proceedings  actions or litigations with the sec or other governmental authorities  we may be subject to further civil litigations arising from the special committee s investigation  the sec inquiry  or our restatement of our past financial statements  including but not limited to shareholder class action lawsuits and derivative claims made on behalf of us  and many members of our senior management team and our board of directors may be required to devote a significant amount of time on matters relating to the continuing informal sec investigation  our outstanding periodic reports  remedial efforts and potential further litigation 
the delay in filing our reports with the sec may result in adverse consequences for the company we did not meet the required filing dates for our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september   our annual report on form k for the year ended december  or our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march  with the filing of this annual report we are now current with our filings up to december   but have not filed our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march  by the required filing date 
as a result  there may be consequences that arise from the delay in filing the reports related to our convertible subordinated debentures  our other senior debt or our stock award plans 
increased competition could reduce our revenues  margins and operating results the visual content industry is and has been intensely competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
we expect competition to increase because of changes in the media industry  changing advertising practices  technological advances leading to relatively inexpensive creation  marketing and distribution of visual content  and a lack of substantial barriers to entry 
our competitors range in size from significant media companies to individual visual content producers 
while we believe the breadth of our businesses and product and service portfolio offers benefits to our customers that are a competitive advantage  our current or potential competitors may develop products  licensing models  technology or services comparable or superior to those that we develop or may adapt more quickly than we do to new or emerging technologies or evolving industry trends 
increased competition or more effective competitors could result in lost market share  having to reduce prices or otherwise having reduced revenue  lower margins  increased capital expenditures  or otherwise negatively impact our operating results 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
see the listing of some of our current and potential competitors under the heading competition in item of this annual report 
our financial results and stock price may fluctuate we expect our revenues and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  both within and outside of our control 
some of the factors that may affect our revenues and operating results include the following demand for our existing and new imagery and related services  and those of our competitors  changes in our pricing or licensing models  policies and practices and those of our competitors  
table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part i item a changes in the mix of imagery licensed and services sold  including the mix of licensed uses  company owned versus contributor supplied imagery  and the geographic distribution of such licenses  each of which affects the price of a license and or the royalty we pay on the license  our ability to attract and retain customers  our ability to manage the costs of our business  including the costs associated with maintaining and developing our websites  customer support  and international and product line expansion  costs related to potential acquisitions and the development and or use of technology  services or products  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in global capital markets and economic conditions  and changes to applicable tax laws and regulations  the termination or expiration of certain image partner  distributor or other material agreements  and changes in estimates and assumptions made by us in preparing our financial statements  including those discussed in the critical accounting policies and estimates and assumptions section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under item in part ii of this annual report on form k 
because of these risks and others  it is possible that our future results may differ from our expectations and the expectations of analysts and investors  causing our stock price to fluctuate 
you should not rely on the results for any period as an indication of future performance 
our acquisition strategy may be dilutive to existing shareholders and we may not be successful in acquiring or integrating businesses as part of our business strategy  we have in the past acquired and invested in  and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that could complement or expand our business 
acquisitions may require significant capital infusions or investments  and may negatively impact our results of operations 
further  the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions  as well as the integration of acquired businesses  may divert management time and other resources 
certain other risks related to acquisitions that may have a material impact on our business or prevent us from benefiting from an acquisition or investment include costs incurred in performing due diligence and professional fees relating to potential acquisitions  use of cash resources  incurrence of debt or stockholder dilution through issuances of our securities to fund acquisitions  assumption of actual or contingent liabilities  known and unknown  amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets  impairment of any goodwill acquired and other adverse accounting consequences  difficulties and expenses in integrating the sales  marketing  operations  products  services  technology  financial and information systems of an acquired company  retention of key employees  customers  and suppliers of an acquired business  and an adverse review of an acquisition or potential acquisition  or limitations put on such acquisitions  by a regulatory body 
we may experience system and service disruptions and difficulties the digitization and internet distribution of our visual content is a key component of our business 
as a result  we are particularly dependent upon  and have expended significant resources to ensure  the efficient functioning of our websites and the technology behind them to allow our customers to access and conduct transactions through our websites 
we also have focused significant resources and attention on the installation and development of systems for technology  business processes  sales and marketing systems  royalty and other finance systems  customer interfaces  and other corporate administrative functions  on which we depend to manage and control our operations 
we will need to continue to improve our websites and systems  as well as our network infrastructures  to improve our customer experience and to accommodate anticipated increased traffic  sales volume  and processing of the resulting information 
if we experience significant disruptions or difficulties as a result of or during any such updates or upgrades  we may face system interruptions  poor website response times  diminished customer services  impaired quality and speed of order fulfillment  and potential problems with our internal control over financial reporting 
substantial or repeated system disruption or failures would reduce the attractiveness of our websites significantly 

table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part i item a in the past  we have experienced infrequent and brief system interruptions that made portions of our websites unavailable or prevented us from efficiently uploading images to our website  or taking  processing or fulfilling orders 
our websites have in the past occasionally experienced slow response times 
additionally  we depend on certain third party software and system providers for the processing and distribution of our imagery and related services 
system disruptions and difficulties  whether as a result of our internally developed systems or those of the third party providers  may inconvenience our customers and or result in negative publicity  and may negatively affect our ability to provide services and the volume of images we license and deliver over the internet 
these types of occurrences in the future could cause users to perceive our sites as not functioning properly and cause them to use another website or other methods to obtain the products or services we offer 
additionally  the computer and communications hardware necessary to operate our corporate functions are located in metropolitan areas worldwide 
any of these systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  earthquake and similar events 
in certain of our offices and facilities  we may not have complete redundancy for all of our network and telecommunications facilities 
systems security risks and concerns may harm our business an important component of our business is the secure transmission of confidential information and the transaction of commerce over the internet 
developments in computer capabilities  viruses  or other events could result in compromises or breaches of our systems  website or networks  jeopardizing proprietary and confidential information belonging to us or our customers  or causing potentially serious interruptions in our services  sales or operations 
we continue to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
significant compromises of our security system or the internet may reduce our customers desire to transact business over the internet 
our business and prospects would suffer if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights we rely upon copyright  patent  trade secret and trademark law  assignment of invention and confidentiality agreements and license agreements to protect our proprietary technology  processes  content and other intellectual property 
the steps we might take may not be adequate to protect against infringement and misappropriation of our intellectual property by third parties 
similarly  third parties may be able to independently develop similar or superior technology  processes  content or other intellectual property 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our intellectual property rights could enable third parties to benefit from our technology and imagery without paying us for it 
if this occurs  our business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  disputes concerning the ownership or rights to use intellectual property could be costly and time consuming to litigate  may distract management from other tasks of operating the business  and may result in our loss of significant rights and the impairment of our ability to operate our business 
our products and services may infringe on intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement could require us to incur substantial costs and distract our management from time to time we receive notices from third parties claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights 
if we are subject to any such infringement claims or are infringing the rights of third parties  we may not be able to obtain licenses to use those rights on commercially reasonable terms  may have to stop selling or to redesign affected products  or may have to pay damages or satisfy indemnification commitments to our customers 
furthermore  a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay damages and also could get an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from using the affected intellectual property 
claims of infringement can be expensive to defend  even if the claim is invalid  and may distract our management from our business 
we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits 
adverse outcomes in some or all of the claims pending against us may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us 
while management currently believes that resolving all of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations  the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future 
there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable

as a result of their share ownership  these shareholders have significant influence over all matters requiring approval of our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of business acquisitions 
the substantial percentage of our common stock held by these shareholders also could make us a less attractive acquisition candidate or have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us at a premium over the then current price of our common stock

in the event that a third party or parties not affiliated with the getty family acquires control of getty images  getty investments llc has the right to call for an assignment to it  for a nominal sum  all rights to the getty images trademarks 
in the event of an assignment  we will have months to continue to use the getty images trademarks  after which time we no longer would have the right to use them 
getty investments right to cause such an assignment might have a negative impact on the amount of consideration that a potential acquirer would be willing to pay to acquire our common stock 
our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees our business is based in part on our ability to successfully attract and retain talented employees 
the market for highly skilled workers is extremely competitive 
if we are unable to retain and motivate key employees or are less successful in our recruiting efforts  our ability to create and distribute superior products and properly service our customers may be adversely affected 
an increase in government regulation of the internet and e commerce could have a negative impact on our business we are subject to a number of laws and regulations directly applicable to e commerce 
state  federal and foreign governments have adopted  and may continue to adopt  legislation regulating the internet and e commerce 
such regulation could both increase our cost of doing business and impede the growth of our business or of the internet  while decreasing the internet s acceptance or effectiveness as a communications and commerce medium 
existing or future laws and other regulations that may impact our business include  but are not limited to  those that govern or restrict privacy issues and data collection  processing  retention and transmission  pricing and taxation of goods and services offered over the internet  website content  or the manner in which products and services may be offered and or marketed over the internet  and sources of liability for companies involved in internet services or e commerce 
we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are involved in many transactions where the ultimate tax determination may be uncertain 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although we believe our tax provisions are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and reserves 
the final determination of such tax liabilities  could have a material effect on our income tax provision  net income  earnings per share  or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made

form k part i item a if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired  we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings under generally accepted accounting principles  we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization  reduced future cash flow estimates  and slower growth rates in our industry 
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets is determined  negatively impacting our results of operations 
we may not be able to obtain external financing or service our indebtedness while we currently anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months  we could be required to obtain external financing should our financial results not meet our expectations  if our convertible subordinated debentures become convertible and require repayment or should we need additional funds to acquire selected businesses or otherwise achieve our objectives 
our convertible subordinated debentures require cash repayment of up to the million of principal upon maturity in  which repayment may be accelerated in full upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined under the indenture governing the debentures 
such an acceleration of the debentures has been threatened 
on february   the trustee under the indenture governing the debentures notified us that  in connection with our delay in filing our quarterly report on form q for the third quarter of  an event of default under the indenture had occurred 
although we believe that such an assertion is without merit and any default under the indenture  to the extent it exists  is cured by our filing of our quarterly report on form q for the third quarter of  our business could be harmed if any such event of default were to occur and the repayment on the debentures were accelerated 
see discussion of the terms of these debentures in the financial condition section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
should we need to obtain external financing  through debt or equity  our ability to do so could be affected by changes in us and global capital markets and economies  significant fluctuations in interest rates  the price of our equity securities  fluctuations in the results of our operations and financial position  and other financial and business conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
changes in accounting may affect our reported earnings and operating income generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements  implementation guidelines  and interpretations for many aspects of our business  such as treatment of tax liabilities  goodwill or intangible assets  are highly complex and involve subjective judgments 
changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in our products or business could significantly change our reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures  without a comparable underlying change in cash flow from operations 
for discussion of some of the significant accounting pronouncements that are currently or we expect will affect our business  see the recent pronouncements under the heading recent accounting pronouncements in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
we operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks we operate in numerous countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from sales outside the united states 
operations outside of the united states may be affected by changes in regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment  social  political  labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations 
while we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure  significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues  operating income  net income and earnings per share  as well as future cash flows 
certain provisions of our corporate documents and delaware corporate law may deter a third party from acquiring us our board of directors has the authority to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote  approval or action by our stockholders 
this authority  together with certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of us 
this could occur even if our stockholders consider 
table of contents getty images  inc

there may be additional lawsuits of this nature filed in the future 
we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits  nor can we predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve these lawsuits 
if the plaintiffs ultimately prevailed in these lawsuits  our insurance coverage would not cover our total liabilities and expenses associated with the lawsuits because we have significant deductibles on certain aspects of the coverage 
in addition  subject to certain limitations  we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors  officers and employees in connection with the investigation and litigation of our historical stock option grant practices and the related government inquiries

form k part ii item we have not amended and do not intend to amend any of our previously filed annual reports on form k or quarterly reports on form q for the periods affected by the restatements other than through this document  except for the quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended march  and june  previously filed financial statements for fiscal years ended through  the interim periods contained therein  together with all earnings and other press releases containing our financial information for those periods and the earnings releases for the quarters ended march   june   september  and december  should not be relied upon 
the special committee s conclusions the special committee concluded that the evidence obtained and reviewed in its investigation did not establish any intentional wrongdoing by current employees  officers or directors of the company 
the special committee and the company s management have determined that incorrect measurement dates for certain equity compensation awards were used for financial accounting purposes  and certain previously issued grants were modified without properly recording compensation expense and  as a result  we are restating certain of our prior financial statements to correct the accounting for those awards 
the use of incorrect measurement dates resulted from a number of reasons  including delays in the approval of awards  the absence of definitive documentation and modifications of previously awarded grants 
the special committee also identified certain awards for which grant dates were selected retroactively 
however  the special committee has concluded that the evidence does not establish that there was any intentional wrongdoing in connection with those awards 
nearly all of the grants for which the measurement dates have been changed approximately of the grants were awarded in and earlier years 
in addition to the adjustments to our previously filed financial statements as described above  the board of directors has adopted the following recommendations of the special committee 
two additional independent directors will be recruited and appointed to the company s board of directors 
membership of the audit and compensation committees of the board of directors will be changed 
the equity compensation committee has been discontinued 
enhancements will be made in the oversight of the company s corporate governance practices with respect to the company s equity compensation programs 
senior management will be charged with ensuring that the equity compensation policies and processes are appropriate and provide effective controls  and that the company s accounting for equity compensation is appropriate 
certain of the company s equity compensation administrative processes and functions will move from the company s human resources organization to the finance organization  under the supervision of the chief financial officer 
the board of directors unanimously adopted an equity compensation grant policy on april   which provides  among other things  that all terms of each equity grant must be finalized and approved by the board of directors or the compensation committee on or prior to the grant date  all stock options must have an exercise price equal to or greater than the average of the high and low market price on the grant date  all recipients of equity grants must be notified  in writing  of such grants as soon as possible following approval  and any equity compensation issues or actions will be reported by senior management on a timely basis to the board of directors or the compensation committee  no less frequently than quarterly 
background between and  the board of directors granted stock options to getty communications getty images predecessor employees and in connection with acquisitions  including grants to employees and officers of acquired companies 
from to  the compensation committee had the authority to  and did  grant options to employees  officers and directors 
from august through  the compensation committee continued to grant options to executive officers  and created option pools from which the chief executive officer and senior vice presidents were authorized to grant options to employees and non executive officers 
these pools were used by the executive officers to grant options in connection with the hiring and promotion of employees or as incentive awards 
in august  the board of directors created the stock option committee  appointing chief executive officer jonathan klein as the 
table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part ii item sole member with delegated authority to grant options to employees and non executive officers 
in  the stock option committee was renamed the equity compensation committee  and we moved to primarily granting rsus rather than options 
a total of  option grants and  rsu grants were awarded during the relevant period  as follows pool options in which pools of options were approved by the compensation committee for later grant to employees by executive officers  grants 
acquisition option grants in which options were granted by the board of directors or compensation committee to employees and officers in connection with our acquisition of other companies and in which outstanding options held by employees of acquired companies were exchanged for getty images options at pre determined conversion ratios  grants 
other option grants which cover all remaining stock option grants during the relevant period  grants 
rsu grants in which rsus were granted by the equity compensation committee  the compensation committee and the board of directors to employees  officers and directors  grants 
the special committee and the company have determined that it is necessary to revise the measurement dates for approximately of these awards adjusted options 
over half of the awards for which the measurement date is being revised relate to the company s only all employee grant in february of to employees below the vice president level 
in addition  the measurement dates for many awards were revised due to i the use of the date of the approval of a pool of options as the measurement date as opposed to the date that the terms of each grant were finalized  ii the use of the date that a unanimous written consent approving equity awards was faxed to compensation committee members for their approval  rather than the date when the approvals of the compensation committee members had been faxed back  as the measurement date for the associated grants  and iii the absence of a detailed list of recipients and associated grants prior to the date certain grants were entered into our equity award tracking system 
we previously applied accounting principles board apb opinion no

 accounting for stock based compensation  through our fiscal year ended december  we have used the accelerated method of expensing stock options provided in financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans for recording expense and for our pro forma disclosures 
under apb opinion no 
 a non cash  stock based compensation expense was required to be recognized for any option for which the exercise price was below the market price on the measurement date 
because most of the company s adjusted options had an exercise price below the market price on the measurement date  there should have been a non cash charge for each of these options under apb opinion no 
equal to the number of option shares  multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the measurement date 
that expense should have been amortized over the service period of the option 
the company also reviewed modifications made to previously granted options and determined that we did not record the appropriate amount of compensation expense for some of the modifications modified options 
we did not record the appropriate amount of stock based compensation expense under apb opinion no 
related to adjusted or modified options in our previously issued financial statements  and are recording these expenses in this annual report on form k

form k part ii item the restatements included in this annual report on form k include equity compensation adjustments arising from the special committee investigation and management s internal review  as well as from deferred tax adjustments related to certain long term intercompany loans and adjustments to revenue and deferred revenue that were previously considered immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
the income statement impact of the restatement is as follows years ended december  total effect at december  cumulative effect at december  in thousands net income  as previously reported additional compensation expense tax related effects additional compensation expense  net of tax other adjustments  net of tax total decrease in net income net income  as restated amounts resulted from improper measurement dates for stock awards and modifications 
the table below shows the after tax compensation expense as originally reported  the amount of the additional compensation expense and the restated compensation expense for all years that were restated 
after tax compensation expense in thousands as reported adjustment as restated equity based compensation is not deductible for corporate income tax purposes in most countries 
the after tax amounts in the table reflect reduction of compensation expense for tax benefits in the united states in all years and in the united kingdom in for the united kingdom prior to and for all other countries in all years  there is no tax benefit recorded for the associated compensation expense 
in addition  in  we analyzed our existing net deferred tax assets dtas and determined that not all the existing dtas would be realized over the period covered by our analysis and therefore recorded a valuation allowance equal to approximately million 
we performed a similar analysis in and as a result  increased the valuation allowance associated with the exercise of employee stock options in to million 
in  we updated our estimate of future taxable income and determined that it was now more likely than not that we would realize more of the dta than the net balance at december  therefore  we reduced our valuation allowance by million  including the million related to stock option exercises 
we reviewed the valuation allowance in light of the restatement of equity based compensation and determined that an additional valuation allowance of million should be recorded at december  and then released at december  
table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part ii item as noted above  we have also made two adjustments to deferred tax assets that were previously considered immaterial 
the first item related to the accounting for unrealized foreign currency gains and losses on long term intercompany loans between our united states and united kingdom subsidiaries 
we incorrectly recorded deferred tax assets on the unrealized foreign currency gains and losses in the united kingdom from to  instead of recording them as part of the net foreign currency translation adjustments losses gains within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the second item related to an intercompany loan established in for which we did not include the unrealized gains or losses in taxable income  causing our deferred taxes related to our net operating losses to be misstated and other comprehensive income to also be misstated 
the revenue and deferred revenue adjustment relates to fees paid by photographers for making certain of their images available for license on our website for two years 
we had previously recognized these fees when received  as they were previously considered immaterial  and are now recognizing the fees ratably over the two year period  resulting in a decrease in revenue and an increase in deferred revenue in the periods reported herein 
in addition  we evaluated the impact of the restatements on our consolidated tax provision 
the company and our subsidiaries file tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world 
in the united states for all years reflected above and the united kingdom in and subsequent years  we are able to claim a tax deduction relating to stock options exercised 
in those jurisdictions where a tax deduction will be allowed  we have recorded deferred tax assets to reflect future tax deductions to the extent we believe such assets to be recoverable 
in addition  we also determined that  as a result of the changes in the measurement dates  we should not have taken a deduction in the us in prior years for stock option related amounts pertaining to certain executives under the internal revenue code section m 
section m limits the deductibility of compensation above certain thresholds 
as a result  our tax liabilities have increased by approximately million 
if certain of the adjusted or modified options are not repriced  the holders of such options will  upon exercise of the options  incur personal income taxes and penalties in accordance with internal revenue code irc section a and other state tax laws beyond what they would have incurred were the options not adjusted or modified 
certain of these options have already been exercised and therefore incremental taxes and penalties have been incurred by the holders  while other affected options remain outstanding 
we are currently evaluating the company s position with respect to reimbursing employees for incremental taxes and penalties incurred and to potentially repricing the affected options that remain outstanding 
if the company takes such actions it will result in a charge to compensation expense in the period the decision is made or the expense is incurred  as applicable 
this restatement did not affect cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
general overview the image licensing business is dynamic and continually introduces opportunities and challenges 
we believe that many opportunities exist in the business of licensing imagery 
we believe that our best opportunities include growth in non english speaking markets  growth in our footage and editorial products  growth and development of istockphoto  our micropayment business  growth in creative stills as a result of the pending launch of our new website  as well as introducing new products and license models 
most recently  the challenges for the business have been associated with the introduction of new alternative licensing models  changing competitive dynamics as well as the shift of communication and advertising to the internet  which has changed the communication methods used by many of our customers 
although we already have products and services available in many markets throughout the world  much of the focus of our business has been in english speaking markets 
the market for visual content in many non english speaking countries remains fragmented  and we believe there is substantial opportunity in these markets 
we plan to accelerate growth in licenses of both editorial and creative imagery in non english speaking countries by expanding our product and service offerings in markets that we have not fully penetrated  by creating or acquiring locally relevant imagery and by localizing language and search capability on our website 
stock footage is a relatively new industry with characteristics similar to stock photography 
footage clips can be used by customers in feature films  television commercials  web advertisements  and corporate videos  all of which are large markets that currently use a high volume of custom shot moving imagery 
our efforts to grow licenses of our footage product include increasing the breadth and depth of our collections  improving our technology to make it easier for our customers to search for and license footage clips and marketing to and educating customers and prospective customers about the benefits of using pre shot footage 

table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part ii item our editorial products have produced healthy revenue growth recently but are still primarily dominated by sales in english speaking markets 
we recently launched the new editorial section of our website at www 
gettyimages 
com and for the first time have a combined database that allows customers to search both editorial and creative content simultaneously 
in addition  we have begun rolling out our editorial products in foreign languages and we expect to eventually offer our editorial products in all of the languages for which we offer our creative content 
the micropayment model has introduced a large number of small office and home office customers to the stock photography market 
these are customers that we believe did not historically license imagery under traditional licensing models 
in february  we acquired istockphoto which we believe is the leader in this new model 
we believe that over time we can employ our expertise in the stock photography business to drive changes and growth in this new market 
the micropayment model also creates some risk for our traditional creative product offerings 
for certain customers and a limited number of projects  we believe that the micropayment image may be a viable substitute 
this had an impact on our traditional creative stills volume in  and we expect it to continue to have an impact in we believe that there are a variety of possible uses of imagery  and our objective is to offer imagery to our customers at all price points 
we believe that our customers will continue to see the value associated with our traditional products and as such  those license models will retain their importance in the stock photography market 
also in  we saw a change in the competitive dynamics in the stock photography market 
our customers have been made aware of competitive alternatives through the increased advertising and marketing efforts of our competitors 
also  our customers have increasing access to  and awareness of  a variety of imagery sources on the internet 
in this environment  we believe our primary competitive differentiators include the highest quality imagery  the broadest and deepest collections and the best tools for use by our customers in finding and purchasing imagery 
we continue to add high quality  relevant imagery to our industry leading collections  we are creating new license models for the benefit of our customers  we lead the industry in creative research and we are revitalizing our website  gettyimages 
com with new features and search functionality in order to improve our customers experience 
operating margins for our business have generally grown over the past five years and continue to be attractive  especially for a media business 
for our traditional creative stills products  we believe we can continue to grow revenue faster than expenses 
however  we have other products with good revenue growth potential that have attractive  yet lower  margin profiles 
growth in revenue from these products may have a slight negative impact on our overall operating margins  as we experienced in revenue we generate our revenue from licensing rights to use visual content and from providing related services 
revenue is principally derived from a large number of relatively small transactions involving licensing rights to use single still images  stock footage or cds containing multiple images 
we also generate revenue from subscription image licenses  from assignment photo shoots and from additional products and services 
in addition to being licensed directly by us  our imagery is also licensed through channel partners distributors and delegates worldwide 
revenue generated from delegates comprised approximately of our revenue in compared to in delegates typically earn and retain to of the license fee paid by their customers  and we recognize the remaining to as revenue 
still imagery we offer still imagery for license through four image portfolios rights managed  rights ready  royalty free  and editorial 
rights managed images are licensed by customers on a use by use basis and generally have higher license fees based on the intended use or application of the image  geographic distribution  license duration  circulation and level of exclusivity 
our rights managed collections are generally considered to represent our highest quality images 
the rights ready model was introduced in the third quarter of  and represents rights managed quality imagery under a simplified license model more akin to the royalty free model 
the license fee for a rights ready image is based on a limited number of broadly defined usage categories with no geographic variable and a ten year license duration 
since its introduction  we have been adding images and collections to our rights ready portfolio and we expect it to grow as a percentage of our total revenue over time 
royalty free images can be used by customers for multiple projects over an unlimited time period 
set pricing is established for royalty free imagery based on the production or artistic value of the image with variability associated with the file size image resolution 
in addition to single image licenses  royalty free imagery can be licensed through cds and subscriptions 
editorial imagery consists of news  sports  entertainment and archival imagery  and is licensed on a single image or subscription basis except for archival 

table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part ii item footage we also maintain portfolios of rights managed and royalty free stock footage  or footage clips  for license by our customers 
these license models for stock footage are essentially the same as those described for our creative stills portfolios 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of royalties owed to contributors  comprised of photographers  filmmakers and image partners 
contributors are under contract with us and typically receive royalties of to of the total license fee  depending on the portfolio as discussed above  where the imagery is licensed licenses outside a contributor s home territory result in lower royalties and the terms of their contract 
we also own the copyright to certain of the images in our collections wholly owned content for which we do not pay any third party royalties 
cost of revenue also includes the cost of shipping and handling hard goods cds  costs of our assignment photo shoots and other costs related directly to the creation of revenue 
cost of revenue excludes depreciation and amortization associated with creating or buying these images 
restructuring costs during  we recorded a total of million of restructuring costs 
approximately million related to consolidation of certain office space in new york and seattle and other related costs and was based on our evaluation of our options regarding the resultant excess space and our estimate of the total loss incurred on that space for the remainder of the respective lease terms 
the remaining million was a severance charge in the fourth quarter related to a realignment of resources 
acquisitions of businesses on april   we purchased all of the shares of pixel images holdings limited  the parent company of star media limited dba stockbyte and stockdisc limited dba stockdisc collectively  stockbyte for million in net cash excluding direct acquisition costs

we also increased our efforts to identify and bill for unauthorized use of our images which allowed us to generate revenue from licenses we would not have received in the past 
revenue generated through our delegates also increased during the year 
revenue from single image licenses of our rights managed portfolio was flat year over year as increased volume was offset by a decrease in the average price per image primarily as a result of a shift in the mix to lower priced usage categories

the market price of our debentures was approximately per debenture at december  the conversion contingencies relating to the credit rating assigned to  and the trading price of the debentures compared to the product of the closing price of our common stock and the conversion rate in effect at such time  as well as the contingent interest feature  represent embedded derivatives 
a valuation of the fair value of these derivatives is performed each quarter 
the fair value of these derivatives was insignificant in all periods presented 
as of december   our debentures were convertible by the holders due to a conversion condition having been met 
the conversion condition was met when the closing price of our common stock exceeded for trading days within the last trading days ended december  as a result  we classified the million of debentures as short term debt on our december  balance sheet 
the condition was not met in the quarter ended december  as a result  we classified the million of debentures as long term debt on our december  balance sheet

during the fourth quarter of  we received two notices of a purported default from certain holders of our debentures 
such notices  purportedly representing an aggregate of approximately of the issued and outstanding debentures  asserted that because we are delinquent in filing our quarterly report on form q for the third quarter of with the securities and exchange commission  we are in default under the indenture dated as of december   between the company  as issuer  and the bank of new york  as trustee the trustee  relating to the debentures 
the notices of default demanded that we cure the purported default within sixty days from their receipt  after which such default would develop into an event of default  as defined in the indenture 
we have not determined the validity of the notices  including the purported ownership interests represented by the notices 
as a result of the sixty day cure period expiring  the trustee gave us a notice of event of default on february  
table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part ii item we believe that we have fully performed our obligations under the indenture because the indenture does not contain an express covenant requiring us to provide the trustee or the bondholders with periodic reports such as the quarterly report on form q for the third quarter of while section a of the trust indenture act of the tia is incorporated into the indenture by virtue of section thereof and contemplates us providing the trustee with copies of our periodic reports  we believe that the tia does not require such reports to be provided within any prescribed period of time 
we intend to furnish to the trustee copies of our quarterly report on form q for the third quarter of after we file such report with the sec 
we believe that such action would cure any default of the indenture provision in question  if any default exists 
consequently  in our view  these notices of default are  and any other similar notices of default that may be received in the future will be  without merit 
as a result  we have classified the debt as long term at december  if it is determined that we are in default  the classification would be changed to short term 
while we have questioned the claimants legal theory as to whether we were in default under the terms of the indenture  if an event of default occurred following the sixty day cure period  the trustee or holders of at least in aggregate principal amount of the debentures then outstanding would have the contractual right to declare all unpaid principal and accrued interest on the debentures then outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
we believe that if an event of default occurred and the debentures are accelerated  we have adequate financial resources to pay any unpaid principal and any interest that would then be due on the debentures 
senior credit facility on may   we entered into a million unsecured senior revolving credit facility with us bank national association 
this credit facility was available for share repurchases  acquisitions of businesses and general corporate purposes 
the interest rate on funds drawn down under the credit facility were day libor plus  and there were no fees in periods when funds are not drawn down 
any funds drawn down under the credit facility were required to be repaid within the day term of the facility 
the credit agreement did not contain financial covenants requiring us to maintain any financial ratios 
the credit agreement contained customary affirmative and negative covenants  as well as customary events of default the occurrence of which could result in termination of the facility and the acceleration of all of our obligations thereunder 
our obligations under the facility were guaranteed by our primary us operating company 
no funds had been drawn down under this facility as of december  subsequent to december   this credit facility was replaced with a new facility  as described below in the subsequent events section 
capital expenditures  contractual obligations and rights  guarantees and other potentially significant uses of cash capital expenditures we spent million  million and million on capital expenditures in  and  respectively 
the increases in and resulted mainly from the acquisition and creation of wholly owned imagery 
wholly owned imagery provides flexible licensing opportunities at a lower cost  as no royalties are required to be paid to contributors 
we had no material commitments for capital expenditures at december  however  we plan to spend approximately million on capital expenditures in  mainly related to the creation of imagery and development of computer software 
the anticipated sources of funds for these capital expenditures are current cash and cash equivalents and cash flows provided by operating activities  but could include any of the sources discussed under liquidity above

years ending december  thereafter total in thousands convertible subordinated debentures principal payments interest payments operating lease payments on facilities and equipment leases minimum royalty guarantee payments to contributors of imagery other purchase commitments total contractual obligations figures assume that the convertible subordinated debentures are repaid upon maturity in  which may or may not reflect future events 
under the terms of the indenture  the holders may require us to redeem the debentures in  and see discussion of these circumstances and the notices of default received due to missing the filing deadline for our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  under convertible subordinated debentures under cash flows provided by financing activities above 
offsetting these operating lease payments will be receipts for subleased facilities in the amounts of in thousands     and for the years ending december       respectively 
see subsequent events below for information on new subleases that will increase sublease income above the amounts presented here 
offsetting these minimum royalty guarantee payments to contributors of imagery will be minimum guaranteed receipts from contributors in the amount of in thousands    for the years ending december     respectively 
payments under purchase orders  certain sponsorships  donations and other commitments that are not enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations are excluded from this table 
payments  guaranteed and contingent  under employment contracts are also excluded from this table because they do not constitute purchase commitments 
guarantees we indemnify certain customers from claims related to alleged infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties  such as claims arising from failure to secure model and property releases for images we license 
the standard terms of these indemnifications require us to defend those claims and pay related damages  if any 
we typically mitigate this risk by securing all necessary model and property releases for imagery for which we hold the copyright  and by contractually requiring our contributing photographers and other imagery partners to do the same prior to submitting any imagery to us 
we also require contributing photographers  other imagery partners and sellers of businesses or image collections that we have purchased to indemnify us in certain circumstances in the event a claim arises in relation to an image they have provided or sold to us 
our imagery partners are also typically required to carry insurance policies for losses related to such claims 
we do not record any liabilities for these indemnifications until claims are made and we are able to assess the range of possible payments and available recourse from our imagery partners  as applicable 
historically  our exposure to such claims has been immaterial  as were our recorded liabilities for intellectual property infringement at december  and as such  we believe the estimated fair value of these liabilities is minimal 

table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part ii item in the ordinary course of business  we also enter into certain types of agreements that contingently require us to indemnify counterparties against third party claims 
these may include agreements with vendors and suppliers  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from our use of their products or services  agreements with customers other than those licensing images  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use of our products or services  agreements with delegates  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their distribution of our products or services  real estate and equipment leases  under which we may indemnify lessors against third party claims relating to use of their property  agreements with directors and officers  under which we indemnify them to the full extent allowed by delaware law against claims relating to their service to us  agreements with purchasers of businesses we have sold  under which we may indemnify the purchasers against claims arising from our operation of the businesses prior to sale  and agreements with initial purchasers and underwriters of our securities  under which we indemnify them against claims relating to their participation in the transactions 
the nature and terms of these indemnifications vary from contract to contract  and generally a maximum obligation is not stated 
because we are unable to estimate our potential obligation  and because we do not expect these indemnifications to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  no related liabilities were recorded at december  or we hold insurance policies that mitigate potential losses arising from certain indemnifications  and historically  we have not incurred significant costs related to performance under these obligations 
other potentially significant uses of cash effective may   our board of directors approved an amendment to our share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of up to million  an increase from the prior authorization of million 
during  we repurchased a total of million shares for million under the amended plan 
these repurchases occurred in the open market pursuant to a trading plan under rule b of the securities exchange act of the repurchase program was suspended in november when we did not file our quarterly report on form q for the third quarter of by the required filing date 
the stock repurchase program will be reviewed after we become current with our sec filings and a decision will be made at that time whether to continue with the program and at what level 
we will continue to consider selective acquisitions of businesses 
during  we paid million in cash for acquired businesses 
cash paid for business acquisitions can vary significantly from year to year due to the timing of identifying and completing acquisitions that contribute to the achievement of our objectives 
we have not paid or declared any dividends since inception  and our board of directors does not anticipate changing this practice in the foreseeable future 
subsequent events stock option review as announced on november   we had received notice of an informal inquiry from the securities and exchange commission into our historical stock option grant practices 
as also announced on november   a special committee of the board of directors was established by our board of directors to conduct an independent investigation relating to our historical equity award grant practices and related accounting for equity compensation grants 
their review and the review conducted by the company were completed in april  prior to the filing of this annual report of form k

funds drawn down under the facility may be used for general corporate purposes  including for acquisitions  redemption or repayment of all or a portion of our existing million of convertible subordinated debentures  and working capital requirements 
on april   we drew down million under the facility to fund  in part  the acquisition of mediavast  inc the interest rate on funds drawn down under the facility ranges from libor plus to depending on our leverage ratio 
we will be charged to on funds available initially million and ultimately million should we elect to increase the available funds but not drawn down 
the facility requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of throughout its term 
our leverage ratio is defined as our total interest bearing debt divided by a trailing four quarter average of our earnings before interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation  amortization  non cash items including equity based compensation expense and any non recurring items 
the facility is subject to customary events of default  including events of default on our other outstanding debt  as applicable  upon the occurrence of which we would be required to immediately repay any funds drawn down under the facility 
fees paid in connection with the establishment of the facility will be deferred and amortized to interest expense over the term of the facility 
acquisitions on april   we purchased all the shares of mediavast  inc for approximately million in net cash 
mediavast  inc  located in new york  ny  is an entertainment photography company  which licenses imagery primarily under the brand name wire image 
the majority of the purchase price is expected to be allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 
we also purchased several other small companies subsequent to december  restructuring on march   we entered into a sublease agreement with new york magazine holdings  llc new york holdings  for  square feet of our excess leased space in  new york  ny

critical accounting policies and estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the revenues and expenses reported during the period 
following are accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee

form k part ii item goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill is the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired through acquisitions of businesses 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually on august and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
when assessing impairment  we estimate the implied fair value of each segment based on a discounted cash flow model that involves significant assumptions and estimates  including our future financial performance  our future weighted average cost of capital and our interpretation of currently enacted tax laws 
at august   the implied fair value of our goodwill exceeded its carrying value in each segment and  therefore  goodwill was not impaired in either segment 
as circumstances change  it is possible that future goodwill impairment tests could result in a loss on impairment of assets  which would be included in the determination of income from operations 
the balance of goodwill at december  was billion 
identifiable intangible assets are assets that do not have physical representation  but that arise from contractual or other legal rights or are capable of being separated or divided from us and sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged 
identifiable intangible assets are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows that we estimate will be generated by the assets and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives see estimated useful lives of certain long lived assets below for more information 
identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
impairment exists when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the discounted cash flow models we use to determine the fair value of identifiable intangible assets involve significant assumptions and estimates  including cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  the estimated useful lives of the assets  and our future weighted average cost of capital 
as circumstances change  it is possible that future impairment tests could result in a loss on impairment of assets  which would be included in the determination of income from operations 
no identifiable intangible assets were impaired during the periods presented 
the majority of the million net book value of our identifiable intangible assets at december  consisted of trademarks  trade names and copyrights million and customer lists  contracts and relationships million 
estimated useful lives of certain long lived assets the estimated useful lives of our most significant property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets are discussed below 
should we determine at some point in the future that the useful lives of these assets are shorter than estimated  it is possible that we would be required to accelerate the amortization  or write off an impaired portion  of these assets 
property and equipment the majority of the million net book value of our property and equipment at december  consisted of imagery million  computer hardware and software million and leasehold improvements million 
the estimated useful lives of imagery are determined based on the number of years over which they generate the majority of their revenue 
periodically  we perform analyses of populations of imagery that are representative of all of our contemporary image collections 
these analyses have shown that the average life of contemporary imagery approximates four years 
the estimated useful life of archival imagery is approximately years 
historical revenue may not be indicative of future revenue  and therefore  these estimated useful lives are inherently uncertain 
the three year estimated useful life of computer hardware and software is determined based on prior experience with related technology  the expected future utility of the assets to us based on our operating plans and industry standards 
hardware and software providers future support of today s technology and the future of technology in general are inherently uncertain 
these lives are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be required  such as significant technological developments  the failure of a vendor to continue to support a particular version of software or changes in operating plans 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining original term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement  ranging from two to years  with the majority of the net book value invested in assets with original estimated useful lives of approximately years 
the estimated useful lives of leasehold improvements are determined based on our prior experience with similar assets and the expected future utility of the assets to us based on our operating plans 
our future operating plans could change and we may choose to  or be required to  terminate our leases and thereby abandon our leasehold improvements prior to the termination of the associated lease or the end of the otherwise estimated useful life 
the estimated useful lives of leasehold improvements are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be required  such as a planned move to or from  or remodeling of  a leased space

form k part ii item identifiable intangible assets as discussed above  the majority of the net book value of our identifiable intangible assets at december  consisted of trademarks  trade names and copyrights and customer lists  contracts and relationships 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant revisions to the remaining periods of amortization 
no revisions were determined to be necessary during the periods presented 
the estimated useful lives of trademarks  trade names and copyrights  ranging from two to years  are generally based on contractual or other legal terms  our plans for use of the assets and the cost and difficulty of renewing the lives of the assets 
the useful lives of these assets may change or terminate prior to the end of their contractual lives due to changes in operating plans  brand strategy  acquisition or disposition of businesses and legal action  among other circumstances 
the estimated useful lives of customer lists  contracts and relationships  ranging from four to seven years  are determined based on our prior experience with customers in general and revenue we expect to generate through these specific customers in the future 
customers are free to terminate their relationship with us at any time  our past experience with one group of customers may not be indicative of our future experience with another group  and past revenue may not be indicative of future revenue 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and in numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments  estimates and assumptions are required in determining our tax return reporting positions and in calculating our provisions for income taxes  as they are based on our interpretation of tax regulations and accounting pronouncements 
we establish reserves for tax uncertainties when  despite our belief that we have appropriate support for positions we have taken on our returns  it is probable that certain of these positions will be challenged and may not be sustained upon review by taxing authorities 
these reserves are established through our income tax provisions and are recorded as long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we recalculate these reserves as governing laws and facts and circumstances change  such as the closing of a tax audit or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a specific exposure 
we are subject to tax examinations by many taxing authorities 
although we believe that our judgments  estimates and assumptions are reasonable  the final determination of our tax liability could materially differ from our expectations 
if this should occur  our consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted 
the existence and valuation of our deferred income taxes  reflecting the impact of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and of tax loss carryforwards  are based on tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  and our interpretations thereof 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income in each applicable tax jurisdiction 
we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets 
deferred us income taxes are not provided for unremitted foreign earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we expect those earnings will be permanently reinvested 
it is not practicable to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to these investments 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified into net current and net non current amounts based on the balance sheet classification of the related asset or liability  or if there is no such asset or liability  according to the timing of the expected reversal of the temporary difference that created the deferred tax asset or liability 
our effective tax rate was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively

foreign exchange gains of million  losses of million and gains of million for the years ended december   and  respectively  arose from changes in the exchange rates underlying intercompany balances deemed to be long term in nature and therefore were included in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income

allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical losses as a percentage of revenue  existing economic conditions  and specific account analysis of at risk customers and delegates 
historical losses and existing economic conditions may not necessarily be indicative of future losses  and the impact of economic conditions on each of our customers is difficult to estimate 
should future uncollectible amounts not reflect our current estimates  we would be required to change our allowance for doubtful accounts through an entry to bad debt expense included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income

recent accounting pronouncements sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements in september  the staff of the sec issued sab no 
in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
traditionally  there have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements the roll over method and the iron curtain method 
the roll over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method  on the other hand  focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement 
we currently use the roll over method for quantifying identified financial statement misstatements 
in sab no 
 the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the roll over methods 
sab no 
permits existing public companies to initially apply its provisions either by i restating prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been used or ii recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of january  with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose 
management has assessed the requirements of sab no 
and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
this statement provides a single definition of fair value  together with a framework for measuring it  and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active markets 
under the statement  fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy 
while the statement does not add any new fair value measurements  it does change current practice 
changes to practice include a requirement for an entity to include its own credit standing in the measurement of its liabilities and to adjust the value of restricted stock for the effect of the restriction even if the restriction lapses within one year 
the statement is effective january  and is to be applied prospectively 
management is currently assessing the impact this statement may have on our consolidated financial statements

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
in july  the fasb issued fin no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes effective january  this interpretation prescribes a two step process to follow in evaluating a tax position we have taken  or expect to take  in a tax return 
first  we must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position 
second  we must measure and recognize all tax positions that meet the first threshold in an amount equal to the largest benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
we will recognize tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
we will derecognize previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
upon initial adoption  we will apply the provisions of this interpretation to all of our tax positions 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date will be recognized or continue to be recognized 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this interpretation will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for the amount of the cumulative effect adjustment will be the difference between the net amount of assets and liabilities recognized in the statement of financial position prior to the application of this interpretation and the net amount of assets and liabilities recognized as a result of applying the provisions of this interpretation 
we will record the cumulative effect of the change in retained earnings in the statement of financial position as of the date of adoption 
the cumulative effect adjustment will be to increase the reserves for uncertain tax positions by approximately million and reduce retained earnings by the same amount

available for sale investments with contractual maturities beyond one year are classified as short term in our consolidated balance sheets because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
debt changes in interest rates have a negligible impact on the fair value of our debentures  while changes in the market price of our common stock cause the fair value of the debentures to fluctuate  sometimes significantly 
these changes are representative of changes in the value of shares of our common stock that we would have to issue to the holders of the convertible subordinated debentures if they were to tender the debentures for conversion 
in periods where the average closing price of our common stock exceeds per share for the last five trading days of a reporting period  we would be required to issue shares for the increase in the value of the debentures above their book value of million

translation gains and losses the statements of income of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars  our reporting currency  at the prior month s average daily exchange rate 
when these exchange rates change from period to period  they cause fluctuations in reported results of operations that are not indicative of fundamental company operating performance but rather that reflect the performance of currencies 
we currently do not hedge against the impact of translation
