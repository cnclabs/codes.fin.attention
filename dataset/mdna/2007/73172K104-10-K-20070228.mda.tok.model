overview we are a leading global provider of a line of high quality  easy to use communications equipment that enables enterprise users to more effectively conduct video  voice  data and web communications 
our offerings are organized along four product lines video communications  voice communications  network systems  and services 
for reporting purposes  we consider each of these separate segments 
our products are unified under the polycom accelerated communications architecture  a framework of common technology principles and objectives for intelligent  standards based communications 
this architecture is designed to facilitate interoperability among systems in a multi vendor ecosystem  leverage common features across a variety of products and streamline management processes 
the polycom accelerated communications architecture serves as the enabling platform for unified collaborative communication  our corporate vision of a unified communications environment for employees  customers and partners to communicate in a dispersed workplace 
the shift from circuit switched telephony networks to internet protocol ip based networks is a significant driver for polycom s collaborative communications markets and for our business 
in  for instance  our voice over ip voip products grew faster than any other product line in the company 
in addition  over half of our group video products and essentially all of our desktop video products were shipped to connect to ip environments in rather than legacy isdn networks 
strategically  polycom is investing much of its research  development  sales and marketing efforts into delivering a superior ip based collaborative 
table of contents communications solution  using polycom proprietary technology in the evolving  standards based ip communications environment 
revenues were million in as compared to million in the increase in revenues primarily reflects increased sales volumes of our voice and video communications products and  to a lesser extent  increases in service revenues 
these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues from our network systems products 
during  we generated approximately million in cash flow from operating activities  which after the impact of other investing and financing activities described in further detail under liquidity and capital resources  resulted in a million net increase in our total cash and cash equivalents 
our video communications  voice communications  network systems and services segment accounted for   and  respectively  of our revenues in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our segments  including a summary of our segment revenues  segment contribution margin  segment inventory and revenue by geography 
on january   we completed our acquisition of destiny conferencing corporation  or destiny  pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of reorganization  or reorganization agreement  dated as of january  destiny designs and manufactures immersive telepresence solutions 
destiny s telepresence solution already incorporates our videoconferencing products and is the basis of our rpx telepresence offering 
as a result of the acquisition  we now own several patents core to telepresence  a rapidly emerging market driven by the need for dispersed people to communicate as if they are all in the same room 
destiny will be reported as part of our video communications and services segments 
destiny s results of operations are not included in our results of operations presented below as the acquisition was completed subsequent to december  additionally  on february   we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire spectralink corporation 
spectralink designs  manufactures and sells on premises wireless telephone systems to customers worldwide that complement existing telephone systems by providing mobile communications in a building or campus environment 
spectralink wireless telephone systems increase the efficiency of employees by enabling them to remain in telephone contact while moving throughout the workplace 
we believe that the spectralink acquisition will position us as the only independent provider of both fixed and mobile solutions that seamlessly encompass voice  video  and data collaboration solutions from the desktop  to the meeting room  to the mobile individual 
spectralink will become part of our voice communications and services segments 
as a result of this acquisition  which is anticipated to close in the first or second quarter of  we expect to incur significant acquisition costs in the period the transaction closes  as well as ongoing integration costs  as we work to integrate the two businesses 
competition that we face in our markets is intense and competition that we face in certain of our international markets is different than what we face in north america and is currently based principally on price 
we have noted additional competitors and increased pricing pressures in china  india and other parts of asia  which contributed to decreased revenues in asia in as compared to although we have had improved year over year performance in asia in  we still see increased competition in this region  particularly in china 
if we are unable to compete effectively in these regions in terms of price  technology  product offerings or marketing strategies  our overall financial results may suffer 
sales of some of our products have experienced seasonal fluctuations which have affected sequential growth rates for these products  particularly in our third and first quarters 
there is generally a slowdown of sales in the european region in the third quarter of each year and sales to government entities typically slow in our fourth quarter and  to a greater extent  in our first quarter 
in addition  sales of our video conferencing products have typically declined in the first quarter of the year compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year 
seasonal fluctuations could negatively affect our business  which could cause our operating results to fall short of anticipated results for such quarters  as they did in the first quarter of 
table of contents on january   we adopted sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based upon estimated fair values 
as a result of adopting sfas r  income before income taxes and net income for the year ended december  were million and million lower  respectively 
the impact on both basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  was a reduction of per share

one channel partner accounted for of our total net revenues and of our video communications segment revenues in no one customer accounted for more than of our total net revenues in or in  one channel partner accounted for of both our video communications and voice communications segment revenues 
no one customer accounted for more than of our voice communications segment revenues in or our video communications segment revenues in one customer accounted for of our voice communications segment revenues in no one customer accounted for more than of our network systems or services segment revenues in  or we believe it is unlikely that the loss of any of our channel partners would have a long term material adverse effect on our consolidated net revenues or segment net revenues as we believe end users would likely purchase our products from a different channel partner 
however  a loss of any one of these channel partners could have a material adverse impact during the transition period 
in  we began selling our audio network systems  a product line obtained through the voyant acquisition  direct to end users and the revenues in the network systems segment from end users are subject to more variability than our revenues from our reseller customers 
the loss of one or more of the audio network system customers could have a material adverse impact on our network systems segment and consolidated revenues 
in  we made changes to our co op marketing program that we provide to our channel partners that generally resulted in co op funds being treated as a marketing expense rather than as a revenue reduction as it was previously 
this change affected how our partners utilize and claim credit for eligible marketing activities and was intended to better leverage our collective marketing efforts 
as a result of this change  revenues  gross profit and marketing expenses all increased in by the amount of co op marketing dollars that would have previously been a reduction of revenues 
this change had no effect on our net income or cash flows 
in  we recorded approximately million for co op marketing programs as a reduction of revenues  which had the co op marketing program changes been in effect for those years  revenues  gross profit and marketing expenses would have increased by approximately that amount 
we typically ship products within a short time after we receive an order and  therefore  backlog has not been a good indicator of future revenues 
as of december   we had million of order backlog as compared to million at december  we include in backlog open product orders which we expect to ship or services which we expect to bill and record revenue for in the following quarter 
once billed  unrecorded service revenue is included in deferred revenue 
we believe that the current level of backlog will continue to fluctuate primarily as a result of the level and timing of orders received and customer delivery dates requested outside of the quarter 
the level of backlog at any given time is also dependent in part on our ability to forecast revenue mix and plan our manufacturing accordingly and ongoing service deferrals as service revenues increase as a percent of total revenue 
in addition  orders from our channel partners are based in part on the level of demand from end user customers 
any decline or uncertainty in end user demand could negatively impact end user orders  which in turn could negatively affect orders from our channel partners in any given quarter 
as a result  our backlog could decline from current levels

cost of product revenues and product gross margins included a million charge for stock based compensation for the year ended december  the comparable and periods do not include any charges for stock based compensation 
generally  network systems segment products have a higher gross margin than products in our video and voice communications segments 
overall  product gross margins decreased by percentage point in as compared to as a result of decreased margins in voice communications and network systems segments  partially offset by increased margins in video communications 
the decrease in voice communications was due to a shift in product mix toward lower margin voice over ip desktop products  as well as increased expenses related to stock based compensation and additional reserves for excess and obsolete inventories 
the increase in video communications gross margins was due to increased average selling prices due to product mix and the fact that the first year of service is no longer bundled in the product price  which was partially offset by increased expenses related to stock based compensation and additional reserves for excess and obsolete inventories 
effective july   we began to separately charge for the initial year of service for our video conferencing products rather than charging one combined price for the product and service 
as a result  we are no longer required to defer a portion of the product revenues to cover the first year of service 
gross margins in our network systems segment were lower in relative to due to decreased margins in both video network systems and network systems software as a result of decreased average selling prices and higher expenses related to stock based compensation 
this was partially offset by increased margins in audio network systems as a result of a higher mix in the software content of these products 
network system margins were impacted by lower average selling prices for our video network systems  primarily as a result of increased competition 
gross margins in our video communications segment increased in as compared to primarily as a result of higher average selling prices on our group video products 
gross margins in our voice communications segment were lower in as compared to primarily as a result of increased voice over ip product revenues which generally have a lower gross margin than our circuit switched and installed voice products 
overall  product gross margins decreased by percentage points in as compared to primarily as a result of decreased margins in our network systems segment 
network system margins were impacted by a decrease in video network system volumes  as well as lower average selling prices  particularly on low end products  primarily as a result of increased competition 
gross margins in our video and voice communications segments were essentially flat year over year 

table of contents additionally  in  we made a change to our co op marketing program that we provide to our channel partners that resulted in co op funds being treated as a marketing expense rather than a revenue reduction as it was previously 
as a result of this change  revenues  gross profit and marketing expenses all increased in by the amount of co op marketing dollars that would have previously been a reduction of revenues 
this change had no effect on our net income or cash flows 
in  we recorded approximately million for co op marketing programs as a reduction of revenues  which had the co op marketing program changes been in effect for those years  revenues  gross profit and marketing expenses would have increased by approximately that amount 
cost of service revenues and service gross margins cost of service revenues consists primarily of material and direct labor  including stock based compensation costs  depreciation  and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
generally  services have a lower gross margin than our product gross margins 
cost of service revenues and service gross margins included a million charge for stock based compensation for the year ended december  the comparable and periods do not include any charges for stock based compensation 
overall  service gross margins increased in over as a result of revenues increasing at a faster pace than related service costs  as well as  a shift in mix of services revenues toward higher margin video maintenance revenues 
service gross margins were also favorably impacted by the amortization of deferred revenue associated with the first year of service on our vsx products that was included in the product price through june  and amortized over the twelve month period following shipment 
these factors were offset partially by increased expenses related to stock based compensation 
overall  service gross margins increased in as compared to as a result of revenues increasing at a faster pace than related service costs and higher margins on audio network systems services 
service gross margins were also favorably impacted by the amortization of deferred revenue associated with the first year of service on our vsx and v products that was included in the product price and amortized over the twelve months following shipment 
forecasting future gross margin percentages for both products and services is difficult  and there are a number of risks associated with maintaining our current gross margin levels 
uncertainties surrounding revenue levels and related production level variances  competition  changes in technology  changes in product mix  variability of stock based compensation costs  litigation outcomes  and the potential of resulting royalties to third parties  manufacturing efficiencies of subcontractors  manufacturing and purchase price variances  warranty and recall costs  such as those we incurred during the first quarter of with the voluntary battery recall used in our soundstation w product  and excess and obsolete reserves  such as the reserve we recorded in the third quarter of related to our qsx and viewstation products  and timing of sales over the next few quarters can cause our cost of revenues percentage to vary significantly 
we may also experience higher prices on commodity components that are included in our products  such as cost increases for memory devices used in many of our products 
in  we incurred cost increases in components that are required to be in compliance with the restrictions on hazardous substances rohs rules in europe 
further  in late  we began including one year of service with some of our video products  which has lowered our gross margins for those products as a result of allocating a portion of our product revenue to deferred service revenue 
however  service gross margins are favorably impacted when the deferred revenue is recorded as revenue 
effective july   we began to separately charge for the initial year of service for our video conferencing products rather than charging one combined price for the product and service 
these actions may not have the desired result of increasing revenues and improving service renewal rates and  accordingly  could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
in addition  cost variances associated with the manufacturing ramp of new products  or the write off of initial inventory purchases due to product launch delays  or the lack of market acceptance of our new products  could occur  which would increase our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues 
in addition to the uncertainties listed above  cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase due to a change in our mix 
table of contents of distribution channels and the mix of international versus north american revenues 
cost of revenues will increase in in absolute dollars as a result of increased compensation charges due to recording stock based compensation expense as well as annual merit increases 
stock based compensation costs associated with stock options are determined through the use of an option pricing model that is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
changes in these underlying factors and assumptions may result in significant variability in the stock based compensation costs we record  which makes such amounts difficult to accurately predict 
sales and marketing expenses year ended december  increase from prior year in thousands expenses of total revenues pts sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for our sales force  stock based compensation costs  advertising and promotional expenses  product marketing expenses  and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs

sales and marketing expenses included a million charge for stock based compensation for the year ended december  the comparable and periods do not include any charges for stock based compensation 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue was flat in as compared to the increase in absolute dollars in over was due primarily to an increase in sales commissions and co op marketing charges as a result of increased revenues  increases in our sales and marketing headcount due to the expansion of our sales and marketing efforts  as well as increased compensation charges due to annual merit increases  incentive accruals and stock based compensation expense 
the increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues in as compared to is primarily due to a change to our co op marketing program that we provide to our channel partners that resulted in co op funds being treated as a marketing expense rather than a revenue reduction as it was in prior years 
for  we recorded approximately million for co op marketing programs as a reduction of revenues  which had the co op marketing program changes been in effect for  marketing expenses would have increased by approximately that amount 
excluding the effect of the co op marketing change  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue increased by for as compared to the increase in absolute dollars in as compared to was due primarily to an increase in our sales headcount due to overall expansion of our sales effort  increased trade show and marketing event activities and the change to our co op marketing program discussed above 
this was partially offset by reduced spending on outside marketing services due to our consolidating these services to fewer vendors 
we expect to continue to increase our sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollar amounts and to increase spending as a percentage of revenues in as we continue to increase our sales coverage and expand our marketing efforts across all our markets through the hiring of additional sales personnel and increased spending on marketing programs 
we also expect to incur increased expenses  especially advertising expenses  to market new products  to increase the adoption rate of our technology and products and to educate potential end users as to the desirability of these products over competing products  especially as we launch new products and as a result of increased competition in the high end video conferencing market 
we also expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in over the levels as a result of the anticipated acquisition of spectralink in and  to a lesser extent  our recent acquisition of destiny 
in addition  sales and marketing expenses will also increase in over the levels as a result of increased compensation charges due to recording stock based compensation expense  as well as annual merit increases and incentive accruals

research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue increased for as compared to  primarily due to spending increasing by in over as compared to revenues increasing in over the increase in absolute dollars in as compared to is due to planned headcount increases and program development expenses to support increased investment in new product initiatives  such as our high definition video and voice products and next generation network systems products  as well as increased compensation charges related to annual merit increases  incentive accruals and stock based compensation expense 
research and development expenses increased in as compared to in our video communications  voice communications and network systems segments 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues for decreased slightly compared to  primarily due to increasing revenues 
research and development expenses decreased in absolute dollars by from million in to million in the decrease in absolute research and development expense dollars was primarily due to decreased headcount related expenses and development spending in our network systems segment  which was partially offset by increases in research and development expenses in the voice communications segments in as compared to we are currently investing research and development resources to enhance and upgrade the products that comprise our unified collaboration communications solutions  which encompass products and services in all our segments  including additional network systems products  products that address the very high end video conferencing market and additional voice over ip products 
in addition  we are investing research and development resources across all segments to support our strategic partnerships 
we anticipate committing a greater proportion of our research and development expenses toward the development of our software and infrastructure products  which are included in the network systems segment  to enhance the integration and interoperability of our entire product suite 
we believe that technological leadership is critical to our success  and we are committed to continuing a high level of research and development to develop new technologies and products to combat competitive pressures 
also  continued investment in new product initiatives will require significant research and development spending 
we expect that research and development expenses in absolute dollars will increase in the future

as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased by percentage point in  as compared to  due to the increase in stock based compensation versus the year ago period 
the increase in spending in absolute dollars in general and administrative in over was primarily due to increased compensation charges related to annual merit increases  increased incentive accruals and stock based compensation expense  as well as legal and project related outside services costs 
this was partially offset by decreased infrastructure costs

the remaining changes are related to numerous smaller items 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased by percentage point in  as compared to  due to the decrease in absolute dollars as well as the increase in revenues from the prior year

the remaining changes are related to numerous smaller items 
significant charges due to costs associated with litigation  including our ongoing litigation against codian  or uncollectibility of our receivables would increase our general and administrative expenses and negatively affect our profitability in the quarter in which they are recorded 
additionally  predicting the timing of bad debt expense associated with uncollectible receivables is difficult 
future general and administrative expense increases or decreases in absolute dollars are difficult to predict due to visibility of costs  including legal costs associated with defending claims against us  as well as legal costs associated with asserting and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and other factors 
general and administrative expenses may also increase as a result of the fee arrangement we have with outside legal counsel representing us in our litigation against codian  pursuant to which we may owe additional legal fees if a favorable outcome in the litigation is ultimately achieved 
such fees would be recorded in the period in which a favorable litigation outcome occurs 
we believe that our general and administrative expenses will also likely continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts in 
table of contents the future primarily as a result of expansion of our administrative staff and other costs related to supporting a larger company  increased costs associated with regulatory requirements  and our continued investments in international regions 
we also expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in over the levels as a result of the anticipated acquisition of spectralink in  and to a lesser extent  our recent acquisition of destiny

we expect acquisition related costs to increase significantly in absolute dollars in over the levels as a result of the anticipated acquisition of spectralink in and  to a lesser extent  due to our recent acquisition of destiny 
purchased in process research and development in and  we incurred charges totaling million and million  respectively  for purchased in process research and development which was acquired as part of our acquisitions of dstmedia and voyant  respectively 
we did not incur any such charges in the research and development acquired in as part of the voyant acquisition was primarily related to development projects for the readivoice series innovox media servers which was completed and commenced shipping in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the amounts allocated to purchased in process research and development were determined by management after considering  among other factors  the results of an independent appraisal based on established valuation techniques in the high technology communications industry  and were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed for these in process research and development projects 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows and risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary technique utilized in valuing the developed technology and in process research and development for dstmedia and voyant 
the estimated net free cash flows generated by the in process research and development projects were discounted at rates ranging from for dstmedia and to for voyant in relation to the stage of completion and the technical risks associated with achieving technology feasibility 
at december   all significant in process research and development projects had been completed 
we expect to expense purchased in process research and development costs in as a result of the anticipated acquisition of spectralink in and  to a lesser extent  our recent acquisition of destiny 
such amounts could be significant depending upon the results of valuing the in process research and development acquired as part of these acquisitions

in and  million and million  respectively  of the total expense related to the impairment of certain intangibles that we acquired in the voyant acquisition 
there were no impairment charges in the decrease in absolute dollars in as compared to was primarily due to the purchased intangibles related to the meetu acquisition becoming fully amortized in  and the impairment of certain intangibles from the voyant acquisition at the end of which reduced the amortization 
these decreases were only partially offset by the addition of purchased intangibles related to the dstmedia acquisition in august of the decrease in absolute dollars in as compared to was primarily due to the purchased intangibles related to the picturetel  circa and apsi acquisitions becoming fully amortized at december  we evaluate our purchased intangibles for possible impairment on an ongoing basis 
when impairment indicators exist  we perform an assessment to determine if the intangible asset has been impaired and to what extent 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment is conducted by first estimating the undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the purchased intangibles and comparing this amount with the carrying value of these assets 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  impairment exists  and future cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate and compared to the carrying amounts of the purchased intangibles to determine the amount of the impairment 
based on the results of the and impairment assessments  we determined that certain purchased intangible assets acquired as part of the voyant acquisition had been impaired as of the respective year end periods  and we recorded impairment charges of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
in  these assets were written down as a result of a decline in the projected future cash flows from future products that will utilize the technology acquired in the acquisition 
the impairment will result in a permanent reduction in future amortization expense of approximately million per quarter through in  these assets were written down as a result of a decline in the projected future cash flows from the oci product line due to its announced discontinuance in the fourth quarter of at december   the carrying value of our purchased intangibles was million 
we expect that purchased intangibles and the related amortization will increase in as a result of the anticipated acquisition of spectralink and  to a lesser extent  the recent destiny acquisition 
such amounts could be significant depending upon the results of valuing the intangibles acquired as part of these acquisitions 
restructure costs during the third quarter of  management approved a restructuring plan for eliminating or relocating certain positions throughout the company in order to consolidate certain functions into one location  as well as to relocate the asia pacific headquarters from hong kong to singapore 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  the company recorded a charge of approximately million in related to workforce reductions and relocations  which events had been communicated to the impacted employees or incurred during the period 
the charge comprised of severance and other employee termination benefits related to these workforce reductions  which impacts less than percent of the company s employees worldwide  and costs related to relocations that have been incurred as of december  as of december   approximately million of the charge remains to be paid out and is expected to be paid out by march  for the employees who will not terminate until the first quarter of and  in accordance with fas  exceed the minimum retention period generally days  as well as for remaining costs associated with employee relocation  facilities closures and moving related expenses  which will be recognized when the company ceases to use the facility or as incurred  a remaining charge of approximately million will be recognized through the first quarter of  for a total charge of million 
during the first quarter of  management approved a restructuring plan for eliminating certain positions throughout the company but focused on the sales and general and administrative functions 
the resulting actions 
table of contents were intended to streamline and focus the company s efforts and more properly align its cost structure with its projected revenue streams 
in accordance with sfas  the company recorded a charge of approximately million in related to workforce reductions  which had been communicated to the impacted employees during the period 
the total charge of million consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits related to these workforce reductions  which comprised less than percent of the company s employees worldwide 
all payments related to these actions have been made as of december  in  we approved a restructuring plan for eliminating or relocating certain positions throughout the company  but focused on the sales and general and administrative functions 
the resulting actions were intended to streamline and focus our efforts and more properly align our cost structure with our projected revenue streams 
in accordance with sfas  we recorded a charge of approximately million for the year ended december  this charge consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits related to the workforce reductions which comprised less than percent of the company s employees worldwide 
all obligations related to these charges were paid or released by december  this charge was partially offset by a release of a remaining reserve that was recorded in related to the restructuring of the network systems segment discussed below  resulting in net restructuring charges for the year of million 
in  we approved a restructuring plan for our network systems segment 
the resulting actions were intended to improve the overall cost structure of the network systems segment by focusing resources on strategic areas of the business  streamlining certain engineering efforts and reducing operating expenses 
in accordance with sfas  the company recorded a charge of approximately million for the year ended december  this charge consisted primarily of severance and other employee termination benefits related to the workforce reductions which comprised less than percent of the company s employees worldwide 
all payments related to these actions have been made 
in the future  we may take additional restructuring actions to gain operating efficiencies or reduce our operating expenses  while simultaneously implementing additional cost containment measures and expense control programs 
such restructuring actions are subject to significant risks  including delays in implementing expense control programs or workforce reductions and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or a decrease in employee morale  all of which would impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions 
if we do not achieve the anticipated cost reductions  our business could be harmed 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation reserves and payments in  there were no litigation reserves and payments or releases of prior reserves 
in  we released less than million of the remaining reserves related to a distributor claim and a tentative settlement of an employment claim that were recorded in the second half of in  we recorded million for litigation reserves and payments of which million was related to the settlement of a patent infringement litigation matter whereby we entered into a settlement agreement with avistar communications  inc avistar and collaboration properties  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of avistar cpi 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we paid avistar a one time amount of million  and cpi agreed to dismiss all claims in the litigation with prejudice 
in addition to the settlement agreement  we  avistar and cpi entered into a patent cross license agreement whereby non exclusive  fully paid up  worldwide patent licenses to the respective patent portfolios of each party and its subsidiaries were granted by us and our subsidiaries to avistar and its subsidiaries  including cpi  and by avistar and its subsidiaries to us and our subsidiaries 
we incurred a one time charge of million in and recorded million as a prepaid license 
we expect to amortize this prepaid license through the third quarter of  the expiration date of the patents under license

gain loss on strategic investments for strategic reasons  we have made various investments in private companies 
the private company investments are carried at cost and written down to fair market value when indications exist that these investments have other than temporarily declined in value 
we review these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist and make appropriate reductions in carrying value  if necessary 
we evaluate a number of factors  including price per share of any recent financing  expected timing of additional financing  liquidation preferences  historical and forecast earnings and cash flows  cash burn rate  and technological feasibility of the investee company s products to assess whether or not the investment is impaired 
at december  and  these investments had a carrying value of million and million  respectively  and are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets

provision for income taxes our overall effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively  which resulted in a provision for income taxes  including taxes related to discontinued operations  of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective rate in versus was due primarily to the one time tax impact of million for the distribution we made in under the american jobs creation act and reduced exposures to foreign cash taxes as a result of agreements on outstanding assessments 
the increase in the effective rate in versus was related primarily to tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign subsidiary earnings under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of  as discussed below  which was partially offset by the decrease in purchased in process research and development  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
in december  we resolved certain tax uncertainties in foreign tax jurisdictions that allowed us to release previously accrued taxes totaling million 

table of contents as of december   we had approximately million in tax credit carryovers and million in capital loss carryforwards  as well as other deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on october   the american jobs creation act the act was signed into law 
the act created a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing a dividends received deduction of for certain dividends  as defined in the act 
during the fourth quarter of  we distributed million in cash from our foreign subsidiary and provided associated income tax expense of million 
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as changes in tax legislation  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof  the geographic composition of our pre tax income  non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions  amounts of tax exempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre tax income  final resolution of the tax impact from the exercise of incentive stock options and the issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase plan  and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
we believe that our future effective tax rate may be more volatile as a result of these factors 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on the derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions

however  a loss of any one of these channel partners could have a material adverse impact during the transition period 
we sell our audio network systems directly to end users  and the revenues in this segment from end users are subject to more variability than our segment revenues from our reseller customers 
the loss of one or more of the audio network system customers in the network systems segment could have a material negative impact on our network systems segment and consolidated revenues

service gross margins increased in as compared to as a result of revenue increasing at a faster pace than related service costs 
service gross margins in were also favorably impacted by the amortization of deferred revenue associated with the first year of service on our vsx and v products that was included in the product price and amortized over the twelve month period following shipment 
this impact was due to increased volumes of these products in as compared to effective july   we began to separately charge for the initial year of service for our video conferencing products rather than charging one combined price for the product and service 
these actions may not have the desired result and  accordingly  could have an adverse impact on our product margins and profitability 
overall  the increase in the services segment contribution as a percentage of services segment revenues in versus is due primarily to increased gross margins more than offsetting increases in operating expenses 
service gross margins increased for as compared to as a result of revenue increasing at a faster pace than related service costs and higher margins on network systems audio services 
service gross margins in were also favorably impacted by the amortization of deferred revenue associated with the first year of service on our vsx and v products that was included in the product price and amortized over the twelve month period following shipment 
this impact was due to increased volumes of these products in as compared to liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
substantially all of our short term and long term investments are comprised of us government securities  state and local government securities and corporate debt securities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we have a million line of credit with a bank which was unused at december   however  we do have outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million  of which million are secured by this line of credit 
we generated cash from operating activities totaling million in  million in and million  net of a million litigation settlement  in the increase in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to increased net income and non cash expenses  larger increases in accounts payable  taxes payable and other accrued liabilities and a smaller increase in inventories 
offsetting these positive effects were a larger increase in accounts receivable  smaller decrease in deferred taxes and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the increase in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to increased net income and non cash expenses  larger decreases in deferred taxes  larger increases in taxes payable and other accrued liabilities  smaller increases in accounts receivable and decreases in prepaid expenses and other current assets  which were partially offset by smaller increases in accounts payable and increases in inventories 
the total net change in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended was an increase of million 
the primary sources of cash were million from operating activities  million associated with the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  million for the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation and million in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments  net of purchases 
the primary uses of cash during this period were million for purchases of our common stock and million for purchases of property and equipment 
the positive cash from operating activities was primarily the result of net income  adjusted for non cash expenses and other items such as depreciation  amortization  the provision for doubtful accounts  inventory write downs for excess and obsolescence  non cash 
table of contents stock based compensation  excess tax benefit from stock based compensation  gain from sale of discontinued operations  amortization of unearned stock based compensation  gain on strategic investments  the purchase of in process research and development and the tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options  reductions in deferred taxes and net increases in accounts payable  taxes payable and other accrued liabilities 
offsetting the positive effect of these items were net increases in trade receivables  inventories and prepaid expenses and other assets 
our days sales outstanding  or dso  metric was days at december  as compared to days at december  this decrease in dso was due primarily to an improvement in revenue linearity in the last month of the quarter 
we expect that dso will continue to fluctuate  and in all likelihood  will increase as a result of fluctuations in revenue linearity  an increase in international receivables which typically have longer payment terms and increases in receivables from service providers and government entities who have longer payment terms of and days  respectively  compared to the normal day terms 
inventory turns increased from turns at december  to turns at december  the increase in turns primarily reflects the increase in revenue levels outpacing the increase in inventories 
we believe inventory turns will continue to fluctuate depending on our ability to reduce lead times  as well as changes in product mix and a greater mix of ocean freight versus air freight to reduce freight costs 
additionally  payments we make for income taxes may increase during as our available net operating losses are depleted 
during the third quarter of  we entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts  which typically mature in one month  to hedge the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations of foreign currency denominated receivables  payables  and cash balances 
we record on the balance sheet at each reporting period the fair value of our forward exchange contracts and record any fair value adjustments in results of operations 
gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on contracts are recorded as other income expense  offsetting transaction gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
additionally  commencing in the third quarter of  we started a hedging program using forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated revenues and operating expenses denominated in the euro and british pound as well as operating expenses denominated in israeli shekels 
at each reporting period  we record the fair value of our unrealized forward contracts on the balance sheet with related unrealized gains and losses as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate element of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses associated with the effective portion of the forward exchange contracts are recorded within revenue or operating expense  depending upon the underlying exposure being hedged 
any ineffective portion of a hedging instrument would be recorded as other income expense 
on january   we completed our acquisition of destiny 
we paid million in cash to destiny shareholders and debtholders in connection with this acquisition 
approximately million of the cash was placed into escrow to be held as security for losses incurred by us in the event of certain breaches of the representations and warranties covered in the reorganization agreement or certain other events 
destiny shareholders may receive an additional million of consideration over a two year period  based on the achievement of certain financial milestones 
on february   we entered into a definitive agreement under which we will acquire spectralink corporation spectralink 
under the terms of the agreement  we have commenced a cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of spectralink for per share 
this represents an enterprise value of approximately million  which is net of existing cash and debt 
the acquisition is expected to close in the first or second quarter of calendar year upon the closing of the acquisition  we also expect to incur related transaction costs of approximately million to million 
as part of the dstmedia acquisition  dstmedia shareholders may receive up to an additional million of consideration through  payable in cash  based on the achievement of certain financial milestones relating to the operating results of dstmedia 
in september  we paid out million in additional consideration to dstmedia shareholders as additional consideration one year following the closing of the acquisition 
dstmedia s results of operations have been included in our results of operations since august  
table of contents from time to time  the board of directors has approved plans to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased approximately million  million and million shares  respectively  of our common stock in the open market for cash of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we were authorized to purchase up to an additional million under the share repurchase plan 
at december   we had open purchase orders related to our contract manufacturers and other contractual obligations of approximately million primarily related to inventory purchases 
we also currently have commitments that consist of obligations under our operating leases 
in the event that we decide to cease using a facility and seek to sublease such facility or terminate a lease obligation through a lease buyout or other means  we may incur a material cash outflow at the time of such transaction  which will negatively impact our operating results and overall cash flows 
in addition  if facilities rental rates decrease or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  we could incur a significant further charge to operations and our operating and overall cash flows could be negatively impacted in the period that these changes or events occur 
these purchase commitments and lease obligations are reflected in our consolidated financial statements once goods or services have been received or at such time when we are obligated to make payments related to these goods  services or leases 
in addition  our bank has issued letters of credit to secure the leases on some of our offices 
these letters of credit total approximately million and are secured by our credit facilities or cash deposits with our banks 
the table set forth below shows  as of december   the future minimum lease payments  net of estimated sublease income of million through june  due under our current lease obligations 
in addition to these minimum lease payments  we are contractually obligated under the majority of our operating leases to pay certain operating expenses during the term of the lease such as maintenance  taxes and insurance 
our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands gross minimum lease payments estimated sublease receipts net minimum lease payments projected annual operating costs other long term liabilities purchase commitments year ending december  thereafter total payments we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents  investments and bank line of credit will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may require or desire additional funds to support our operating expenses and capital requirements or for other purposes  such as acquisitions  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing  debt financing or from other sources 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available at all or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us and would not be dilutive 
our future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the introduction of new products and potential acquisitions of related businesses or technology 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our process used to develop estimates  including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  stock compensation costs  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition and product returns we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred  product payment is not contingent upon performance of installation or service obligations  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product or service is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
additionally  we recognize extended service revenue on our hardware and software products as the service is performed  generally one to five years 
our video communications and network systems products are integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of the equipment 
additionally  we provide unspecified software upgrades and enhancements related to most of these products through our maintenance contracts 
accordingly  we account for revenue for these products in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date 
if there is an undelivered element under the arrangement  we defer revenue based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element  as determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  we defer all revenue until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
we accrue for sales returns and other allowances as a reduction to revenues upon shipment based upon our contractual obligations and historical experience 
channel partner programs and incentives we record estimated reductions to revenues for channel partner programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline or competition were to increase further  we may take future actions to increase channel partner incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time the incentive is offered 
co op marketing funds are accounted for in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
under these guidelines  we accrue for co op marketing funds as a marketing expense if we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the identifiable benefit received  otherwise  it is recorded as a reduction to revenues 

table of contents warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by estimated product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revision of the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the company s customers to make required payments 
the company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly by assessing individual accounts receivable over a specific aging and amount  and all other balances on a pooled basis based on historical collection experience 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable 
excess and obsolete inventory we record write downs for excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
deferred and refundable taxes we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against these tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include and expense the allowance within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   we have million in net deferred tax assets 
in order to fully utilize these deferred tax assets we need to generate sufficient amounts of future us taxable income 
we believe based upon our financial projections that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize these assets and therefore  as of december   we have not established a valuation allowance against these assets 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values in accordance with sfas r 
sfas r requires us to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statements of operations 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for employee equity awards and employee stock purchases using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb as allowed under statement of financial 
table of contents accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
under the intrinsic value method  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations  other than as related to acquisitions  because the exercise price of our stock options granted to employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in purchase combinations the purchase combinations completed require us to identify and estimate the fair value of the assets acquired  including intangible assets other than goodwill  and liabilities assumed in the combinations 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plan for the entities acquired including planned redundancies  restructuring  use of assets acquired and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of obligations assumed for which no future benefit will be received 
for example  in the picturetel acquisition  we identified vacated or redundant facilities that we intended to sublease or for which we intended to negotiate a lease termination settlement 
the allocation period for all material acquisitions  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises  has been completed 
therefore  if actual costs  other than the payment of certain earn outs  exceed our estimates  these charges would be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
if actual costs are less than our estimates  these charges would continue to be recognized as an adjustment to goodwill 
goodwill and purchased intangibles we assess the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles at least annually unless impairment indicators exist sooner 
we assess the impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would typically measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by us to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in the fourth quarters of  and  we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests 
the assessment of goodwill impairment was conducted by determining and comparing the fair value of our reporting units  as defined in sfas  to the reporting unit s carrying value as of that date 
based on the results of these impairment tests  we determined that our goodwill assets were not impaired as of december   or we assess our purchased intangibles for impairment on an ongoing basis 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment is conducted by first estimating the undiscounted expected future cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the purchased intangibles and comparing this amount with the carrying value of these assets 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  impairment exists  and future cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate and compared to the carrying amounts of the purchased intangibles to determine the amount of the impairment 
based on events in the fourth quarters of and  we performed an assessment of our purchased intangibles and we determined that certain purchased intangible assets acquired as part of the voyant acquisition had been impaired as of december  and and we recorded impairment charges of approximately million and million  respectively 
our intangible 
table of contents assets were not impaired as of december  screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the high technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a charge to operations will not occur as a result of future goodwill and purchased intangible impairment tests 
non marketable securities we periodically make strategic investments in companies whose stock is not currently traded on any stock exchange and for which no quoted price exists 
the cost method of accounting is used to account for these investments as we hold a non material ownership percentage 
we review these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate to us that an impairment exists may be a significant decrease in the market value of the company  poor or deteriorating market conditions in the public and private equity capital markets  significant adverse changes in legal factors or within the business climate the company operates  and current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or projections and forecasts that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the company s future business plans 
impairment indicators identified during the reporting period could result in a significant write down in the carrying value of the investment if we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
these investments had a carrying value of million as of december   and were permanently written down by million in  which is reflected in gain loss on strategic investments in the consolidated statements of operations 
there were no amounts permanently written down in or derivative instruments the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
for derivative instruments designated as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged 
for a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
for non designated derivative instruments that do not require special hedge accounting under fas  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we enter into derivatives only with counterparties that are among the largest us banks  ranked by assets  in order to minimize our credit risk

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk prior to  a substantial majority of our sales were denominated in united states dollars 
effective january   we commenced selling our products and services in certain of our european regions in euros and in the united kingdom in british pounds  which has increased our foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk 
while we do not hedge for speculative purposes  as a result of our increasing exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we began purchasing forward exchange contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure to the euro  british pound and israeli shekel in the third quarter of as of december   we had outstanding forward exchange contracts to sell million euros at and million british pounds at  and buy million israeli shekels at 
these forward exchange contracts hedge our net position of foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances and typically mature in one month 
we also commenced a cash flow hedging program in the third quarter of to hedge a portion of anticipated revenues and operating expenses denominated in the euro  british pound and israeli shekels 
as of december   we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts to sell million euros at and million british pounds at and to buy million israeli shekels at 
these forward exchange contracts  carried at fair value  typically have maturities of less than six months 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at of december   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the united states dollar  relative to our foreign local currencies  would have an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we may also decide to expand the type of products we sell in foreign currencies or may  for specific customer situations  choose to sell in foreign currencies in our other regions  thereby further increasing our foreign exchange risk
