item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation included in this annual report 
our sales estimates for future periods are based on estimated end user demand for our products 
sales to our distribution partners would fall short of expectations if distributor inventories increase because of less than estimated end user consumption 
other factors that are beyond our control and that could affect our operating results in the future include seasonal fluctuations in our sales of group a strep and influenza tests  which are generally highest in fall and winter  thus resulting in generally lower operating results in the second and third calendar quarters and higher operating results in the first and fourth calendar quarters  timing of onset  length  and severity of the cold and flu seasons  government and media attention focused on potential influenza pandemic and the related potential impact on humans from avian flu  including the uncertainty surrounding the detection of novel influenza viruses in human specimens and the us government s recent report which focused on vaccination solutions and called for the development of new rapid diagnostic tests  which are not commercially available at this time  that identify specific strains of influenza and have greater sensitivity and specificity  changes in the level of competition  such as would occur if one of our larger and better financed competitors introduced a new or lower priced product to compete with one of our products  changes in the reimbursement systems or reimbursement amounts that end users rely upon in choosing to use our products  changes in economic conditions in our domestic and international markets  such as economic downturns  reduced consumer demand  inflation and currency fluctuations  changes in sales levels  since a significant portion of our costs are fixed costs with the result that relatively higher sales could likely increase profitability but relatively lower sales would not reduce costs by the same proportion  and hence could cause operating losses  lower than anticipated market penetration of our new products  significant quantities of our product in our distributors inventories or distribution channels  and changes in distributor buying patterns 
to remain competitive  we must continue to develop or obtain proprietary technology rights  otherwise  other companies may increase their market share by selling technologically superior products that compete with our products 
our competitive position is heavily dependent on obtaining and protecting our own proprietary technology or obtaining licenses from others 
our ability to compete successfully in the diagnostic market depends on continued development and introduction of new proprietary technology and the improvement of existing technology 
if we cannot continue to obtain and protect proprietary technology  our net sales and gross profits could be adversely affected 
moreover  our current and future licenses may not be adequate for the operation of our business 
our ability to obtain patents and licenses  and their benefits  is uncertain 
we have issued patents both in the us and internationally  with expiration dates ranging from the present through approximately additionally  we have patent applications pending throughout the world 
these pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of any patents  or if issued  may not have priority over others applications or may not offer protection against competitors with similar technology 
moreover  any patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future 
in addition to the us  we have patents issued in various other countries including  for example  australia  canada  japan and various european countries including france  germany  italy  spain and the united kingdom 
third parties can make  use and sell products covered by our patents in any country in which we do not have patent protection 
we also license the right to use our products to our customers under label licenses that are for research purposes only 
these licenses could be contested and  because we cannot monitor all potential unauthorized uses of our products around the world  we might not be aware of an unauthorized use and might not be able to enforce the license restrictions in a cost effective manner 
also  we may not be able to obtain licenses for technology patented by others and required to produce our products on commercially reasonable terms 
in order to remain competitive and profitable  we must expend considerable resources to research new technologies and products and develop new markets 
our failure to successfully introduce new technologies and products and develop new markets could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
we devote a significant amount of financial resources to researching and developing new technologies  new products and new markets 
the development  manufacture and sale of diagnostic products require a significant investment of resources 
moreover  no assurances can be given that our efforts to develop new technologies or products will be successful or commercially viable  including  without limitation  our strategic efforts relating to i our ltf technology platform and migration of products to that platform  ii developing and expanding our molecular diagnostics research and development capabilities  and iii identifying and commercializing new markers and products in bone health 
for example  if we are unsuccessful with our strategic efforts around the development of our ltf immunoassay technology whether as the result of failure to achieve desired clinical end points  commercial viability or a change in strategic direction  we would have an impairment of our assets 
we currently anticipate that we will reach a determination as to our continued investment in our ltf immunoassay technology during as of december   we have approximately million of net assets related to our ltf technology 
the development of new markets also requires a substantial investment of resources  such as new employees  offices and manufacturing facilities 
accordingly  we are likely to incur increased operating expenses as a result of our increased investment in sales and marketing activities  manufacturing scale up and new product development associated with our efforts to provide clinicians with validated  value based proof which encompasses the clinical efficacy and economic efficiency of our rapid poc tests for the professional market  pursue over the counter opportunities with strategic partners  strengthen market and brand leadership in infectious disease and reproductive health  drive growth by establishing dedicated distributor partnerships and expanding our sales organization  drive profit through further refinement of industry leading manufacturing efficiencies  continue to focus our research and development efforts on three areas new proprietary product platform development  the creation of improved products and new products for existing markets  and products developed under collaborations with other companies for new and existing markets  develop and maintain key relationships with third parties and cooperative collaborations  identify and commercialize new markers  products and collaborations in bone health through our spg  and pursue licensing  acquisition and partnership opportunities that meet our dedicated focus on research to rapids 
as a result of any number of risk factors identified in this annual report  no assurance can be given that we will be successful in implementing our operational  growth and other strategic efforts 
in addition  the funds for the foregoing projects have in the past come primarily from our business operations and a working capital line of credit 
if our business slows and we become less profitable  and as a result have less money available to fund research and development  we will have to decide at that time which programs to cut  and by how much 
similarly  if adequate financial  personnel  equipment or other resources are not available  we may be required to delay or scale back our strategic efforts 
our operations will be adversely affected if our net sales and gross profits do not correspondingly increase or if our technology  product and market development efforts are unsuccessful or delayed 
furthermore  our failure to successfully introduce new products and develop new markets could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
we rely on a limited number of key distributors which account for a substantial majority of our net sales 
the loss of any key distributor or an unsuccessful effort to directly distribute our products could lead to reduced sales 
although we have many distributor relationships  the market is dominated by a small group of these distributors 
four of our distributors  which are considered to be among the market leaders  collectively accounted for approximately  and of our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
even though our distributor mix will likely change from period to period in the future  cardinal  ds pharma  ndc and pss have historically accounted for a significant portion of our net sales 
the loss or termination of our relationship with any of these key distributors could significantly disrupt our business unless suitable alternatives were timely found or lost sales to one distributor are absorbed by another distributor 
finding a suitable alternative may pose challenges in our industry s competitive environment  and another suitable distributor may not be found on satisfactory terms 
for instance  some distributors already have exclusive arrangements with our competitors  and others do not have the same level of penetration into our target markets as our existing distributors 
if net sales to these or any of our other significant distributors were to decrease in any material amount in the future  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
as an alternative  we could expand our efforts to distribute and market our products directly 
this alternative  however  would require substantial investment in additional sales and marketing resources  including hiring additional field sales personnel  which would significantly increase our future selling  general and administrative expenses 
if we were to make the substantial investment to directly distribute and market our products and were unsuccessful  our net sales and profits could be materially and adversely affected 
intellectual property risks and third party claims of infringement  misappropriation of proprietary rights or other claims against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products  require us to redesign our products or seek licenses from third parties  and materially adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  the defense of such claims could result in significant costs and divert the attention of our management or other key employees 
companies in and related to our industry often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights 
there are often intellectual property risks associated with developing and producing new products and entering new markets  and we may not be able to obtain  at reasonable cost and upon commercially reasonable terms  licenses to intellectual property of others that is alleged to be part of such new or existing products 
from time to time  we have received  and may continue to receive  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused other parties proprietary rights 
moreover  in the past we have been engaged in litigation with parties that claim  among other matters  that we infringed their patents 
we or our customers may be sued by other parties that claim that our products have infringed their patents or misappropriated their proprietary rights or which may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents 
an adverse determination in any of these types of disputes could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products  limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved in such litigation may perform for us  increase our costs of revenue and expose us to significant liability 
for example and as previously disclosed  beginning in february  a number of legal proceedings were initiated by us  ima and ima s affiliates in germany and the us raising  among other items  issues of patent infringement  patent enforceability and patent invalidity relative to fundamental  lateral flow technology 
in legal proceedings in the us  in addition to ima and ima s affiliates  church dwight was also a party involved in the legal proceedings 
in april  we entered into an agreement with ima settling all domestic and international actions involving ima and ima s affiliates  and we and ima agreed to cross license  and to cause our and their affiliates to cross license  the parties respective lateral flow patent portfolios 
in addition  in march  we settled the pending intellectual property litigation with church dwight and agreed to cross license certain patents related to lateral flow technology for the over the counter market 
as a general matter  our involvement in litigation or in any claims to determine proprietary rights  as may arise from time to time  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations for reasons such as the pendency of any litigation may of itself cause our distributors or end users to reduce purchases of our products  it may consume a substantial portion of managerial and financial resources  its outcome would be uncertain and a court may find any third party patent claims valid and infringed by our products issuing a preliminary or permanent injunction that would require us to withdraw or recall such products from the market  redesign such products offered for sale or under development or restrict employees from performing work in their areas of expertise  governmental agencies may commence investigations or criminal proceedings against our employees  former employees and or us relating to claims of misappropriation or misuse of another party s proprietary rights  an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liability in the form of past royalty payments  penalties  special and punitive damages and or future royalty payments significantly affecting our future earnings  and failure to obtain a necessary license upon commercially reasonable terms  if at all upon an adverse outcome could prevent us from selling our current products or other products we may develop 
in addition to the foregoing  we may also indemnify some customers and strategic partners under our agreements with such parties if a third party alleges or if a court finds that our products or activities have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused another party s proprietary rights 
further  our products may contain technology provided to us by other parties such as contractors  suppliers or customers 
we may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
our contractors  suppliers and licensors may not be required to indemnify us in the event that a claim of infringement is asserted against us  or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum amount  above which we would be responsible for any further costs or damages 
we may not achieve market acceptance of our products among physicians and other healthcare providers  and this would have a negative effect on future sales growth 
a large part of our business is based on the sale of rapid poc diagnostic tests that physicians and other healthcare providers can administer in their own facilities without sending samples to laboratories 
clinical reference laboratories and hospital based laboratories are significant competitors for our products and provide a majority of the diagnostic tests used by physicians and other healthcare providers 
our future sales depend on  among other matters  capture of sales from these laboratories by achieving market acceptance of poc testing from physicians and other healthcare providers 
if we do not capture sales at the levels we have budgeted for  our net sales will not grow as much as we hope and the costs we have incurred will be disproportionate to our sales levels 
we expect that clinical reference and hospital based laboratories will continue to compete vigorously against our poc diagnostic products in order to maintain and expand their existing dominance of the overall diagnostic testing market 
moreover  even if we can demonstrate that our products are more cost effective or save time  physicians and other healthcare providers may resist changing to poc tests 
our failure to achieve market acceptance from physicians and healthcare providers with respect to the use of our poc diagnostic products would have a negative effect on our future sales growth 
intense competition with other manufacturers of poc diagnostic products may reduce our sales 
in addition to competition from laboratories  our poc diagnostic tests compete with similar products made by our competitors 
there are a large number of multinational and regional competitors making investments in competing technologies and products  including several large pharmaceutical and diversified healthcare companies 
we also face competition from our distributors since some have created  and others may decide to create  their own products to compete with ours 
a number of our competitors have a potential competitive advantage because they have substantially greater financial  technical  research and other resources  and larger  more established marketing  sales  distribution and service organizations than we have 
these competitors include  among others  ima  beckman  fisher  genzyme and becton 
moreover  some competitors offer broader product lines and have greater name recognition than we have 
if our competitors products are more effective than ours or acquire market share from our products through more effective marketing or competitive pricing  our net sales and profits could be materially and adversely affected 
competition also has the effect of limiting the prices we can charge for our products 
our products are highly regulated by various governmental agencies 
any changes to the existing laws and regulations may adversely impact our ability to manufacture and market our products 
the testing  manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the us  principally the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
the fda regulates most of our products  which are currently all class i or ii devices 
the us department of agriculture regulates our veterinary products 
our future performance depends on  among other matters  our estimates as to when and at what cost we will receive regulatory approval for new products 
in addition  certain of our foreign product registrations are owned or controlled by our international distribution partners that could result in the loss of or delay in transfer of any such product registrations 
regulatory approval can be a lengthy  expensive and uncertain process  making the timing and costs of approvals difficult to predict 
our net sales would be negatively affected by delays in the receipt of  delay if we change  or failure to receive  approvals or clearances  the loss of previously received approvals or clearances or the placement of limits on the marketing and use of our products 
furthermore  in the ordinary course of business  we must frequently make subjective judgments with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
if regulators subsequently disagree with the manner in which we have sought to comply with these regulations  we could be subjected to substantial civil and criminal penalties  as well as product recall  seizure or injunction with respect to the sale of our products 
the assessment of any civil and criminal penalties against us could severely impair our reputation within the industry and any limitation on our ability to manufacture and market our products could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to numerous government regulations in addition to fda regulation  and compliance with changes could increase our costs 
in addition to fda and other regulations described previously  numerous laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances impact our business operations 
if these laws change or laws regulating any of our businesses are added  the costs of compliance with these laws could substantially increase our costs 
compliance with any future modifications of these laws or laws regulating the manufacture and marketing of our products could result in substantial costs and loss of sales or customers 
because of the number and extent of the laws and regulations affecting our industry  and the number of governmental agencies whose actions could affect our operations  it is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and impact of future legislation or regulatory developments relating to our industry 
to the extent the costs and procedures associated with meeting new requirements are substantial  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we use hazardous materials in our business that may result in unexpected and substantial claims against us relating to handling  storage or disposal 
our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including but not limited to chemicals and biological materials such as dimethyl sulfate  sodium nitrite  acetaldehyde  acrylamide  potassium bromate and radionuclides 
federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous materials 
these regulations include federal statutes popularly known as cercla  rcra and the clean water act 
compliance with these laws and regulations is already expensive 
if any governmental authorities were to impose new environmental regulations requiring compliance in addition to that required by existing regulations  these future environmental regulations could impair our research  development or production efforts by imposing additional  and possibly substantial  costs on our business 
in addition  because of the nature of the penalties provided for in some of these environmental regulations  we could be required to pay sizeable fines  penalties or damages in the event of noncompliance with environmental laws 
any environmental violation or remediation requirement could also partially or completely shut down our research and manufacturing facilities and operations  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated and exposure of individuals to these materials could result in substantial fines  penalties or damages as well 
our net sales could be affected by third party reimbursement policies and potential cost constraints 
the end users of our products are primarily physicians and other healthcare providers 
use of our products would be adversely impacted if physicians do not receive adequate reimbursement for the cost of our products by their patients healthcare insurers or payers 
our net sales could also be adversely affected by changes or trends in reimbursement policies of these governmental or private healthcare payers 
in the us  healthcare providers such as hospitals and physicians who purchase diagnostic products generally rely on third party payers  principally private health insurance plans  federal medicare and state medicaid  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure 
we believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to  and will continue to lead to  increased pressures on the healthcare industry  both foreign and domestic  to reduce the cost of products and services 
given the efforts to control and reduce healthcare costs in the us in recent years  currently available levels of reimbursement may not continue to be available in the future for our existing products or products under development 
third party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or adequate in either us or foreign markets  current reimbursement amounts may be decreased in the future and future legislation  regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payers may reduce the demand for our products or adversely impact our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 
unexpected increases in  or inability to meet  current demand for our products could require us to spend considerable resources to meet the demand or harm our customer relationships if we are unable to meet demand 
if we experience unexpected increases in the demand for our products  we may be required to expend additional capital resources to meet these demands 
these capital resources could involve the cost of new machinery or even the cost of new manufacturing facilities 
this would increase our capital costs  which could adversely affect our earnings and cash resources 
if we are unable to develop necessary manufacturing capabilities in a timely manner  our net sales could be adversely affected 
failure to cost effectively increase production volumes  if required  or lower than anticipated yields or production problems encountered as a result of changes that we may make in our manufacturing processes to meet increased demand or changes in applicable laws and regulations  could result in shipment delays as well as increased manufacturing costs  which could also have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability 
unexpected increases in demand for our products could also require us to obtain additional raw materials in order to manufacture products to meet the demand 
some raw materials require significant ordering lead time and some are currently obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
we have long term supply agreements with many of these suppliers  but these long term agreements involve risks for us  such as our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of raw materials and components and our reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery 
it is also possible that one or more of these suppliers may become unwilling or unable to deliver materials to us 
any shortfall in our supply of raw materials and components  and our inability to obtain alternative sources for this supply  could have a material adverse effect on our net sales or cost of sales and related profits 
our inability to meet customer demand for our products  whether as a result of manufacturing problems or supply shortfalls  could harm our customer relationships and impair our reputation within the industry 
this  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if one or more of our products proves to be defective  we could be subject to claims of liability that could adversely affect our business 
a defect in the design or manufacture of our products could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and subject us to claims of liability for injuries and otherwise 
any substantial underinsured loss resulting from such a claim would have a material adverse effect on our profitability and the damage to our reputation in the industry could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are exposed to business risk which  if not covered by insurance  could have an adverse effect on our profits 
claims may be made against us for types of damages  or for amounts of damages  that are not covered by our insurance 
for example  although we currently carry product liability insurance for liability losses  there is a risk that product liability or other claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of our policy 
also  if we are held liable  our existing insurance may not be renewed at the same cost and level of coverage as currently in effect  or may not be renewed at all 
if we are held liable for a claim against which we are not insured or for damages exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage  whether arising out of product liability matters or from some other matter  that claim could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability 
if we are not able to manage our growth strategy and if we experience difficulties integrating companies or technologies we may acquire after the acquisition  our earnings may be adversely affected 
our business strategy contemplates further growth in the scope of operating and financial systems and the area of our operations  including further expansion outside the us  as new products are developed and commercialized 
we may experience difficulties integrating our own operations with those of companies or technologies that we may acquire  and as a result we may not realize our anticipated benefits and cost savings within our expected time frame  or at all 
because we have a relatively small executive staff  future growth may also divert management s attention from other aspects of our business  and will place a strain on existing management and our operational  financial and management information systems 
furthermore  we may expand into markets in which we have less experience or incur higher costs 
should we encounter difficulties in managing these tasks  our growth strategy may suffer and our net sales and gross profits could be adversely affected 
our business could be negatively affected by the loss of or the inability to hire key personnel 
our future success depends in part on our ability to retain our key technical  sales  marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify and hire additional qualified personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  both in the industry in which we operate and also in santa clara and san diego  where our headquarters and the majority of our operations are located 
further  we expect to grow our operations  and our needs for additional management and other key personnel are expected to increase 
if we are not able to retain existing key personnel  or identify and hire additional qualified personnel to meet expected growth  our business could be adversely impacted 
we face risks relating to our international sales  including inherent economic  political and regulatory risks  which could increase our costs  cause interruptions in our current business operations and or stifle our growth opportunities 
our products are sold internationally  primarily to our customers in japan and europe 
we currently sell and market our products by channeling products through distributor organizations and sales agents 
sales to foreign customers accounted for  and of our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
international sales are subject to inherent economic  political and regulatory risks  which could increase our operating costs  cause interruptions in our current business operations and impede our international growth 
these foreign risks include  among others compliance with new and changing registration requirements  our inability to benefit from registration for our product  inasmuch as registration may be controlled by a distributor  and tariffs or other barriers as we continue to expand into new countries and geographic regions  exposure to currency exchange fluctuations  such as the and decrease in value of the euro and yen  respectively  against the us dollar for the year ended december   longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  reduced protection for  and enforcement of  intellectual property rights  political and economic instability in some of the regions where we currently sell our products or that we may expand into in the future  potentially adverse tax consequences  and diversion of our products to the us from products sold into international markets at lower prices 
currently  all of our international sales are negotiated for and paid in us dollars 
nonetheless  these sales are subject to currency risks  since changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive 
these exchange rate fluctuations could negatively impact international sales of our products and our anticipated foreign operations  as could changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
in order to maintain a competitive price for our products in europe and japan  we may have to continue to provide discounts or otherwise effectively reduce our prices  resulting in a lower margin on products sold in these geographical territories 
continued change in the values of the euro  the japanese yen and other foreign currencies could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not currently hedge against exchange rate fluctuations  which means that we will be fully exposed to exchange rate changes 
investor confidence and share value may be adversely impacted if we and or our independent registered public accounting firm conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective 
as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the sec adopted rules requiring us  as a public company  to include a report of management on our internal controls over financial reporting in our annual reports on form k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on management s assessment as well as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
how companies are implementing these requirements  including internal control reforms  if any  to comply with section s requirements  and how independent registered public accounting firms are applying these requirements and testing companies internal controls  remain subject to uncertainty 
the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of are ongoing 
we expect that our internal controls will continue to evolve as our business activities change 
although we seek to diligently and vigorously review our internal controls over financial reporting in an effort to ensure compliance with the section requirements  any control system  regardless of how well designed  operated and evaluated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that its objectives will be met 
if  during any year  our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal controls over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented  designed  operated  tested or assessed  or if the independent registered public accounting firm interprets the requirements  rules or regulations differently than we do  then it may decline to attest to management s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and effectiveness of our internal controls  which ultimately could negatively impact the market price of our shares 
risks related to our common stock our stock price has been highly volatile  and an investment in our stock could suffer a significant decline in value 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and has fluctuated substantially in the past 
for example  between december  and december   the closing price of our common stock  as reported by the nasdaq global market  has ranged from a low of to a high of 
we expect our common stock to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including seasonal fluctuations in our sales of group a strep and influenza tests  which are generally highest in fall and winter  thus resulting in generally lower operating results in the second and third calendar quarters and higher operating results in the first and fourth calendar quarters  media attention focused on a potential influenza pandemic and the related potential impact on humans from avian flu  as well as the uncertainty surrounding the detection of novel influenza viruses in human specimens  changes in the level of competition  such as would occur if one of our larger and better financed competitors introduced a new and superior technology or a lower priced product to compete with one of our products  changes in economic conditions in our domestic and international markets  such as economic downturns  reduced consumer demand  inflation and currency fluctuations  particularly as we expand into markets outside japan and western europe where economic conditions may differ from those prevailing at given times among developed nations  changes in sales levels  since a significant portion of our costs are fixed costs with the result that relatively higher sales could likely increase profitability but relatively lower sales would not reduce costs by the same proportion  and hence could cause operating losses  declines in orders from major distributors as a result of lower than expected end user demand  whether as a result of a light cold and flu season or otherwise  lower than anticipated sales of our new products  our failure to achieve  or changes in  financial estimates by securities analysts and comments or opinions about us by securities analysts or major stockholders  additions or departures of our key personnel  litigation or threat of litigation  sales of our common stock and limited daily trading volume  and economic and other external factors  disasters or crises 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq global market and the market for technology companies in particular  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that  at times  have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the relevant companies 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted 
a securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs  potential liabilities and the diversion of management s attention and resources 
future sales by existing stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock 
sales of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
as of december  approximately million shares of our common stock had been issued in registered offerings and million are freely tradable in the public markets  and approximately million shares of our common stock were issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options under our various equity incentive plans at a weighted average exercise price of  for stock options 
we are unable to estimate the number of shares of our common stock that may actually be resold in the public market since this will depend on the market price for our common stock  the individual circumstances of the sellers and other factors 
we also have a number of institutional stockholders that own significant blocks of our common stock 
if one or more of these stockholders were to sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time  for liquidity or other reasons  the prevailing market price of our common stock could be negatively affected 
anti takeover devices may prevent a sale  or changes in the management  of the company 
we have in place several anti takeover devices  including a stockholder rights plan  that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a sale  or changes in the management  of the company 
for example  our bylaws require stockholders to give written notice of any proposal or director nomination to us within a specified period of time prior to any stockholder meeting 
we may also issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and on terms that our board of directors may determine in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock  and the holders of such preferred stock could have voting  dividend  liquidation and other rights superior to those of holders of our common stock 
we do not pay dividends and this may negatively affect the price of our stock 
we have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
the future price of our common stock may be adversely impacted because we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties our executive  administrative  manufacturing and research and development operation is located in san diego  california where we lease a  square foot facility 
the san diego lease expires in with options to extend the lease for two additional five year periods 
in addition  we lease approximately  square feet of manufacturing  laboratory and office space in santa clara  california 
the santa clara lease expires in we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs  and we currently do not anticipate any material difficulty in renewing any of our leases as they expire or securing additional or replacement facilities  in each case  on commercially reasonable terms 
however  in anticipation of our growth strategy  we may pursue alternative facilities

executive summary we have a leadership position in the development  manufacturing and marketing of rapid diagnostic solutions at the point of care poc in infectious diseases and reproductive health 
we focus on poc testing solutions specifically developed for the physician office lab and acute care markets globally 
we primarily earn revenue from sales of products for use in physician offices  hospitals  clinical laboratories and wellness screening centers 
we market our products in the us through a network of national and regional distributors  supported by a direct sales force 
internationally  we sell and market primarily in japan and europe by channeling products through distributor organizations and sales agents 
we derive a majority of our net sales from three product lines 
for the years ended december   and  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our net sales from sales of our influenza  pregnancy and group a strep tests 
in the us  we lead the professional market in these three product categories with an estimated   and market share in influenza  pregnancy and group a strep products  respectively  as of december  the market share data is estimated based on trailing twelve month sales from distribution to end use customers 
additionally  a significant portion of our net sales are from a relatively small number of distributors 
approximately  and of our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively  were related to sales through our four largest distributors in each of those periods 
we also develop research products through our spg with an emphasis on potential future rapid test applications 
the spg is currently responsible for more than of our clinical and research products used worldwide in reference laboratories and in research applications at leading universities and biotechnology companies 
the spg revenues  earnings and assets are less than of our overall operations 
our product sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this was largely driven by increased domestic sales of our influenza and group a strep tests as we continued to focus our efforts to strengthen market and brand leadership in infectious disease and reproductive health by delivering economic and clinical proof through our efforts with our quidel value build qvb program 
our poc testing solutions are designed to provide specialized results that meet two important value criteria that we have branded as qvb clinical validation the enabling of rapid patient management decisions leading to improved treatment and outcomes 
economic validation the reduction of overall costs associated with patient testing with emphasis upon critical reimbursement and payer performance criteria 
we focus on ensuring market leadership and providing points of differentiation by specializing in the diagnosis and monitoring of selected disease states 
in order to support our value proposition as a company that markets the highest quality products in support of better medical outcomes  we are highlighting our qvb through the development of new innovations and the communication of new solutions in the field of rapid diagnostic testing 
our qvb includes significant work in understanding the needs of the end use customer  building products that meet those needs  providing proof studies to validate rapid diagnostic testing at the point of care and leveraging the work of researchers and key opinion leaders studying our tests and technology to help enhance the health and well being of people around the globe 
our marketing strategy includes ensuring each of our key product portfolios is supported by economic and clinical validation that shows hospitals  acute care facilities and poc clinicians that these tests deliver high quality results in a cost effective manner 
we believe that the trend among healthcare providers to adopt poc testing continues to increase  and demographic changes  reimbursement policies  a shortage of skilled laboratory workers and the availability of clinically valuable tests will increase growth in this diagnostic category 
more and more employers  health plans and payers are recognizing that poc testing is a cost effective means for improving the quality of care and patient satisfaction 
continuous improvements in technologies are resulting in a growing number of new diagnostic tests that combine high levels of accuracy with rapid  easy to use product formats 
it is our mission to further establish our significant leadership position in poc rapid diagnostics 
in order to accomplish this mission  our strategy is to provide clinicians with validated  value based proof which encompasses the clinical efficacy and economic efficiency of our rapid poc tests for the professional market  pursue over the counter opportunities with strategic partners  strengthen market and brand leadership in infectious disease and reproductive health  drive growth by establishing dedicated distributor partnerships and expanding our sales organization  drive profit through further refinement of industry leading manufacturing efficiencies  continue to focus our research and development efforts on three areas new proprietary product platform development  the creation of improved products and new products for existing markets  and products developed under collaborations with other companies for new and existing markets  develop and maintain key relationships with third parties and cooperative collaborations  identify and commercialize new markers  products and collaborations in bone health through our spg  and pursue licensing  acquisition and partnership opportunities that meet our dedicated focus on research to rapids 
as a business in a highly regulated and competitive industry  we face many risks and challenges and we also have opportunities 
there are many economic and industry factors that affect our business  some of the more important factors are outlined below sales of our products can be affected significantly by many competitive factors  including convenience  price and product performance as well as the distribution  advertising  promotion and brand name recognition of the marketer  intellectual property protection of our products is crucial to our business  the testing  manufacture and commercialization of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities  principally the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies  the production processes for poc tests are complex  highly regulated and vary widely from product to product  to successfully compete for business in our industry  we believe our poc testing solutions must be designed to provide specific results for clinical and economic validation  there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets over the last few years  and sales of our group a strep and influenza products  which have collectively accounted for approximately  and of net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively  are subject to  and significantly affected by  the seasonal demands of the cold and flu seasons 
during the fourth quarter of  we launched our quickvue rsv test upon receiving clearance from the fda 
our quickvue rsv test allows for the rapid  qualitative detection of respiratory syncytial virus directly from nasopharyngeal swab and nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens 
this test is intended for use as an aid in the rapid diagnosis of acute rsv viral infections 
rsv infection is recognized as the leading cause of hospitalization of children during the first year of life 
it is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and small children under two years old  increases an infant s risk of getting an ear infection and may exacerbate asthma or other chronic lung conditions in both children and adults 
with seasonality from late fall into the spring and many symptoms similar to those of the common cold and flu  rsv often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed  thus increasing the risk of serious health complications 
in clinical studies with nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens  our quickvue rsv test correctly identified of the patients infected with rsv and of patients as negative for rsv when compared to cell culture  as well as clinical sensitivity and specificity when using nasopharyngeal swab specimens 
after the initial year of introduction  our quickvue ifob test is gaining momentum 
our test is intended to detect the presence of human blood in stool specimens 
blood in the stool is an indication of a number of gastrointestinal conditions including colorectal cancer 
in the fob market  we have seen an increase in the conversion of guaiac based fob tests to the newer immunochemical fob tests 
the quickvue brand has made progress in three major segments the physician s office  the acute care and reference labs 
special packaging has been designed and implemented to meet the specific needs of each customer segment 
investment continues in clinical proof as part of our qvb program as well as increased educational efforts to further the conversion by health care professionals 
we believe the potential domestic market opportunity is approximately million tests 
in december  we secured an exclusive license for the molecular diagnostic technology in the mchip a microarray technology for flu  developed to detect  type and subtype interpandemic influenza viruses  such as hn and hn  and avian influenza viruses  such as hn the mchip technology may be used in conjunction with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt pcr to detect  type and subtype specific influenza viruses 
the microarray technology is multiplex in nature allowing detection of a broad spectrum of influenza subtypes 
we are currently working on the development of our phase i product targeted for use in influenza surveillance 
we entered into an agreement with a third party during the fourth quarter of whereby we obtained a sublicense to certain lateral flow technology 
per the terms of the sublicense agreement  we made a one time payment of million as consideration for the fully paid up license  and the amount will be amortized ratably through the expiration of the applicable patents in december outlook for fiscal year  we anticipate continued year over year revenue growth in our core products and from new product launches 
we believe gross margins will continue to be positively affected by a more favorable product and geographical mix  as well as increased average selling prices and volumes  partially offset by increased strategic investments in our operational infrastructure 
according to data from the centers for disease control and prevention  current influenza incidence appears to be above the baseline and has been trending upward 
we believe we are appropriately staged for the remaining influenza demand for this season 
revenues from our ifob test continue to increase quarter over quarter 
we expect a gradual conversion of the fecal occult blood test market from the current guaiac based test to an immunochemical based test 
successful conversion of this market requires changing physician behavior through education  focused on clinical and economic validation 
additionally  we expect our recently launched rsv product to be a well received companion test to our quickvue influenza a b test so that physicians are well prepared to diagnose and appropriately manage patients with influenza and or rsv 
we anticipate continued investment spending in marketing and clinical trials in support of our new product launches and to further validate the clinical efficacy and economic efficiency of our existing products  primarily influenza 
we continue to conduct internal and external validations of our tests as compared to several domestic and international competitive tests 
we anticipate having results of these studies presented and published in several venues in and we also plan to make significant investments in our sales force to further support our leadership position and allow us to take advantage of the large opportunities in poc diagnostics 
we expect research and development expense to continue to increase as we expand our capabilities to accelerate innovation and invest in research and development of new technologies 
you should also refer to the discussion in item a  risk factors in part i of this annual report for further discussion of risks related to our business 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues consolidated statements of operations data year ended december  revenues net sales research contracts  licenses and royalties total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales research and development sales and marketing general and administrative patent litigation settlement amortization of intangibles total costs and expenses operating earnings loss other income expense interest income interest expense other income total other income expense earnings loss from continuing operations before benefit provision for income taxes benefit provision for income taxes earnings loss from continuing operations gain loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes net earnings loss net sales net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was largely driven by an increase in sales of our influenza and group a strep products of million and million  respectively 
the overall increase was partially offset by a decrease of our influenza product revenues in our japanese market 
for the year ended december   we believe revenue to these products has continued to increase due to successes related to our qvb programs  which have resulted in strengthened customer relationships and preferred partnership programs 
we believe that sales of our influenza products continue to increase as a result of increased market awareness and the demonstrated quality of our test 
we believe our average selling price in the us has continued to increase largely as a result of our clinical proof claims and product quality  while we have experienced downward pressure in the japanese market as a result of reimbursement changes and increased competition 
the increase in our group a strep product revenues was primarily related to the us and japanese markets and driven by both increased volume and higher average selling prices 
as of december   our us professional market share is an estimated and for our influenza and group a strep products  respectively  and we are the market leader in both 
the market share data is estimated based on trailing twelve month sales from distribution to end use customers 
these two product lines collectively accounted for  and of our net sales for the years ended december   and net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was largely driven by an increase in sales of our influenza  group a strep and pregnancy products of million  million and million  respectively 
the overall increases were partially offset by declines in our pregnancy and group a strep products in certain international markets 
these three product lines collectively accounted for of our net sales for the year ended december  the increase in sales of our influenza products in was primarily due to the domestic launch of our new influenza a b product  timing of the domestic influenza season and increased sales into the japanese market 
for the year ended december   we experienced decreased sales of our influenza products in japan due to a weak flu season  which ended abruptly in the early part of the first quarter of and resulted in significant quantities of our influenza a b product remaining in our japanese distribution channel 
as a result  our sales were adversely and materially affected during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of according to information provided by our japanese distributor  significant quantities of our influenza product previously existing in our japanese distribution channel were significantly reduced as of our third quarter of  which resulted in increased sales in japan for the year ended december  the increase in sales of our pregnancy products for the year ended december  was primarily related to increased domestic sales  partially offset by decreased international revenues related to the elimination of lower margin sales in underdeveloped markets as part of the realignment of our global distribution network 
we believe the increase in our group a strep product sales for the year ended december  was primarily due to a drop off in orders for group a strep test products for the year ended december  resulting from us distributor confusion or concern created by the then ongoing intellectual property litigation with ima initiated during that period 
additionally  during the quarter ended march   we implemented a price increase in our group a strep products 
research contracts  license fees and royalty income research contracts  license fees and royalty income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease for the year ended december  was primarily related to research contract revenue that we earned during the year ended december  in connection with achieving certain milestones under a joint development agreement with another company 
during the second quarter of  the joint development agreement was terminated 
the balance of this revenue for all periods primarily relates to royalty payments earned on patented technologies of ours utilized by third parties 
research contracts  license fees and royalty income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during  we entered into a joint development agreement with another company and earned million of research contract revenue in connection with achieving certain milestones under a joint development agreement 
in connection with this agreement  we received certain upfront non refundable fees  which had been recorded as deferred revenue and included in other accrued liabilities in our balance sheet as of december  during the second quarter of  the joint development agreement was terminated and the remaining deferred revenue balance of million was recognized as contract revenue 
the balance of this revenue for all periods primarily relates to royalty payments earned on patented technologies of ours utilized by third parties 
cost of sales and gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross profit from net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the royalty we began paying on the majority of our products during the second quarter of related to the patent litigation settlement with ima  and strategic investments in our operational infrastructure  partially offset by a more favorable product and geographic mix  higher unit volume and increased average selling prices 
in connection with the patent litigation settlement entered into during the second quarter of  we are required  as of may  to pay an royalty on net sales of our current influenza  group a strep  pregnancy  h 
pylori  mononucleosis  chlamydia  ifob  rsv and veterinary products 
these product sales accounted for  and of our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
royalty expense related to this settlement agreement was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
if the ima royalty had been paid for the full year  the royalty expense would have been million 
also for the year ended december   the gross profit as a percentage of sales was favorably impacted compared to as we fulfilled the terms of an agreement with another party related to the development of our influenza product during the first quarter of we are no longer required to pay to this party a royalty on sales of our influenza product 
our influenza products sales accounted for  and of our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
gross profit from net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the percentage and dollar increase was primarily due to increased sales volume  a more favorable mix related to our influenza products and a decrease in royalties relating to a third party patent which expired in as well as termination of certain other royalty obligations on our influenza product 
the license agreement which expired in required us to pay royalties ranging from to on domestic sales of our influenza  group a strep  pregnancy  h 
pylori  mononucleosis  chlamydia and veterinary products 
as a result  our royalty expense was favorably impacted by million and million for the years ended december  and   respectively 
this increase in gross profit was partially offset by the royalty we began paying on the majority of our products during the second quarter of related to the patent litigation settlement with ima 
research and development expense research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  research and development expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to of net sales for the year ended december   as compared to of net sales for the year ended december  the primary components of this expense are personnel and material costs associated with development of potential new technologies and processes and with products under development 
in addition  we continue to incur substantial costs related to clinical trials as well as our overall effort under our qvb programs 
research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  research and development expense as a percentage of net sales remained constant at of net sales for the year ended december  and the absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to increased personnel related costs  material costs and consulting fees related to our ltf technology platform  and to a lesser extent  clinical trials in support of our qvb programs 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in patent related expenses during due to the litigation settlement 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote a significant amount of financial resources to research and development for the foreseeable future 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december   from of net sales for the year ended december  the primary components of this expense relate to continued investment in assessing future product extensions and enhancements  market research including voice of customer surveys  programs aimed at distribution partners and end user customers and reimbursement related activities and product shipment costs 
we also increased our sales force to further support our leadership position and seek to take advantage of further opportunities in poc diagnostics 
sales and marketing expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales remained constant at for the years ended december  and the absolute dollar increase relates primarily to increased personnel related costs  marketing programs and events to support our focused efforts on our qvb program and reinforcing relationships with key distributors 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from of net sales for the year ended december  the absolute dollar decrease for the year ended december  was primarily due to decreased legal fees of million associated primarily with the settlement of our intellectual property litigation with ima during  partially offset by increases in personnel costs associated with stock based compensation and management incentive plans of million 
general and administrative expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the absolute dollar decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in legal fees associated with the settlement of our intellectual property litigation  partially offset by million of personnel costs associated with restricted stock compensation expense and management incentives  as well as million related to the ceo changes in patent litigation settlement as previously disclosed  during the second quarter of we entered into an agreement to settle certain patent litigation with ima and recorded a charge of million in the first quarter of  which amount was paid in april amortization of intangibles we completed our annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill as of december  and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed 
a significant decline in our projected revenue or earnings growth or cash flows  a significant decline in our stock price or the stock price of comparable companies  loss of legal ownership or title to an asset and any significant change in our strategic business objectives and utilization of our assets are among many factors that could result in an impairment charge that could have a material negative impact on our operating results 
our other intangible assets  which are being amortized over a period of two to years  include purchased technology  license agreements  patents  trademarks and a favorable lease 
amortization expense was million  million and million for each of the years ended december   and the increase for the year ended december  was primarily due to the amortization of intellectual property related to two license agreements entered into during late and an additional license agreement entered into during late other income expense interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and relates primarily to interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents balance 
interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and relates to interest paid on obligations under capital leases  which are primarily related to our san diego facility 
other income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  we recognized non cash income of approximately million associated with certain remaining balance sheet credits of a foreign entity which was previously closed 
income taxes we recorded a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  versus a tax provision of million for the year ended december  this change is due primarily to a decrease in the deferred tax valuation allowance during the fourth quarter ended december  and recognizes the deferred tax asset amount considered by management  more likely than not  to be realized 
the tax expense for the year ended december  was largely due to a partial valuation allowance we established at march  totaling million for a portion of our deferred tax assets 
this was primarily as a result of our patent litigation settlement of million recorded during the first quarter of and the expected effect of future royalty payments under the settlement agreement 
due to the impact of this settlement  we reassessed the realizability of our deferred tax assets  which have been recognized primarily based on projected earnings 
as a result of revisions to our estimates of projected earnings  related primarily to the effect of the million settlement payment and future royalty payments  partially offset by a projected reduction in future litigation expenses  we concluded that we could not support the recognition of the same level of deferred tax assets that we had reported on our balance sheet as of december  gain loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes in the accompanying financial statement  our urinalysis and ultrasonometer businesses are reported as discontinued operations under sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we discontinued all operations of our ultrasonometer business during the fourth quarter of during the second quarter of  we sold certain assets of our urinalysis business for million 
accordingly  the operations of both businesses have been classified as discontinued operations in the statements of operations for all periods presented 
during the fourth quarter of  we finalized our open tax audits in germany and recognized a non cash gain on discontinued operations of approximately million associated with certain remaining balance sheet credits related to the urinalysis operation sold during the loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal source of liquidity consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents 
our working capital as of december  was million 
our earnings from continuing operations provided net cash of million for the year ended december  we had net earnings of million and million of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets and million of non cash stock compensation expense 
we experienced a decrease in accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable of million  million and million  respectively  for the year ended december   due primarily to seasonal demand fluctuations of our influenza and group a strep products 
other changes in liabilities included a decrease in other current liabilities of million as of december  related primarily to fulfillment of contractual obligations associated with the acquisition of our ifob test 
our investing activities used million of cash during the year ended december   primarily driven by the acquisition of manufacturing equipment  building improvements and the acquisition of a license agreement related to certain intellectual property 
our financing activities used million of cash during the year ended december  and were related primarily to the repurchase of million of our common stock and million for payments on obligations under our capital leases related to our building in san diego 
these items were partially offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plans 
in march  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional million in shares of our common stock under our previously announced share repurchase program 
see note subsequent events in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we are planning approximately million in capital expenditures for the primary purpose for our capital expenditures is to acquire manufacturing equipment  implement facility expansion and improvements and for information technology 
we plan to fund these capital expenditures with cash flow from operations 
we do not have any firm purchase commitments with respect to such planned expenditures as of the date of filing this annual report 
we currently have a million credit facility the senior secured credit facility  which has a three and a half year term  maturing on june  the senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and bears interest at a rate ranging from to plus the lender s prime rate or  at our option  a rate ranging from to plus the london interbank offering rate 
the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility also contains certain customary covenants restricting our ability to  among other matters  incur additional indebtedness  create liens or other encumbrances  pay dividends or make other restricted payments  make investments  loans and guarantees or sell or otherwise dispose of a substantial portion of assets to  or merge or consolidate with  another entity 
the terms of the senior secured credit facility require us to comply with certain financial covenants  including a minimum net worth  a maximum ratio of debt drawn under the senior secured credit facility to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  a fixed charge coverage ratio  and minimum ebitda 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the senior secured credit facility and we were in material compliance with all covenants 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
contractual obligations our facilities and certain equipment are leased under noncancelable capital and operating leases 
we also have obligations and commitments related to an asset purchase and licensing agreement 
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations in thousands payment due by period total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations asset purchase and license agreement total reflects obligations on facilities and equipment under capital leases  including current maturities  in place as of december  future minimum lease payments are included in the table above 
reflects obligations on facilities and equipment under operating leases in place as of december  future minimum lease payments are included in the table above 
reflects obligations resulting from firm purchase commitments for inventory components of million 
we have entered into various licensing agreements  which require royalty payments based on specified product sales 
these agreements  which have anticipated expiration dates through  encompass the majority of our products 
royalty expenses under these licensing agreements  which are charged to cost of sales  collectively totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we believe we will continue to incur substantial royalty expenses relating to future sales of our products 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements stock based compensation prior to december   we accounted for our share based employee and director compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we recorded no share based employee and director compensation expense for options granted under our equity incentive plan or its predecessor plans prior to december   as all options granted under those plans had exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we did not have material compensation expense in connection with our employee stock purchase plan 
in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we disclosed our net earnings loss and net earnings loss per share as if we had applied the fair value based method in measuring compensation expense for our share based incentive programs 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes a compensation expense for all share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation expense for all share based awards granted on or after january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
the computation of the expected option life is based on a weighted average calculation combining the average life of options that have already been exercised and post vest cancellations with the estimated life of the remaining vested and unexercised options 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
the risk free interest rate is based on the u 
s treasury yield curve over the expected term of the option 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
the estimated forfeiture rate is based on our historical experience 
compensation expense related to stock options granted is recognized ratably over the service vesting period for the entire option award 
the total number of stock options expected to vest is adjusted by estimated forfeiture rates 
the estimated fair value of each stock option was determined on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards stock awards is measured at the grant date and recognized ratably over the vesting period 
the fair value of stock awards is determined based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date 
the total amount of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock awards as of december  was approximately million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
for stock awards granted prior to december   vesting is based on both the service period as well as the achievement of our performance goals 
meeting the performance goals for these awards allows for acceleration of a portion of the stock awards 
a majority of the stock awards granted in march were performance based and vesting is tied to achievement of our goals 
for purposes of measuring compensation expense  the amount of shares ultimately expected to vest is estimated at each reporting date based on management s expectations regarding the relevant performance criteria 
a significant portion of our stock grants contains performance based criteria 
the recognition of compensation expense associated with performance based grants requires judgment in assessing the probability of meeting the performance goals  as well as defined criteria for assessing achievement of the performance related goals 
the grant date of the performance based stock grants takes place when the grant is authorized and the specific achievement goals are communicated 
the communication date of the performance goals can impact the valuation and associated expense of the stock grant 
this may result in significant expense recognition in the period in which the performance goals are met or when achievement of the goals is deemed probable 
revenue recognition we record revenues primarily from product sales 
these revenues are recorded net of rebates and other discounts which are estimated at the time of sale 
the rebates and other discounts are largely driven by various customer program offerings  including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
revenue from product sales is recorded upon passage of title and risk of loss to the customer 
change in title to the product and recognition of revenue occur upon delivery to the customer when sales terms are fob destination and at the time of shipment when the sales terms are fob shipping point and there is no right of return 
we also earn income from the licensing of technology and have previously earned income from performing services under a joint development agreement 
royalty income from the grant of license rights is recognized during the period in which the revenue is earned and the amount is determinable from the licensee 
milestone payments  arising under joint development agreements  were previously recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgment from the collaborator or other persuasive evidence that the milestone had been achieved  provided that i the milestone event was substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii our performance obligations after the milestone achievement would continue to be funded by the collaborator at a level comparable to before the milestone achievement 
if both of these criteria were not met  the milestone payment would be recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement 
income earned from licensing activities is classified under revenues as research contracts  license fees and royalty income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable  our history of bad debts  and the general condition of the industry 
if a major customer s credit worthiness deteriorates  or our customers actual defaults exceed our historical experience  our estimates could change and adversely impact our reported results 
inventory our policy is to value inventories at the lower of cost or market on a part by part basis 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventories  including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventories 
we determine excess and obsolete inventories based on an estimate of the future demand for our products within a specified time horizon  generally twelve months 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
if our demand forecast is greater than our actual demand  we may be required to take additional excess inventory charges  which would decrease gross margin and adversely impact net operating results in the future 
intangibles intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on the expected number of years the asset will generate revenue or otherwise be used by us 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
examples of such events or circumstances include the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  any volatility or significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization compared to our net book value  loss of legal ownership or title to an asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of our assets  and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  impairment is tested by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the fair value of the reporting unit to which the asset is assigned 
for goodwill  a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill 
sfas no 
requires periodic evaluations for impairment of goodwill balances 
we completed our annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill as of december  and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed 
income taxes a valuation allowance of million had been established against a portion of the our deferred tax assets at december  as of december   we believed it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize our deferred tax asset through expected future taxable profits  and released a valuation allowance of approximately million of which million was recognized as an income tax benefit and million reduced the existing value of goodwill 
although realization is not assured  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets at december  for which a valuation allowance was determined to be unnecessary will be realized in the ordinary course of operations based on the available positive and negative evidence  primarily our projected earnings 
the amount of the net deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if actual future earnings or income tax rates are lower than estimated  or if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing taxable or deductible temporary differences 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r we will recognize excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
accordingly  deferred tax assets are not recognized for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from excess tax benefits 
as of december  and  deferred tax assets do not include million and million  respectively of these excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises that are a component of our net operating loss carryforwards 
deferred taxes and the valuation allowance as of december  have been restated in order to conform to the presentation 
additional paid in capital will be increased up to million if such excess tax benefits are realized 
we will continue to assess the assumptions used to determine the valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the other components of the deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period such determination were made 
conversely  if based on estimates of future earnings  we determined that all or a portion of the valuation allowance is no longer warranted  a reduction in the valuation would result in a corresponding credit to additional paid in capital and or income tax expense in the period such determination were made 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
 which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions  as defined 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin no 
will be reported as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of fin no 
will have  if any  on our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with earlier application encouraged 
any amounts recognized upon adoption as a cumulative effect adjustment will be recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
we have not yet determined the impact of sfas no 
on our financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the fair market value of our floating interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of floating interest rate debt will vary as interest rates increase or decrease 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  based on our market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at december  and  we have determined that there was no material market risk exposure to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of such dates 
our current investment policy with respect to our cash and cash equivalents focuses on maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk and liquidity 
although we continually evaluate our placement of investments  as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were placed in money market and or overnight funds that are highly liquid and which we believe are not subject to material market fluctuation risk 
foreign currency exchange risk all of our international sales are negotiated for and paid in us dollars 
nonetheless  these sales are subject to currency risks  since changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive 
these exchange rate fluctuations could negatively impact international sales of our products and our anticipated foreign operations  as could changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
continued change in the values of the euro  the japanese yen and other foreign currencies could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not currently hedge against exchange rate fluctuations  which means that we will be fully exposed to exchange rate changes
