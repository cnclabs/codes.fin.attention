table of contents item a 
risk factors the company s business is subject to a variety of risks 
the risk factors detailed below should be considered in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report on form k 
if any of these risks actually materialize  the company s business  financial condition  and future prospects could be negatively impacted 
these risks are not the only ones the company faces 
there may be additional risks that are presently unknown to the company or that it currently believes to be immaterial that could affect its business 
the company may lose market share due to competition  which would decrease future sales and earnings 
the furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with many domestic and foreign manufacturers 
some competitors have greater financial resources than the company and often offer extensively advertised  well recognized  branded products 
competition from foreign producers has increased dramatically in the past few years 
the company may not be able to change the prices of its products in response to these competitive pressures or increasing supplier and production costs 
also  due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings  the company may not be able to continue to differentiate its products through styling  finish and other construction techniques from those of its competitors 
in addition  large retail furniture dealers have the ability and could at any time begin to obtain offshore sourcing on their own 
as a result  the company is continually subject to the risk of losing market share  which may lower sales and earnings 
an economic downturn could result in a decrease in sales and earnings 
the furniture industry is subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects 
economic downturns could affect consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for home furnishings 
these events could also impact retailers  the company s primary customers  possibly resulting in a decrease in the company s sales and earnings 
changes in interest rates  consumer confidence  new housing starts  existing home sales  and geopolitical factors are particularly significant economic indicators for the company 
failure to anticipate or timely respond to changes in fashion and consumer tastes could adversely impact the company s business and decrease sales and earnings 
furniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer tastes 
if the company fails to anticipate or timely respond to these changes it may lose market share or be faced with the decision of whether to sell excess inventory at reduced prices 
this could result in lower sales and earnings 
a loss of several large customers through business failures or other reasons could result in a decrease in future sales and earnings 
the loss of several of the company s major customers  through customer business failures or otherwise  could materially affect the sales and earnings of the company 
lost sales may be difficult to replace 
amounts owed to the company by a customer whose business fails may become uncollectible 
the company s ability to grow sales and earnings depends on the successful execution of its business strategies 
over the last five years  the company has transitioned from manufacturing most of its products to sourcing most of its products from offshore suppliers 
as a result  the company is now primarily a design  sourcing  marketing and logistics company 
the company s ability to maintain and grow sales and earnings depends on the continued correct selection and successful execution and refinement of its overall business strategies and business systems for designing  marketing  sourcing and distributing its products 
the company must also make good decisions about product mix 
since the company is exiting domestic manufacturing of wood furniture and is now completely dependent on offshore suppliers for wood furniture products  the company must continue to enhance relationships and business systems that allow it to continue to work more efficiently and effectively with its global sourcing suppliers 
the company also must continue to evaluate the appropriate mix between domestic manufacturing and foreign sourcing for upholstered products 
all of these factors affect the company s ability to grow sales and earnings 

table of contents the company depends on suppliers in china for a high proportion of its wood and metal furniture products  and a disruption in supply from china or from the company s most significant chinese supplier could adversely affect the company s ability to timely fill customer orders for these products and the costs of these products to the company 
in  imported products sourced from china accounted for approximately of the company s import purchases  and the factory in china from which the company directly sources the largest portion of its import products accounted for approximately of the company s worldwide purchases of imported products 
a sudden disruption in the company s supply chain from this factory  or from china in general  could significantly impact the company s ability to fill customer orders for products manufactured at that factory or in that country 
if such a disruption were to occur  the company believes that it would have sufficient inventory to adequately meet demand for approximately three months 
the company believes that it could  most likely at higher cost  source most of the products currently sourced in china from factories in other countries and could produce certain upholstered products domestically at its own factories 
however  supply disruptions and delays on selected items could occur for up to six months before remedial measures could be implemented 
if the company were to be unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources or at comparable cost  then a sudden disruption in the company s supply chain from its largest import furniture supplier  or from china in general  could have a short term material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
changes in the value of the us dollar compared to the currencies for the countries from which the company obtains its products could adversely affect net sales and profit margins 
for imported products  the company generally negotiates firm pricing with its foreign suppliers in us dollars for periods typically of up to one year 
the company accepts the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
since the company transacts its imported product purchases in us dollars  a relative decline in the value of the us dollar could increase the price the company must pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods 
these price changes could adversely impact net sales and profit margins during affected periods 
the company s dependence on offshore suppliers could  over time  adversely affect its ability to service customers  which could lower future sales and earnings 
the company has decided to completely exit domestic wood furniture manufacturing  effective at the end of march the company must now rely exclusively on offshore suppliers for its wood and metal furniture products 
the company s offshore suppliers may not supply goods that meet the company s quality  design or other specifications in a timely manner and at a competitive price 
if the company s suppliers do not meet the company s specifications  the company may need to find alternative vendors  potentially at a higher cost  or may be forced to discontinue products 
also  delivery of goods from offshore vendors may be delayed for reasons not typically encountered for domestically manufactured wood and metal furniture  such as shipment delays caused by customs or labor issues 
the company s failure to fill customer orders during an extended business interruption by a major offshore supplier could negatively impact existing customer relationships resulting in decreased sales and earnings 
because the company will rely on offshore sourcing for all of its wood and metal products  and for some of its upholstered products  it will be subject to changes in local government regulations  which could result in a decrease in earnings 
changes in political  economic  and social conditions  as well as laws and regulations in the foreign countries where the company sources its products could have adverse impacts on the company 
these changes could make it more difficult to provide products and service to the company s customers 
international trade policies of the united states and the countries where the company sources its finished products could adversely affect the company 
imposition of trade sanctions relating to imports  taxes  import duties and other charges on imports could increase the company s costs and decrease its earnings 
for example in  the us department of commerce imposed tariffs on wooden bedroom furniture coming into the united states from china 
in this case  none of the rates imposed were of sufficient magnitude to alter the company s import strategy in any meaningful way  however  these tariffs are subject to review and could be increased in the future 
the company may engage in acquisitions and investments in businesses  which could disrupt the company s business  dilute its earnings per share and decrease the value of its common stock 
the company may acquire or invest in businesses that offer complementary products and that the company believes offer competitive advantages 
however  the company may fail to identify significant liabilities or risks that negatively affect the company or results in the company paying more for the acquired company or assets than they are worth 
the company may also have difficulty assimilating the operations and personnel of an acquired business into the company s current operations 
acquisitions may disrupt the company s ongoing business or distract management from the company s ongoing business 
the company may pay for future acquisitions using cash  stock  the assumption of debt  or a combination thereof 
future acquisitions could result in dilution to existing shareholders and to earnings per share 

table of contents if demand for the company s domestically manufactured upholstered furniture declines and the company responds by realigning manufacturing  the company s near term earnings could decrease 
after march  the company s domestic manufacturing operations will consist solely of upholstered furniture 
a decline in demand for the company s domestically produced upholstered furniture could result in the realignment of domestic manufacturing operations and capabilities and the implementation of cost savings programs 
these programs could include the consolidation and integration of facilities  functions  systems and procedures 
the company may decide to source certain products from offshore suppliers  instead of continuing to manufacture them domestically 
these realignments and cost savings programs typically involve initial upfront costs and could result in decreases in the company s near term earnings before the expected cost reductions from realignment are realized 
the company may not always accomplish these actions as quickly as anticipated and may not fully achieve the expected cost reductions 
fluctuations in the price  availability and quality of raw materials for the company s domestically manufactured upholstered furniture could cause manufacturing delays  adversely affect the company s ability to provide goods to its customers and increase costs  any of which could decrease the company s sales and earnings 
the company uses various types of wood  leather  fabric  foam and other filling material  high carbon spring steel  bar and wire stock and other raw materials in manufacturing upholstered furniture 
the company depends on outside suppliers for raw materials and must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from these suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner 
the company does not have long term supply contracts with its suppliers 
unfavorable fluctuations in the price  quality and availability of required raw materials could negatively affect the company s ability to meet the demands of its customers 
the inability to meet customers demands could result in the loss of future sales 
the company may not always be able to pass along price increases in raw materials to its customers due to competitive and market pressures 
the company may experience impairment of its long lived assets  which would decrease earnings and net worth 
accounting rules require that long lived assets be tested for impairment at least annually 
the company has substantial long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  trademarks  trade names and goodwill  which based upon the outcome of the annual test  could result in the write down of all or a portion of these assets 
a write down of the company s assets would  in turn  reduce its earnings and net worth

overview over the five year period ended november   the company has operated in a sluggish economy impacted by low to moderate levels of consumer confidence and growing consumer preference for lower priced imported furniture products 
the company s results of operations have been affected in opposing ways by lower priced imported furniture 
first  the company s domestic wood furniture manufacturing operations have continued to suffer from lower demand and significant declines in volume for bedroom  home office  home entertainment and other products 
these declines led to the decision to close the company s last domestic wood manufacturing plant  located in martinsville  va

these sales gains were more than offset by a significant decline in shipments of the company s domestically produced wood furniture 
annual net sales by product category were as follows wood and metal furniture net sales declined by million  or  to million in versus million in domestic wood furniture net sales dropped to million in from million in  a decline of million  or  principally due to lower incoming order rates and more aggressive pricing and discounting

upholstered furniture net sales increased to of total net sales in from in management believes that net sales growth for hooker s imported wood and metal furniture was the result of stylish and innovative new furniture designs  groups and whole home collections such as preston ridge and intimate home  growth in container direct capabilities  orders and shipments resulting  in part  from the company s web based ordering system that provides retailers with the ability to more easily configure containers with a variety of products that are shipped from offshore facilities directly to the retailer  and 
table of contents investments in marketing media  advertising and retail support services and materials  including the introduction of smartliving store within a store galleries  and intimate home boutiques as well as the expansion of seven seas collection boutiques 
net sales growth for bradington young upholstered furniture operations was principally the result of sales of newly introduced products  including new leather and fabric products designed for hooker whole home collections  and sales growth in imported seven seas seating products  launched in the spring of  targeted at the medium and upper medium upholstery market niches  which represents a lower priced starting point for bradington young 
during  average selling prices declined compared to average selling prices declined for domestically produced wood furniture as a result of aggressive pricing  discounting and the mix of products shipped  and declined for upholstered products due to the mix of products shipped  including increased sales of lower priced imported upholstered furniture 
these declines more than offset increased average selling prices for imported wood and metal furniture resulting from the changing mix of products shipped 
gross profit margin declined to of net sales in compared to in  due to declining gross profit margin for both upholstered furniture and domestic wood furniture  partially offset by improved gross margin for imported wood and metal furniture 
the decline in demand for domestic wood furniture caused underutilization of the company s domestic production capacity  which in turn led to production inefficiencies resulting in increased labor and overhead costs as a percentage of net sales 
this coupled with aggressive pricing and promotional discounts  contributed to the decline in gross profit margin for domestic wood furniture 
the decline in gross profit margin for upholstered furniture resulted from the underutilization of domestic capacity in the second half of the year  higher employee benefits cost  principally for health insurance  and higher material costs  principally for foam 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million  or of net sales in from million  or of net sales in principally due to the following higher warehousing and distribution expenses resulting from increased demand for imports

environmental matters hooker furniture is committed to protecting the environment 
as a part of its business operations  the company s manufacturing sites generate non hazardous and hazardous wastes  the treatment  storage  transportation and disposal of which are subject to various local  state and national laws relating to protecting the environment 
the company is in various stages of investigation  remediation or monitoring of alleged or acknowledged contamination at current or former manufacturing sites for soil and groundwater contamination and visible air emissions  none of which the company believes is material to its results of operations or financial position 
the company s policy is to record monitoring commitments and environmental liabilities when expenses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the costs associated with the company s environmental responsibilities  compliance with federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or costs otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  capital expenditures or competitive position 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page f in this report 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe that actual results will deviate materially from its estimates related to the company s accounting policies described below 
however  because application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter 
in performing this evaluation  the company analyzes the payment history of its significant past due accounts  subsequent cash collections on these accounts and comparative accounts receivable aging statistics 
based on this information  along with consideration of the general strength of the economy  the company develops what it considers to be a reasonable estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in accounts receivable 
this estimate involves significant judgment by management of the company and actual uncollectible amounts may differ materially from the company s estimate 
valuation of inventories 
the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost using the last in  first out lifo method or market 
lifo cost for all of the company s inventories is determined using the dollar value  link chain method 
this method allows for the more current cost of inventories to be reported in cost of goods sold  while the inventories reported on the balance sheet consist of the costs of inventories acquired earlier  subject to adjustment to the lower of cost or market 
hence  if prices are rising  the lifo method will generally lead to higher cost of goods sold and lower profitability as compared to the fifo method 
the company evaluates its inventory for excess or slow moving items based on recent and projected sales and order patterns 
the company establishes an allowance for those items when the estimated market or net sales value is lower than their recorded cost 
this estimate involves significant judgment by management and actual values may differ materially from the company s estimate 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of those assets 
when any such impairment exists  the related assets are written down to fair value 
long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  are no longer depreciated  and are reported separately as assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company s domestic wood furniture manufacturing operations have suffered from lower demand and significant declines in volume for its bedroom  home office and home entertainment products  principally due to competition from lower priced imported furniture products 
these declines led to the closing of the company s roanoke  va 
facility in august  pleasant garden  nc facility in october  maiden  nc facility in october and kernersville  nc facility in august on january   the company announced that it plans to close its last wood manufacturing facility  located in martinsville  va  marking the company s exit from domestic wood furniture manufacturing 
as a result of these plant closings  the company recorded asset impairment charges to write down the carrying value of the related assets to fair market value 
the costs to dispose of these assets are recognized when management commits to a plan of disposal 
severance and related benefits paid to terminated employees affected by the closings are recorded in the period when management commits to a plan of termination 
the company recognizes liabilities for these exit and disposal activities at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
asset impairment charges related to the closure of manufacturing facilities are based on the company s best estimate of expected sales prices  less related selling expenses for assets to be sold 
the recognition of asset impairment and restructuring charges for exit and disposal activities requires significant judgment and estimates by management 
management reassesses its accrual of restructuring and asset impairment charges each reporting period 
any change in estimated restructuring and related asset impairment charges is recognized in the period during which the change occurs 
accounting pronouncements in november  the company adopted the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab clarifies the way that a company should evaluate an identified unadjusted error for materiality 
sab requires that the effect of misstatements that were not corrected at the end of the prior year be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year s financial statements 
two techniques were identified as being used by companies in practice to accumulate and quantify misstatements a the iron 
table of contents curtain approach and b the rollover approach 
the iron curtain approach quantifies a misstatement based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year  irrespective of the misstatement s year s of origination 
the primary weakness of the iron curtain approach is that it does not consider the correction of prior year misstatements in the current year to be errors 
the rollover approach quantifies a misstatement based on the amount of the error originating in the current year income statement

the company recorded as allowed under sab the effect of initial application by adjusting the carrying amounts of the related assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of and recording an offsetting adjustment for the cumulative effect to beginning retained earnings 
the cumulative effect of this error reflects the overstatement of tax expense in years through  however using the rollover method  the error was not material to any period in which it originated 
accordingly  to correct the error  the company recorded the cumulative effect in the amount of  as an increase in beginning retained earnings with corresponding increases in deferred tax assets million  accrued income taxes  and other accrued expenses

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities and through the use of interest rate swap agreements with respect to interest rates 
the company s obligations under its lines of credit and term loan bear interest at variable rates 
the outstanding balance under the company s term loan amounted to million as of november  the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement that  in effect  fixes the rate of interest on its term loan at through the notional principal value of the swap agreement is substantially equal to the outstanding principal balance of the term loan 
a fluctuation in market interest rates of one percentage point or basis points would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
for imported products  the company generally negotiates firm pricing denominated in us dollars with its foreign suppliers  for periods typically of up to one year 
the company accepts the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
more of the company s imports are purchased from china than from any other country 
the chinese currency  formerly pegged to the us dollar  now floats within a limited range in relation to the us dollar  resulting in additional exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
since the company transacts its imported product purchases in us dollars  a relative decline in the value of the us dollar could increase the price the company pays for imported products beyond the negotiated periods 
the company generally expects to reflect substantially all of the effect of any price increases from suppliers in the prices it charges for imported products 
however  these changes could adversely impact sales volume and profit margin during affected periods
