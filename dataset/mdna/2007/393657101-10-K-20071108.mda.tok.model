item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we currently operate in three primary business segments manufacturing  refurbishment parts and leasing services 
these three business segments are operationally integrated 
the manufacturing segment  operating from four facilities in the united states  mexico and europe produces double stack intermodal railcars  conventional railcars  tank cars and marine vessels 
we may also manufacture new freight cars through the use of unaffiliated subcontractors 
the refurbishment parts segment performs railcar repair  refurbishment and maintenance activities in the united states and mexico as well as wheel and axle servicing  and production of a variety of parts for the railroad industry 
the leasing services segment owns approximately  railcars and provides management services for approximately  railcars for railroads  shippers  carriers  and other leasing and transportation companies in north america 
segment performance is evaluated based on margins 
we also produce rail castings through an unconsolidated joint venture 
our manufacturing backlog of railcars for sale and lease as of august  was approximately  railcars with an estimated value of million 
this compares to  railcars valued at billion as of august  backlog includes approximately  units that are subject to our fulfillment of certain competitive conditions 
sales prices generally include an anticipated pass through of vendor material price increases and surcharges  however  there is still risk that material prices could increase beyond amounts used to price our sale contracts which would adversely impact margins realized upon sale 
subsequent to august   an additional multi year order was received for  units to be with delivered over an eight year period commencing in the first quarter of approximately  units under this contract are subject to our fulfillment of certain competitive conditions 
our canadian railcar manufacturing facility had been incurring operating losses as a result of high labor costs  manufacturing inefficiencies  transportation costs associated with a remote location and a strong canadian currency coupled with a weakening of the market for the primary railcars produced by this entity 
these factors caused us to reassess the value of the assets of this facility in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets 
based on an analysis of future undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets  we determined that the carrying value of the assets exceeded their fair market value 
accordingly a million impairment charge was recorded in february as a special charge on the consolidated statement of operations 
in april  our board of directors approved the permanent closure of this facility 
as a result of the asset impairment and subsequent facility closure  aggregate special charges of million were recorded during consisting of million of impairment of property  plant and equipment  million of inventory impairment  million impairment of goodwill and other  million of severance costs and million of professional and other fees associated with the closure 
in addition  an million tax benefit related to a write off of our investment in our canadian subsidiary for tax purposes was recorded 
we are actively marketing the assets and the disposition of the facility is expected to be completed by the end of closure costs which include contractual obligations  professional fees and severance and other employee related costs other than pension costs are estimated to be approximately million of which million has been incurred through august  consisting of million in special charges and million in general and administrative expense 
there is no tax benefit associated with these closure costs 
in november  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of meridian rail holdings  corp 
for million which includes the initial purchase price of million plus working capital adjustments 
meridian is a leading supplier of wheel maintenance services to the north american freight car industry 
operating out of six facilities  meridian supplies replacement wheel sets and axles to approximately freight car maintenance locations where worn or damaged wheels  axles  or bearings are reconditioned or replaced 
meridian also performs coupler reconditioning and railcar repair at other facilities 
in october  we formed a joint venture with grupo industrial monclova gimsa to manufacture new railroad freight cars for the north american marketplace at gimsa s existing manufacturing facility  located in frontera  mexico 
our initial investment was less than million for one production line and each party owns a interest in the joint venture 
production began late in our third quarter of the financial results of this operation the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents are consolidated for financial reporting purposes as the company maintains a controlling interest as evidenced by the right to appoint the majority of the board of directors  control over accounting  financing  marketing and engineering  and approval and design of products 
the minority interest reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements represents the joint venture partner s equity in this venture 
on september   we purchased substantially all of the operating assets of rail car america rca  its american hydraulics division and the assets of its wholly owned subsidiary  brandon corp 
rca is a provider of intermodal and conventional railcar repair services in north america  operating from four repair facilities throughout the united states 
rca also reconditions and repairs end of railcar cushioning units through its american hydraulics division and operates a switching line in nebraska through brandon corp 
the purchase price of the net assets was million of cash and a million promissory note due in september results of operations overview total revenue was billion  million and billion for the years ended august   and net earnings for  and were million or per diluted common share  million or per diluted common share and million or per diluted common share 
manufacturing segment manufacturing revenue includes new railcar and marine production 
new railcar delivery and backlog information disclosed herein includes all facilities and orders that may be manufactured by unaffiliated subcontractors 
manufacturing revenue was million  million and million for the years  and railcar deliveries  which are the primary source of manufacturing revenue  were approximately  units in compared to  units in and  units in manufacturing revenue decreased million  or  from to due to lower railcar deliveries offset somewhat by a change in product mix to railcar types with higher per unit sales prices 
the delivery decline is the result of the impact of a slower north american railcar market for railcar types that we currently produce and the current year production of more complex railcar types requiring higher labor content 
manufacturing revenue decreased million or in as compared to primarily due to lower deliveries resulting from changes in production rates to meet customer delivery requirements  a slower european freight car market  an increase in internal production and subcontracted deliveries in the prior period 
manufacturing margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the decrease was primarily due to a less favorable product mix  million in negative margins on our canadian facility in the current year  start up costs on our new railcar manufacturing joint venture in mexico and production difficulties and inefficiencies realized on certain conventional railcar types 
manufacturing margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in margin improvements were the result of lower costs on certain materials and operating efficiency improvements at certain of our facilities 
in addition  was adversely impacted by production issues in europe  surcharges and price increases on materials that could not be passed onto the customer  temporary production issues at one facility and inclement weather related closures 
refurbishment parts segment refurbishment parts revenue was million  million and million for the years  and the million increase in revenue from to was primarily due to acquisition related growth of approximately million  increased volume of refurbishment and retrofitting work at repair and refurbishment facilities and favorable scrap pricing 
revenue increased million  or  from to primarily due to the addition of four repair and refurbishment facilities 
refurbishment parts margin as a percentage of revenue was  and for  and the acquisition of meridian in has resulted in a greater mix of wheel reconditioning work which combined with increases in volume of railcar maintenance and refurbishment programs  retrofitting work and high scrap the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents prices resulted in the margin increase as compared to the margin increase from to was the result of a more favorable product mix  increased volumes of wheelset sales and improvements in efficiency at certain facilities 
leasing services segment leasing services revenue was million  million and million for the years  and the million increase in revenue from to was primarily the result of a million increase in gains on sale of assets from the lease fleet partially offset by a million decrease in interest income resulting from lower cash balances 
the million increase in revenue from to was primarily the result of increased revenue from new lease additions  a million increase in gains on sale of assets from the lease fleet and increased interest income on higher cash balances 
during  we realized million in pre tax earnings on the disposition of leased equipment compared to million in and million in assets from our lease fleet are periodically sold in the normal course of business in order to take advantage of market conditions  manage risk and maintain liquidity 
leasing services margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in and in the decrease from to was primarily a result of declines in interim rent and interest income  decreased utilization on mileage leases  increases in transportation and storage costs on assets held for sale and higher maintenance costs of the railcar fleet  partially offset by gains on dispositions from the lease fleet 
the increase in was primarily a result of gains on sales from the lease fleet and interim rental on assets held for sale both of which have no associated cost of revenue  renewal of leases at higher lease rates and newer lease equipment with lower maintenance costs 
these gains were partially offset by decreased utilization on railcars subject to management agreements 
other costs selling and administrative expense was million  million and million in  and the million increase from to is primarily due to million associated with operations of business acquired in the current year  million in overhead costs associated with our canadian manufacturing facility that was permanently closed during may  professional services and consulting fees for strategic initiatives and integration of acquired companies  costs associated with improvements to our technology infrastructure and increases in compensation expense related to restricted stock grants 
the million increase from to is primarily the result of increases in employee costs which include new employees  transition costs associated with succession planning  compensation and benefit increases and incentive compensation  million in amortization of the value of restricted stock grants  increases in professional fees associated with strategic initiatives  expenses associated with improvements to our technology infrastructure  increases in european research and development costs  partially offset by reduced legal fees as the prior period included million in legal and professional expenses associated with litigation and responses related to actions by a former member of the board of directors  alan james 
interest and foreign exchange expense was million  million and million in  and interest and foreign exchange expense increased million from to due to higher debt levels and foreign exchange fluctuations 
foreign exchange losses of million were recognized in compared to foreign exchange gains of million in in addition  results include a million write off of loan origination costs on our prior revolving credit facility 
interest and foreign exchange expense increased million from to due to higher outstanding debt levels  million in interest on a settlement with the irs in conjunction with the completion of an audit  million in interest paid on the purchase of subsidiary shares subject to mandatory redemption  partially offset by foreign exchange fluctuations 
foreign exchange gains of million were recognized in compared to foreign exchange losses of million in our canadian railcar manufacturing facility had been incurring operating losses as a result of high labor costs  manufacturing inefficiencies  transportation costs associated with a remote location and a strong canadian currency coupled with a weakening of the market for the primary railcars produced by this entity 
these factors caused us to the greenbrier companies annual report

as a result of the asset impairment and subsequent facility closure  aggregate special charges of million recorded during consist of million of impairment of property  plant and equipment  million of inventory impairment  million impairment of goodwill and other  million of severance costs and million of professional and other fees associated with the closure 
during  we incurred special charges of million consisting of debt prepayment penalties and costs associated with settlement of interest rate swap agreements on certain debt that was refinanced with senior unsecured notes 
income tax our effective tax rate was  and for the years ended august   and the current period includes an million tax benefit associated with the write off of our investment in our canadian subsidiary for tax purposes and no tax benefit associated with special charges related to the canadian plant closure costs and losses incurred by the canadian facility 
the current period also includes tax benefits of approximately million for mexican asset based tax credits and amended state income tax provisions 
tax expense for includes million associated with a settlement with the irs in conjunction with completion of an audit of our tax returns for the years in addition  includes a million tax benefit for a reduction in a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset for net operating loss carryforwards at our mexican subsidiary 
this allowance was reversed based on financial projections that indicated we will more likely than not be able to fully utilize the net operating loss carryforwards 
the fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to the geographical mix of pre tax earnings and losses  minimum tax requirements in certain local jurisdictions and operating losses for certain operations with no related accrual of tax benefit 
our tax rate in the united states for the years ended august   and represents a tax rate of  and 
all periods include varying tax rates on foreign operations 
minority interest the minority interest of million for the year ended august  represents our joint venture partner s share in the losses of our mexican railcar manufacturing joint venture that began production during the year 
liquidity and capital resources we have been financed through cash generated from operations and borrowings 
at august   cash decreased million to million from million at the prior year end 
cash usage was primarily for the acquisitions of meridian and rca  partially offset by proceeds from borrowings 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended august  and was million and million 
cash used in operating activities was million in the change is due primarily to timing of working capital needs including purchases and sales of railcars held for sale  timing of inventory purchases and varying customer payment terms 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended august  of million compared to million in and million in the increased cash utilization in was primarily due to the acquisitions of meridian and rca 
increases in capital expenditures for lease fleet equipment resulted in the increase in cash used in investing activities in as compared to capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in  and of these capital expenditures  approximately million  million and million in  and were attributable to leasing services operations 
our capital expenditures have increased as we replace the maturing direct finance leases and take advantage of investment opportunities in the railcar market 
we regularly sell assets the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents from our lease fleet  some of which may have been purchased within the current year and included in capital expenditures 
proceeds from the sale of equipment were approximately million in leasing services capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million 
approximately million  million and million of capital expenditures for  and were attributable to manufacturing operations 
capital expenditures for manufacturing are expected to be approximately million in and primarily relate to increased efficiency and expansion of manufacturing capacity through our joint venture in mexico 
refurbishment parts capital expenditures for  and were million  million and million and are expected to be approximately million in for expansion of existing facilities 
cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended august compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in and million in during  we received million in net proceeds from term loan borrowings  repaid million in term debt and paid dividends of million 
during  we received million in net proceeds from a senior unsecured debt offering and a convertible debt offering  repaid million in term debt and paid dividends of million

all amounts originating in foreign currency have been translated at the august  exchange rate for the following discussion 
senior secured revolving credit facilities aggregated million as of august   of which million in revolving notes and million in letters of credit are outstanding 
available borrowings are generally based on defined levels of inventory  receivables  and leased equipment  as well as total debt to consolidated capitalization and interest coverage ratios which at august  levels would provide for maximum additional borrowing of million 
a million revolving line of credit is available through november to provide working capital and interim financing of equipment for the united states and mexican operations 
a million line of credit is available through november for canadian operations 
advances under the us and canadian facilities bear interest at variable rates that depend on the type of borrowing and the defined ratio of debt to total capitalization 
at august   there was million in letters of credit outstanding under the united states credit facility 
a million letter of credit was outstanding under the canadian credit facility 
lines of credit totaling million are available for working capital needs of the european manufacturing operation 
these european credit facilities have maturities that range from december  through august  as of august   the european credit facilities had million outstanding 
in accordance with customary business practices in europe  we have million in bank and third party performance  advance payment and warranty guarantee facilities  all of which has been utilized as of august  to date no amounts have been drawn under these performance  advance payment and warranty guarantees 
we have advanced million in long term advances to an unconsolidated subsidiary which are secured by accounts receivable and inventory 
as of august   this same unconsolidated subsidiary had million in third party debt for which we have guaranteed or approximately million 
we have outstanding letters of credit aggregating million associated with facility leases and payroll 
foreign operations give rise to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts with established financial institutions to hedge a portion of that risk 
no provision has been made for credit loss due to counterparty non performance 
dividends have been paid each quarter since the th quarter of when dividends of 
per share were reinstated 
the dividend was increased to 
per share in the th quarter of we expect existing funds and cash generated from operations  together with proceeds from financing activities including borrowings under existing credit facilities and long term financing  to be sufficient to fund dividends  working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and expected debt repayments for the foreseeable future

such amounts  referred to as participation  are accrued when earned  charged to leasing services cost of revenue  and unpaid amounts are included as participation in the consolidated balance sheets 
participation expense was million  million and million in  and payment of participation was million in off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have off balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires judgment on the part of management to arrive at estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates may affect the amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities within the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are periodically evaluated and may be adjusted in future periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
income taxes for financial reporting purposes  income tax expense is estimated based on planned tax return filings 
the amounts anticipated to be reported in those filings may change between the time the financial statements are prepared and the time the tax returns are filed 
further  because tax filings are subject to review by taxing authorities  there is also the risk that a position taken in preparation of a tax return may be challenged by a taxing authority 
if the taxing authority is successful in asserting a position different than that taken by us  differences in tax expense or between current and deferred tax items may arise in future periods 
such differences  which could have a material impact on our financial statements  would be reflected in the financial statements when management considers them probable of occurring and the amount reasonably estimable 
valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
our estimates of the realization of deferred tax assets is based on the information available at the time the financial statements are prepared and may include estimates of future income and other assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
maintenance obligations we are responsible for maintenance on a portion of the managed and owned lease fleet under the terms of maintenance obligations defined in the underlying lease or management agreement 
the estimated maintenance liability is based on maintenance histories for each type and age of railcar 
these estimates involve judgment as to the future costs of repairs and the types and timing of repairs required over the lease term 
as we cannot predict with certainty the prices  timing and volume of maintenance needed in the future on railcars under long term leases  this estimate is uncertain and could be materially different from maintenance requirements 
the liability is periodically reviewed and updated based on maintenance trends and known future repair or refurbishment requirements 
these adjustments could be material due to the inability to predict future maintenance requirements 
the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents warranty accruals warranty costs to cover a defined warranty period are estimated and charged to operations 
the estimated warranty cost is based on historical warranty claims for each particular product type 
for new product types without a warranty history  preliminary estimates are based on historical information for similar product types 
these estimates are inherently uncertain as they are based on historical data for existing products and judgment for new products 
if warranty claims are made in the current period for issues that have not historically been the subject of warranty claims and were not taken into consideration in establishing the accrual or if claims for issues already considered in establishing the accrual exceed expectations  warranty expense may exceed the accrual for that particular product 
conversely  there is the possibility that claims may be lower than estimates 
the warranty accrual is periodically reviewed and updated based on warranty trends 
however  as we cannot predict future claims  the potential exists for the difference in any one reporting period to be material 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
railcars are generally manufactured  repaired or refurbished under firm orders from third parties 
revenue is recognized when railcars are completed  accepted by an unaffiliated customer and contractual contingencies removed 
direct finance lease revenue is recognized over the lease term in a manner that produces a constant rate of return on the net investment in the lease 
operating lease revenue is recognized as earned under the lease terms 
certain leases are operated under car hire arrangements whereby revenue is earned based on utilization  car hire rates and terms specified in the lease agreement 
car hire revenue is reported from a third party source two months in arrears  however  such revenue is accrued in the month earned based on estimates of use from historical activity and is adjusted to actual as reported 
these estimates are inherently uncertain as they involve judgment as to the estimated use of each railcar 
adjustments to actual have historically not been significant 
revenues from construction of marine barges are either recognized on the percentage of completion method during the construction period or on the completed contract method based on the terms of the contract 
under the percentage of completion method  judgment is used to determine a definitive threshold against which progress towards completion can be measured to determine timing of revenue recognition 
impairment of long lived assets when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of certain long lived assets may not be recoverable  the assets will be evaluated for impairment 
if the forecast undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value will be recognized in the current period 
these estimates are based on the best information available at the time of the impairment and could be materially different if circumstances change 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets the company periodically acquires businesses in purchase transactions in which the allocation of the purchase price may result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates affect the amount of future period amortization and possible impairment charges

forward looking statements from time to time  greenbrier or its representatives have made or may make forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  including  without limitation  statements as to expectations  beliefs and strategies regarding the future 
such forward looking statements may be included in  but not limited to  press releases  oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer or in various filings made by us with the securities and exchange commission 
these forward looking statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events 
you can identify these forward looking statements by forward looking words such as expect  anticipate  believe  intend  plan  seek  forecast  estimate  continue  may  will  would  could  likely and similar expressions 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict  may be beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated or suggested by these forward looking statements and that could adversely affect our future financial performance and stockholder value are identified in risk factors and may also include the following continued industry demand at current levels for railcar products  industry overcapacity and our manufacturing capacity utilization  ability to utilize beneficial tax strategies  decreases in carrying value of assets due to impairment  changes in future maintenance requirements  effects of local statutory accounting conventions on compliance with covenants in certain loan agreements  delays in receipt of orders  risks that contracts may be canceled during their term or not renewed and that customers may not purchase as much equipment under existing contracts as anticipated  and ability to replace maturing lease revenue and earnings with revenue and earnings from additions to the lease fleet and management services 
any forward looking statement should be considered in light of these factors and reflects our belief only at the time the statement is made 
we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements to reflect actual results  changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting the forward looking statements

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we have operations in mexico  germany and poland that conduct business in their local currencies as well as other regional currencies 
to mitigate our exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each entity  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect the margin on a portion of forecast foreign currency sales 
at august   no forecast sales were hedged by foreign exchange contracts 
because of the variety of currencies in which purchases and sales are transacted and the interaction between currency rates  it is not possible to predict the impact a movement in a single foreign currency exchange rate would have on future operating results 
we believe the exposure to foreign exchange risk is not material 
in addition to exposure to transaction gains or losses  we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to the net asset position of our foreign subsidiaries 
at august   net assets of foreign subsidiaries aggregated million and a uniform strengthening of the united states dollar relative to the foreign currencies would result in a decrease in stockholders equity of million  of total stockholders equity 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the united states dollar 
interest rate risk we have managed our floating rate debt with interest rate swap agreements  effectively converting million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
at august   the exposure to interest rate risk is reduced since of our debt has fixed rates and has floating rates 
as a result  we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our revolving debt and a portion of term debt 
at august   a uniform increase in interest rates would result in approximately million of additional annual interest expense
