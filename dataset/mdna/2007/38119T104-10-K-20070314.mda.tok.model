glossary of terms we report our mineral reserves to two separate standards to meet the requirements for reporting in both canada and the united states us 
canadian reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by national instrument ni 
the definitions in ni are adopted from those given by the canadian institute of mining  metallurgy and petroleum 
us reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by sec industry guide these reporting standards have similar goals in terms of conveying an appropriate level of confidence in the disclosures being reported  but embody differing approaches and definitions 
we estimate and report our mineral resources and mineral reserves according to the definitions set forth in ni and modify and reconcile them as appropriate to conform to industry guide for reporting in the us the definitions for each reporting standard are presented below with supplementary explanation and descriptions of the parallels and differences 
ni definitions mineral reserve the term mineral reserve refers to the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
the study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction can be justified 
a mineral reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that might occur when the material is mined 
proven mineral reserve the term proven mineral reserve refers to the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
this study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction is justified 
probable mineral reserve the term probable mineral reserve refers to the economically mineable part of an indicated  and in some circumstances  a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
this study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction can be justified 
mineral resource the term mineral resource refers to a concentration or occurrence of diamonds  natural  solid  inorganic material  or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals  coal  and industrial minerals in or on the earth s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction 
the location  quantity  grade  geological characteristics and continuity of a mineral resource are known  estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge 

table of contents measured mineral resource the term measured mineral resource refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity  grade or quality  densities  shape and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters  to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit 
the estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration  sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pits  workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity 
indicated mineral resource the term indicated mineral resource refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity  grade or quality  densities  shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters  to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit 
the estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pits  workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed 
inferred mineral resource the term inferred mineral resource refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed  but not verified  geological and grade continuity 
the estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pits  workings and drill holes 
qualified person the term qualified person refers to an individual who is an engineer or geoscientist with at least five years of experience in mineral exploration  mine development or operation or mineral project assessment  or any combination thereof  has experience relevant to the subject matter of the project and the technical report and is a member in good standing of a professional association 
sec industry guide definitions reserve the term reserve refers to that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
reserves must be supported by a feasibility study done to bankable standards that demonstrates the economic extraction 
bankable standards implies that the confidence attached to the costs and achievements developed in the study is sufficient for the project to be eligible for external debt financing 
a reserve includes adjustments to the in situ tonnes and grade to include diluting materials and allowances for losses that might occur when the material is mined 
proven reserve the term proven reserve refers to reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable reserve the term probable reserve refers to reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven measured reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling  and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
mineralized material the term mineralized material refers to material that is not included in the reserve as it does not meet all of the criteria for adequate demonstration for economic or legal extraction 
non reserves the term non reserves refers to mineralized material that is not included in the reserve as it does not meet all of the criteria for adequate demonstration for economic or legal extraction 

table of contents exploration stage an exploration stage prospect is one which is not in either the development or production stage 
development stage a development stage project is one which is undergoing preparation of an established commercially mineable deposit for its extraction but which is not yet in production 
this stage occurs after completion of a feasibility study 
production stage a production stage project is actively engaged in the process of extraction and beneficiation of mineral reserves to produce a marketable metal or mineral product 
industry guide does not require designation of a qualified person 
for industry guide purposes the feasibility study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction is justified

gold sales and production ghana has been a significant gold producing country for over years with anglogold ashanti s obuasi mine and our inactive underground mine at prestea historically being the two major producers 
several other areas in ghana have also produced significant amounts of gold 
the gold industry in ghana is currently experiencing growth in exploration and development and gold production 
annual gold production in ghana has exceeded two million ounces in recent years and is expected to increase as planned developments and expansions now underway reach the production stage 
all of our gold production is sold to a south african gold refinery 
our gold is sold in the form of dor bars which average approximately gold by weight with the remaining portion being primarily silver 
revenue is recognized when title is transferred at the refinery 
the sales price is based on the london pm fix on the day of delivery to the refinery 

table of contents gold price history the price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions  inflation or deflation  fluctuation in the relative values of the us dollar and foreign currencies  changes in global and regional gold demand  and the political and economic conditions of major gold producing countries throughout the world

table of contents the following diagram depicts the organizational structure of golden star and its significant subsidiaries flow chart business strategy and development since  our business and development strategy has been focused primarily on the acquisition of producing and development stage gold properties in ghana and on the exploration  development and operation of these properties 
since  our exploration efforts have been focused on ghana  other west african countries and south america 
in line with our business strategy  we acquired bogoso in and have operated a cil processing plant at bogoso since that time the bogoso cil processing plant 
in  we acquired prestea and have been mining surface deposits at prestea since late in late  we acquired wassa  and following completion of a feasibility study  constructed a new cil processing plant at wassa which began commercial operation in april the wassa cil processing plant 
we are in the process of completing and commissioning a nominal million tonnes per year processing facility that uses a proprietary biox bio oxidation technology to treat refractory sulfide ore the bogoso biox processing plant 
we have stockpiled about one million tonnes of refractory ore  and the new processing facility is currently processing ore 
we expect to complete commissioning of the bogoso biox processing plant in march  with operations expected to commence in april and throughput and metallurgical recoveries increasing over the remainder of based on currently known proven and probable mineral reserves and after the bogoso biox processing plant comes on line  we expect a mine life of approximately years at bogoso prestea 
achievement of this target is subject to numerous risks 
see the discussion of risk factors in item a of this form k 
in late  we acquired the hbb properties 
during we carried out geological  environmental and engineering studies to determine the economic feasibility of these undeveloped gold properties 
these studies will continue into our overall objective since has been to grow our business to become a mid tier gold producer with an annualized production rate of approximately  ounces 
we anticipate reaching this production rate in the fourth quarter of once the bogoso sulfide expansion project has achieved full production 
we continue to evaluate potential acquisition and merger opportunities that could further increase our annual gold production 
however we presently have no agreement or understanding with respect to any specific potential transaction 
we also conduct gold exploration in west africa and south america  investing approximately million on such activities during the majority of our exploration spending was focused on our new hbb properties south of wassa  on the prestea underground and on expanding mineral reserves around our existing mines 
we actively conducted 
table of contents regional reconnaissance projects in south ghana  cote d ivoire and sierra leone and have drilled more advanced targets in ghana  niger and burkina faso 
we employ a number of different strategies to achieve our exploration goals including the following we maintain a staff of geologists in ghana responsible for exploring for new mineral resources in ghana and for developing new mineral reserves in areas around the existing operations  we contract with geologic consultants who advise us on existing holdings and who seek to identify new exploration opportunities  we have purchased equity ownership in gold exploration companies that use the equity funds provided by us to explore in their areas of expertise  we provide funding to joint venture partners that use our funding to conduct active exploration efforts  and we maintain an international exploration group that carries out work on various properties in the guiana shield area of south america and in other areas of africa outside of ghana 
our assets bogoso prestea property our bogoso prestea gold mine consists of two ore processing facilities and several open pit mines 
ore is hauled by truck from the pits to the processing plants 
the nominal combined capacity of the bogoso cil processing plant and the bogoso biox processing plant is expected to be approximately million tonnes of ore per year 
in addition to the mine and processing plant facilities  bogoso prestea s assets include a fleet of mining equipment  numerous ancillary facilities including warehouses  maintenance shops  roadways  administrative offices and a residential complex 
historical gold output at the bogoso processing plant has typically ranged between  and  ounces per year 
see the gold production and unit costs table below for additional details on historical production and operating costs 
the bogoso prestea property also incorporates the following prestea underground the prestea underground is located directly beneath the prestea property 
it consists of a large underground gold mine that operated for over years under a number of former owners 
we are continuing to conduct exploration and development drilling and carry out engineering  geological and economic analysis of the mine to determine if it can be reopened on a profitable basis 
the mine includes three useable shafts which allow access to all levels and several kilometers of underground workings on numerous levels extending as deep as  meters below the surface 
pampe the pampe deposit is located approximately kilometers west of the bogoso processing plants 
we have identified an probable mineral reserve of million tonnes at an average gold grade of g t  which we believe is recoverable by open pit mining methods 
development of this deposit as a satellite to our bogoso prestea property is substantially complete and ore production commenced in march mampon the mampon deposit is located approximately kilometers north of the bogoso processing plant 
it was acquired in as part of the dunkwa property acquisition 
mampon is an undeveloped gold deposit with million tonnes of probable mineral reserves at an average gold grade of g t which we believe is recoverable by open pit mining methods 
production from this deposit  as a satellite pit to our bogoso prestea property  is scheduled to begin in late wassa property we own and operate the wassa gold mine in southwest ghana 
the property includes four open pits  a nominal million tonne per annum cil processing plant with its crushing and grinding circuits  a fleet of mining equipment  ancillary facilities including an administration building  a warehouse  a maintenance shop  a stand by power generating facility and a residential complex 
the new wassa cil processing plant was completed in early and placed in service on april  the plant s nominal design processing capacity ranges from to million tonnes per year depending on hardness of the ore 
wassa s gold production and operating costs are shown on the gold production and unit costs table below 
hbb properties the hbb properties consist primarily of the hwini butre and benso concessions containing undeveloped zones of gold mineralization and which together cover an area of square kilometers 
these two properties are located between and kilometers south of our wassa mine 
prior to our acquisition  the previous owner conducted extensive exploration work at hwini butre and benso and based on our review of this past work as well as our own exploration efforts  we estimated an indicated mineral resource at december  of approximately million tonnes at an average gold grade of g t 
exploration assets we have interests in numerous gold exploration properties in ghana  cote d ivoire  sierra leone  burkina faso  niger  french guiana  suriname and in other areas of south america

amounts shown exclude fourth quarter sales of  ounces produced during commissioning activities at the bogoso sulfide expansion project 
represents wassa production for the nine month period following its april  in service date 
mineral reserves our proven and probable mineral reserves are estimated in conformance with definitions set out in ni technical reports on our mineral reserves for bogoso prestea and wassa have been filed as required by ni the proven and probable mineral reserves are those ore tonnages contained within economically optimized pits  configured using current and predicted mining and processing methods and related operating costs and performance parameters 
we believe that our mineral reserves are estimated on a basis consistent with the definition of proven and probable reserves prescribed for use in the us by the us securities and exchange commission and set forth in sec industry guide see our glossary of terms 
in estimating mineral reserves  we first design an economically optimized pit based on all operating costs  including the costs to mine 
since all material lying within the optimized pit will be mined  the cut off grade used in determining our mineral reserves is estimated on the basis of material that  having been mined  is economic to transport and process without regard to primary mining costs ie mining costs that were appropriately applied at the economic optimization stage 
the qa qc controls program used in connection with the estimation of our mineral reserves consists of regular insertion and analysis of blanks and standards to monitor laboratory performance 
blanks are used to check for contamination 
standards are used to check for grade dependence biases 
a total of eleven standards are used  five generated by golden star ranging from to g t and six commercially available standards ranging from to g t

table of contents the terms non refractory and refractory refer to the metallurgical characteristics of the ore and are defined in the glossary of terms 
we plan to process the refractory ore in our biox bio oxidation plant that is currently being constructed at bogoso and to process the non refractory ore using our more traditional gravity  flotation and or cyanidation techniques 
optimized pit parameters are based on historical and projected operating costs at bogoso prestea and wassa and estimated costs for processing refractory ores in the biox plant 
metallurgical recoveries are based on historical performance or estimated from test work and typically range between to for non refractory ores and are estimated at to for refractory ores 
pit designs are based on geotechnical criteria established by external consultants 
mining dilution and mining recovery vary by deposit and have been applied in estimating the mineral reserves 
mineral reserves are expressed on a basis 
our share of the mineral reserves is subject to the government of ghana s carried interest which entitles it to a dividend once our capital costs have been recovered 
numbers may not add due to rounding 
stockpiled ores stockpiled ores are included in the mineral reserves for both bogoso prestea and wassa

where such a variance occurs it will arise from the differing requirements for reporting mineral reserves

we advise us investors that while this term is recognized and required by canadian regulations  the us securities and exchange commission does not recognize it 
inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence  and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility 
it cannot be assumed that all or any part of inferred mineral resources will ever be upgraded to a higher category 
in accordance with canadian rules  estimates of inferred mineral resources cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies

we have the right to acquire this property 
employees as of december   golden star  including our majority owned subsidiaries  had approximately  permanent employees and approximately full time contract employees  a increase from the approximately  people employed at the end of the total includes employees at our principal office in littleton  colorado 
customers currently all our gold production is sold to a south african gold refinery in accordance with a long term contract 
we receive payment for gold sold approximately five working days after the gold leaves the mine site 
we recognize revenue 
table of contents when title passes to the buyer which occurs upon delivery to the refinery  unless we decide to retain title and hold the gold as inventory 
during we sold all of the gold shipped  retaining no inventory of saleable dor bars 
the global gold market is competitive with numerous banks and refineries willing to buy gold on short notice 
therefore we believe that the loss of our current customer would not materially delay or disrupt revenues 
competition our competitive position depends upon our ability to successfully and economically explore  acquire and develop new and existing mineral properties 
factors that allow producers to remain competitive in the market over the long term include the quality and size of ore bodies  costs of operation  and the acquisition and retention of qualified employees 
we compete with other mining companies and other natural mineral resource companies in the acquisition  exploration  financing and development of new mineral properties 
many of these companies are larger and better capitalized than we are 
there is significant competition for the limited number of gold acquisition and exploration opportunities 
we also compete with other mining companies for skilled mining engineers  mine and processing plant operators and mechanics  geologists  geophysicists and other technical personnel 
this could result in higher turnover and greater labor costs 
seasonality most of our operations are in tropical climates which experience annual rainy seasons 
typically mining operations are not materially affected by the rainy seasons in ghana but unusually high rainfall in some years have impeded mine production at bogoso prestea and heavy rains have in the past on occasion interrupted underground drilling in the prestea underground 
exploration efforts in ghana and in the guiana shield in south america are generally timed to avoid the rainy periods to ease transportation logistics associated with wet roads and swollen rivers 
recent decreases in rainfall in the volta river catchment basin has resulted in reduced electric power availability from a hydroelectric power plant that produces a major portion of ghana s electric power

risk factors risk factors you should consider the following discussion of risks in addition to the other information contained in or included by reference in this form k 
in addition to historical information  the information in this form k contains forward looking statements about our future business and performance 
our actual operating results and financial performance may be very different from what we expect as of the date of this form k 
the risks below address material factors that may affect our future operating results and financial performance 
financial risks a substantial or prolonged decline in gold prices would have a material adverse effect on us 
the price of our common shares  our financial results and our exploration  development and mining activities have previously been  and would in the future be  significantly adversely affected by a substantial or prolonged decline in the price of gold 
the price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions  inflation or deflation  fluctuation in the value of the united states 
table of contents dollar and foreign currencies  global and regional demand  and the political and economic conditions of major gold producing countries throughout the world 
any drop in the price of gold adversely impacts our revenues  profits and cash flows 
in particular  a sustained low gold price could cause suspension of our mining operations at bogoso prestea and wassa if the operations become uneconomic at the then prevailing gold price  thus further reducing revenues  cause us to be unable to fulfill our obligations under agreements with our partners or under our permits and licenses which could cause us to lose our interests in  or be forced to sell  some of our properties  cause us to be unable to fulfill our debt payment obligations  halt or delay the development of new projects  and reduce funds available for exploration  with the result that depleted reserves are not replaced 
furthermore  the need to reassess the feasibility of any of our projects because of declining gold prices could cause substantial delays or could interrupt operations until a reassessment could be completed 
mineral reserve estimations and life of mine plans using significantly lower gold prices could result in reduced estimates of mineral reserves and non reserve mineral resources and in material write downs of our investment in mining properties and increased amortization  reclamation and closure charges 
we may incur substantial losses in the future that could make financing our operations and business strategy more difficult 
we experienced a net loss of million in and have experienced net losses in other prior fiscal years 
numerous factors  including declining gold prices  lower than expected ore grades or higher than expected operating costs including increased commodity prices  and impairment write offs of mine property and or exploration property costs  could cause us to be unprofitable in the future 
future operating losses could make financing our operations and our business strategy  including pursuit of the growth opportunities anticipated at the hbb properties  or raising additional capital  difficult or impossible and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
our obligations could strain our financial position and impede our business strategy 
we had total consolidated debt and liabilities as of december  of million  including million payable to banks  million in equipment financing loans  million in senior convertible notes maturing on april   million of current trade payables  accrued current and other liabilities  million of future taxes  a million accrual for environmental rehabilitation liabilities and million of derivative and other liabilities 
we expect that our indebtedness and other liabilities will increase as a result of our corporate development activities 
these liabilities could have important consequences  including the following increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  exploration costs and other general corporate requirements  requiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments  which would reduce our ability to fund working capital  capital expenditures  exploration costs and other general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and placing us at a disadvantage when compared to our competitors that have less debt relative to their market capitalization 

table of contents our estimates of mineral reserves and non reserves could be inaccurate  which could cause production and costs to differ from estimates 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating proven and probable mineral reserves and non reserves  measured  indicated and inferred mineral resources  including many factors beyond our control 
the accuracy of estimates of mineral reserves and non reserves is a function of the quantity and quality of available data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation  which could prove to be unreliable 
these estimates of mineral reserves and non reserves may not be accurate  and mineral reserves and non reserves may not be able to be mined or processed profitably 
fluctuation in gold prices  results of drilling  metallurgical testing  production  and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimate could require revision of the estimates 
the volume and grade of mineral reserves mined and processed and recovery rates might not be the same as currently anticipated 
for example  approximately of the reduction in wassa s mineral reserves at year end resulted from changes in the resource model at wassa based on our mining experience 
any material reductions in estimates of our mineral reserves and non reserves  or of our ability to extract these mineral reserves and non reserves  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently have only two sources of operational cash flows  which will likely be insufficient by themselves to fund our continuing exploration and development activities 
while we have received significant infusions of cash from sales of our equity and debt  and in from the sale of shares of euro ressources sa and moto goldmines limited  our only current significant internal sources of funds are operational cash flows from bogoso prestea and wassa 
the anticipated continuing exploration and development of our properties are expected to require significant expenditures over the next several years  which should increase as we focus on development of the hbb properties 
we expect that these expenditures will exceed free cash flows generated by bogoso prestea and wassa during and possibly in later years and therefore we expect to require additional external debt or equity financing in the future 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms  which could cause us to delay or indefinitely postpone further exploration and development of our properties 
as a result  we could lose our interest in  or could be forced to sell  some of our properties 
we are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could materially adversely affect our financial position 
our revenues are in united states dollars  and we maintain most of our working capital in united states dollars or united states dollar denominated securities 
we convert our united states funds to foreign currencies as certain payment obligations become due 
accordingly  we are subject to fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the united states dollar and these foreign currencies  and these fluctuations could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
a significant portion of the operating costs at bogoso prestea and wassa is based on the ghanaian currency  the cedi 
we are required to convert into cedis only of the foreign exchange proceeds that we receive from selling gold  but the government of ghana could require us to convert a higher percentage of gold sales proceeds into cedis in the future 
in addition  we currently have future obligations that are payable in south african rand and euros  and receivables collectible in euros 
we obtain construction and other services and materials and supplies from providers in south africa and other countries 
the costs of goods and services could increase due to changes in the value of the united states dollar or the cedi  euros  the south african rand or other currencies  such as the recent cost increase due to the decrease in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies 
consequently  operation and development of our properties might be more costly than we anticipate 
in the past  we have purchased south african rand and euro forward contracts to hedge the expected purchase of capital assets in south africa and europe in connection with the bogoso sulfide expansion project 
we may engage in additional currency hedges in the future in connection with other projects 
implementation of a currency hedging program may not adequately protect us from the effects of fluctuation in currency exchange rates 
gold hedging could be unsuccessful and result in losses 
we purchased put options puts and sold call options calls from time to time during the construction phase of the new processing plant at bogoso in ghana 
puts give us the right but not the obligation to sell gold in the future at a fixed price 
calls are contractual commitments which require us to sell gold at a fixed price on specified future dates 
if the spot market gold price exceeds the call option price on the specified sale date  we would receive the call price rather than the higher spot market price for the gold ounces covered by the call option 
of our expected production  approximately is subject to calls at per ounce  and approximately is protected by puts at a floor price of per ounce 

table of contents all of our hedges were closed or expired by march   and we have decided not to implement a more general hedging program on gold production from our own properties at this time 
we continue to review whether or not  in light of the potential for gold prices to fall  it would be appropriate to establish a more general hedging program 
risks inherent in acquisitions that we might undertake could adversely affect our current business and financial condition and our growth 
we plan to continue to pursue the acquisition of producing  development and advanced stage exploration properties and companies 
the search for attractive acquisition opportunities and the completion of suitable transactions are time consuming and expensive  divert management attention from our existing business and may be unsuccessful 
success in our acquisition activities depends on our ability to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms and integrate the acquired operations successfully with our operations 
any acquisition would be accompanied by risks 
for example  there may be a significant change in commodity prices after we have committed to complete a transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio  a material ore body may prove to be below expectations or the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant 
we may lose the services of our key employees or the key employees of any business we acquire or have difficulty integrating operations and personnel 
the integration of an acquired business or assets may disrupt our ongoing business and our relationships with employees  suppliers and contractors 
any one or more of these factors or other risks could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition of properties or companies  and could have a material adverse effect on our current business and financial condition and on our ability to grow 
we are subject to litigation risks 
all industries  including the mining industry  are subject to legal claims  with and without merit 
we are involved in various routine legal proceedings  which include labor matters such as unfair termination claims  supplier matters and property issues incidental to our business 
defense and settlement costs can be substantial  even with respect to claims that have no merit 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process  the resolution of any particular legal proceeding could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
operational risks the technology and cost of production with respect to refractory materials at bogoso prestea remain subject to a number of uncertainties 
we began processing refractory ore from bogoso prestea at the bogoso biox processing plant in early our projections for include assumptions that i the bogoso biox processing plant will be operational on april   ii the processing technology will achieve certain anticipated efficiencies and iii production will increase and cash operating costs will decrease at certain rates throughout we have experienced delays in the past in building and commissioning this plant for operations  and the plant utilizes a technology that has not been commercially utilized under our circumstances  including on the bogoso prestea refractory sulfide ore 
there can be no assurance that our assumptions regarding anticipated efficiencies and timing will be realized 
if we experience delays in start up or other problems with the technology  our production and cost estimates for and thereafter may not be achieved 
we are subject to a number of operational hazards that can delay production or result in liability to us 
our activities are subject to a number of risks and hazards including difficulty in applying technology such as bio oxidation processing  power shortages  environmental hazards  discharge of pollutants or hazardous chemicals  industrial accidents  labor disputes and shortages  supply and shipping problems and delays  shortage of equipment and contractor availability  unusual or unexpected geological or operating conditions  
table of contents cave ins of underground workings  slope failures and failure of pit walls or dams  fire  marine and transit damage and or loss  changes in the regulatory environment  and natural phenomena such as inclement weather conditions  floods  droughts and earthquakes 
these or other occurrences could result in damage to  or destruction of  mineral properties or production facilities  personal injury or death  environmental damage  delays in mining  delayed production  monetary losses and possible legal liability 
we could incur liabilities as a result of pollution and other casualties 
satisfying such liabilities could be very costly and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our mining operations are subject to numerous environmental laws  regulations and permitting requirements that can delay production and adversely affect operating and development costs 
compliance with existing regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to environmental protection  in the jurisdictions where we have projects may have a material adverse effect on our exploration activities  results of operations and competitive position 
new or expanded regulations  if adopted  could affect the exploration or development of our projects or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations 
a significant portion of our dunkwa property and portions of our wassa property  as well as some of our exploration properties in ghana  are located within forest reserve areas 
although dunkwa and wassa have been identified by the government of ghana as eligible for mining permits  subject to normal procedures and a site inspection  permits for projects in forest reserve areas may not be issued in a timely fashion  or at all  and such permits may contain special requirements with which it is burdensome or uneconomic to comply 
mining and processing gold from the south end of the prestea property and from the pampe and mampon properties and other activities will require mining and other permits from the government of ghana 
these permits may not be issued on a timely basis or at all  and such permits  when issued  may be subject to requirements or conditions with which it is burdensome or uneconomic to comply 
such permitting issues could adversely affect our projected production commencement dates  production amounts and costs 
due to an increased level of non governmental organization activity targeting the mining industry in ghana  the potential for the government of ghana to delay the issuance of permits or impose new requirements or conditions upon mining operations in ghana may be increased 
any changes in the government of ghana s policies may be costly to comply with and may delay mining operations 
the exact nature of other environmental control problems  if any  which we may encounter in the future cannot be predicted  primarily because of the changing character of environmental requirements that may be enacted within various jurisdictions 
to the extent that we are subject to any such changes  they may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
as a result of the foregoing risks  project expenditures  production quantities and rates and cash operating costs  among other things  could be materially and adversely affected and could differ materially from anticipated expenditures  production quantities and rates  and costs 
in addition  estimated production dates could be delayed materially 
any such events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the development and operation of our mining projects involve numerous uncertainties that could affect the feasibility or profitability of such projects 
mine development projects  including our recent development at wassa and expansion at bogoso prestea  and the potential development of the hbb properties  if mineral reserves are established  typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible 

table of contents development projects are subject to the completion of successful feasibility studies and environmental assessments  issuance of necessary governmental permits and receipt of adequate financing 
the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors such as estimation of mineral reserves and mineral resources  mining rate  dilution and recovery anticipated metallurgical and throughput recovery rates  environmental considerations and permitting  future gold prices  and anticipated capital and operating costs 
our mine development projects could have limited relevant operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements 
estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves and operating costs determined in feasibility studies are based on geologic and engineering analyses and might not prove to be accurate 
the management of mine development projects and start up of new operations are complex  and we do not have a history of simultaneously managing ongoing operations  the start up of a new operation and a significant development project 
completion of development and the commencement of production may be subject to delays  as occurred at wassa and in connection with the bogoso sulfide expansion project 
any of the following events  among others  could affect the profitability or economic feasibility of a project unanticipated changes in grade and tonnage of ore to be mined and processed  unanticipated adverse geotechnical conditions  incorrect data on which engineering assumptions are made  costs of constructing and operating a mine in a specific environment  availability and cost of processing and refining facilities  availability of economic sources of power  adequacy of water supply  adequate access to the site including competing land uses such as agriculture and illegal mining  unanticipated transportation costs and shipping incidents and losses  significant increases in the cost of diesel fuel  cyanide or other major components of operating costs  government regulations including regulations relating to prices  royalties  duties  taxes  permitting  restrictions on production  quotas on exportation of minerals  as well as the costs of protection of the environment and agricultural lands  fluctuations in gold prices  and accidents  labor actions and force majeure events 
adverse effects on the operations or further development of a project could also adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
because of these uncertainties  and others identified in these risk factors  our production estimates at bogoso prestea and wassa may not be achieved 

table of contents we need to continually discover  develop or acquire additional mineral reserves for gold production and a failure to do so would adversely affect our business and financial position in the future 
because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable mineral reserves  we must continually replace and expand our mineral reserves as our mines produce gold 
we estimate that once the bogoso biox processing plant comes on line  bogoso prestea has about ten years of remaining mine life and wassa has about three and one half years of remaining mine life based on current mineral reserves  but our estimates may not be correct 
in addition  mine life would be shortened if we expand production 
our ability to maintain or increase our annual production of gold will be dependent in significant part on our ability to bring new mines into production and to expand or extend the life of existing mines 
gold exploration is highly speculative  involves substantial expenditures  and is frequently non productive 
gold exploration  including the exploration of the prestea underground  the hbb properties and other projects  involves a high degree of risk 
exploration projects are frequently unsuccessful 
few prospects that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines 
we cannot assure you that our gold exploration efforts will be successful 
the success of gold exploration is dependent in part on the following factors the identification of potential gold mineralization based on superficial analysis  availability of prospective land  availability of government granted exploration and exploitation permits  the quality of our management and our geological and technical expertise  and the funding available for exploration and development 
substantial expenditures are required to determine if a project has economically mineable mineralization 
it could take several years to establish proven and probable mineral reserves and to develop and construct mining and processing facilities 
as a result of these uncertainties  we cannot assure you that current and future exploration programs will result in the discovery of mineral reserves  the expansion of our existing mineral reserves and the development of mines 
we face competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties 
we face strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties producing  or capable of producing  precious metals 
many of these companies have greater financial resources  operational experience and technical capabilities 
as a result of this competition  we might be unable to maintain or acquire attractive mining properties on terms we consider acceptable or at all 
consequently  our future revenues  operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
title to our mineral properties could be challenged 
we seek to confirm the validity of our rights to title to  or contract rights with respect to  each mineral property in which we have a material interest 
we have mining leases with respect to our bogoso prestea  wassa  and prestea underground properties and own the exploration concessions that comprise the hbb properties 
however  we cannot guarantee that title to our properties will not be challenged 
title insurance generally is not available  and our ability to ensure that we have obtained a secure claim to individual mineral properties or mining concessions could be severely constrained 
we generally do not conduct surveys of our properties until they have reached the development stage  and therefore  the precise area and location of such properties could be in doubt 
accordingly  our mineral properties could be subject to prior unregistered agreements  transfers or claims  and title could be affected by  among other things  undetected defects 
in addition  we might be unable to operate our properties as permitted or to enforce our rights with respect to our properties 
we depend on the services of key executives 
we are dependent on the services of key executives including our president and chief executive officer and a small number of highly skilled and experienced executives and personnel 
due to the relatively small size of our management team  the loss of these persons or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees could adversely affect the exploration and development of our properties  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and future operations 
the period of weak gold prices prior to resulted in depletion of the number of trained and experienced professionals and managers in our industry 
higher gold prices have resulted in an increased demand for these people  and it could therefore be more difficult to attract or retain such experienced professionals and managers without significantly increasing the cost to us 

table of contents our insurance coverage could be insufficient 
our business is subject to a number of risks and hazards generally  including adverse environmental conditions  industrial accidents  labor disputes  unusual or unexpected geological conditions  ground or slope failures  cave ins  changes in the regulatory environment  marine transit and shipping damage and or losses  natural phenomena such as inclement weather conditions  floods and earthquakes  and political risks including expropriation and civil war 
such occurrences could result in damage to mineral properties or production facilities  personal injury or death  loss of legitimate title to properties  environmental damage to our properties or the properties of others  delays in mining  processing and development  monetary losses  and possible legal liability 
although we maintain insurance in amounts that we believe to be reasonable  our insurance might not cover all the potential risks associated with our business 
we might also be unable to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums 
insurance coverage might not continue to be available or might not be adequate to cover any resulting liability 
moreover  insurance against risks such as environmental pollution or other hazards as a result of exploration and production is not generally available to us or to other companies in the mining industry on acceptable terms 
we might also become subject to liability for pollution or other hazards which we cannot insure against or which we might elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons 
losses from these events might cause us to incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance and results of operations 
governmental and regulatory risks as a holding company  limitations on the ability of our operating subsidiaries to make distributions to us could adversely affect the funding of our operations 
we are a holding company that conducts operations through foreign principally ghanaian subsidiaries and joint ventures  and substantially all of our assets consist of equity in these entities 
accordingly  any limitation on the transfer of cash or other assets between the parent corporation and these entities  or among these entities  could restrict our ability to fund our operations efficiently  or to repay our convertible notes or other debt 
any such limitations  or the perception that such limitations might exist now or in the future  could have an adverse impact on available credit and our valuation and stock price 
we are subject to changes in the regulatory environment where we operate which may increase our costs of compliance 

table of contents our mining operations and exploration activities are subject to extensive regulation governing various matters  including licensing  production  taxes  disposal of process water or waste rock  toxic substances  development and permitting  exports and imports  labor standards  mine and occupational health and safety  environmental protections  and mine closure plans 
compliance with these regulations increases the costs of the following planning  designing  drilling  operating  developing  constructing  and closure and reclamation 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations in ghana and elsewhere 
however  these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and reinterpretation 
due to the substantial increase in mining development in ghana in recent years  the government of ghana has been reviewing the adequacy of reclamation bonds and guarantees throughout the country and in some cases has requested higher levels of bonding than previously had been required 
our bonds may be increased 
amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities of mining companies or more stringent implementation or interpretation of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on us  cause a reduction in levels of production and delay or prevent the development or expansion of our properties in ghana 
government regulations limit the proceeds from gold sales that could be withdrawn from ghana 
changes in regulations that increase these restrictions could have a material adverse impact on us  as bogoso prestea and wassa are currently our only sources of internally generated operating cash flows 

table of contents the government of ghana has the right to increase its control of certain subsidiaries 
in accordance with the minerals and mining act  act  the government of ghana has a free carried interest in the mineral operations of mining companies 
the carried interest comes into existence at the time the government issues a mining license 
as such  the government of ghana currently has a carried interest in our subsidiaries that own the bogoso prestea mine  the wassa mine and a carried interest in the prestea underground property in ghana  and would have a carried interest in the hbb properties if mining permits were issued 
under the new mining law  the government has the right to acquire a special share or golden share in such subsidiaries at any time for no consideration or such consideration as the government of ghana and such subsidiaries might agree  and a pre emptive right to purchase all gold and other minerals produced by such subsidiaries 
the government of ghana may seek to exercise this right and adversely affect our ability to take certain actions 
we are subject to risks relating to exploration  development and operations in foreign countries 
certain laws  regulations and statutory provisions in certain countries in which we have mineral rights could  as they are currently written  have a material negative impact on our ability to develop or operate a commercial mine 
for countries where we have exploration or development stage projects  we intend to negotiate mineral agreements with the governments of these countries and seek variances or otherwise be exempted from the provisions of these laws  regulations and or statutory provisions 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be successful in obtaining mineral agreements or variances or exemptions on commercially acceptable terms 
in addition  our assets and operations are affected by various political and economic uncertainties  including the risks of war  civil unrest  terrorism  coups or other violent or unexpected changes in government  political instability and violence  expropriation and nationalization  renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions  licenses  permits  and contracts  illegal mining  changes in taxation policies  restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation  and changing political conditions  currency controls  and governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
illegal mining has occurred on our properties  is difficult to control  can disrupt our business and can expose us to liability 
from time to time we have experienced significant illegal mining activity on our mining and exploration properties 
the ghana ministry of national security initiated a country wide operation in late to remove illegal miners from legal mineral concessions in ghana  including those at our properties 
while this action was successful in removing the illegal miners from our leases  there can be no assurance that illegal mining will not resume 
in addition to the impact on our mineral reserve and non reserves  the presence of illegal miners can lead to project delays and disputes and delays regarding the development or operation of commercial gold deposits 
the work performed by the illegal miners could cause environmental damage or other damage to our properties  or personal injury or death  for which we could potentially be held responsible 
illegal miners may work on other of our properties from time to time  and they may in the future increase their presence and have increased negative impacts such as those described above on such other properties 

table of contents our activities are subject to complex laws  regulations and accounting standards that can adversely affect operating and development costs  the timing of operations  the ability to operate and financial results 
our business  mining operations and exploration and development activities are subject to extensive canadian  united states  ghanaian and other foreign  federal  state  provincial  territorial and local laws and regulations governing exploration  development  production  exports  taxes  labor standards  waste disposal  protection of the environment  reclamation  historic and cultural resource preservation  mine safety and occupational health  toxic substances  reporting and other matters  as well as accounting standards 
compliance with these laws  regulations and standards or the imposition of new such requirements could adversely affect operating and development costs  the timing of operations  the ability to operate and financial results 
failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price 
we are required to annually test our internal control over financial reporting to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price 
market risks the market price of our common shares could experience volatility and could decline significantly 
our common shares are listed on the american stock exchange and the toronto stock exchange 
securities of small capitalization companies have experienced substantial volatility in the past  often based on factors unrelated to the financial performance or prospects of the companies involved 
these factors include macroeconomic developments in north america and globally and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries 
our share price is also likely to be significantly affected by short term changes in gold prices or in our financial condition or results of operations as reflected in our quarterly earnings reports 
other factors unrelated to our performance that could have an effect on the price of our common shares include the following the extent of analytical coverage available to investors concerning our business could be limited if investment banks with research capabilities do not continue to follow our securities  the trading volume and general market interest in our securities could affect an investor s ability to trade significant numbers of common shares  the size of the public float in our common shares may limit the ability of some institutions to invest in our securities  and a substantial decline in our stock price that persists for a significant period of time could cause our securities to be delisted from the american stock exchange and the toronto stock exchange  further reducing market liquidity 
as a result of any of these factors  the market price of our common shares at any given point in time might not accurately reflect our long term value 
the market has recently suffered major declines  occurring around the time of our public offering of common shares 
securities class action litigation often has been brought against companies following periods of market price volatility which affects the market price of particular securities without regard to the performance of the company whose stock price is affected 
we could in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and damages and divert management s attention and resources 
investors could have difficulty or be unable to enforce certain civil liabilities on us  certain of our directors and our experts 
golden star is a canadian corporation 
substantially all of our assets are located outside of canada and the united states  and our head office is located in the united states 
it might not be possible for investors to collect judgments obtained in canadian courts predicated on the civil liability provisions of canadian or us securities legislation 
it could also be difficult for you to effect service of process in connection with any action brought in the united states upon our directors and officers 
execution by united states courts of any judgment obtained against us  or any of the directors or executive officers  in the united states courts would be limited to our assets or the assets of such persons in the united states 
the enforceability in canada of united states judgments or liabilities in original actions in canadian courts predicated solely upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states is doubtful 

table of contents there are certain us federal income tax risks associated with ownership of golden star common shares 
holders of our common shares or warrants or options to purchase our common shares who are united states taxpayers should consider that we could be considered to be a passive foreign investment company pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
although we believe that we were not a pfic for and that we will not be a pfic for  and do not expect to become a pfic in the foreseeable future  the tests for determining pfic status depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will not be a pfic 
if we are a pfic for any year  any holder of our common shares or warrants or options to purchase our common shares who is a us person for us income tax purposes a us holder and whose holding period for those shares  warrants or options includes any portion of a year in which we are a pfic generally would be subject to a special adverse tax regime in respect of excess distributions 
excess distributions include certain distributions received on shares in a pfic in a taxable year 
gain recognized by a us holder on a sale or other transfer of warrant or options to purchase our shares including certain transfers that would otherwise be tax free would also generally be taxed as an excess distribution 
excess distributions are generally taxed at ordinary income rates and are subject to a nondeductible interest charge and to other adverse rules 
certain elections may sometimes be used to mitigate the adverse tax rules that apply to pfics the so called qef and mark to market  but these elections may accelerate the recognition of taxable income and may result in the recognition of ordinary income 
the qef and mark to market elections are not be available for us holders with respect to warrants or options to acquire our common shares 
additional adverse rules would apply to us holders of our common shares for any year in which we are a pfic and own or dispose of shares in another corporation that is also a pfic 
the existence of outstanding rights to purchase or acquire common shares could impair our ability to raise capital 
as of march   approximately million common shares are issuable on exercise of warrants and options to purchase common shares at prices ranging from cdn to cdn 
in addition  million common shares are currently issuable upon conversion of our senior convertible notes issued in april during the life of the warrants  options  notes and other rights  the holders are given an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of common shares  with a resulting dilution in the interest of the other shareholders 
our ability to obtain additional financing during the period such rights are outstanding could be adversely affected  and the existence of the rights could have an adverse effect on the price of our common shares 
the holders of the warrants  options  notes and other rights can be expected to exercise or convert them at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able to obtain any needed capital by a new offering of securities on terms more favorable than those provided by the outstanding rights

accra  the capital city of ghana  is located on the prime meridian 
following a period as a british colony  ghana achieved independence in and it is now a republic with a democratically elected government 
ghana has a population of approximately million people 
english is the official and commercial language 
the total land area of the country is 
table of contents approximately  square kilometers and the topography is relatively flat 
ghana has a tropical climate with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year 
rights to explore and develop a mine are administered by the minister of lands  forests and mines through the minerals commission  a governmental organization designed to promote and control the development of ghana s mineral wealth in accordance with the current mining law 
a company or individual can apply to the minerals commission for a renewable exploration license granting exclusive rights to explore for a particular mineral in a selected area for an initial period not exceeding three years 
when exploration has successfully delineated a mineable mineral reserve  an application may be made to the minerals commission for conversion to a mining lease  granting a company the right to produce a specific product from the concession area  normally for a period of to years 
production must typically begin within two years of the date of grant of a mining lease 
the new minerals and mining act  act  which came into effect in march requires that any person who intends to acquire a controlling share of the equity of any mining company that has been granted a mining lease by the government of ghana must first give notice of its intent to the government and obtain its consent prior to acquiring a controlling share 
in accordance with the current mining law  the government of ghana is granted a carried interest in all companies such as golden star bogoso prestea limited gsbpl and golden star wassa limited gswl that hold mining leases 
the carried interest entitles the government of ghana to a pro rata share of future dividends none have been declared to date  if any  from gsbpl and gswl once all capital is repaid 
the government of ghana has no obligation to contribute development or operating expenses 
gsbpl and gswl owe million and million  respectively  to golden star or its subsidiaries as of december  for past advances  and these amounts would be repaid to us before payment of any dividends 
under the old mining law the government of ghana was entitled to acquire up to an additional interest in our operating companies at a mutually agreed price 
under the current mining law the government of ghana no longer has the right to acquire this additional interest 
the government of ghana is also entitled to acquire a special or golden share in gsbpl or gswl or any mining company at any time for no consideration or such consideration as the government of ghana and gsbpl or gswl might agree 
the special share would constitute a separate class of shares with such rights as the government of ghana and gsbpl or gswl might agree 
in the absence of such agreement  the special share would have the following rights the special share would carry no voting rights  but the holder would be entitled to receive notice of and attend and speak at any general meeting of the members or any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares  the special share could only be issued to  held by  or transferred to the government or a person acting on behalf of the government  the written consent of the holder of the special share would be required for all amendments to the organizational documents of the company  the voluntary winding up or liquidation of the company or the disposal of any mining lease or the whole or any material part of the assets of the company  the special share does not confer a right to participate in the dividends  profits or assets of the company or a return of assets in a winding up or liquidation of the company  the holder of a special share may require the company to redeem the special share at any time for no consideration or for a consideration determined by the company 
gsbpl and gswl have not issued nor to date been requested to issue a special share to the government of ghana 
the government of ghana has a pre emptive right to purchase all gold and other minerals produced by gsbpl and gswl 
the purchase price would be agreed by the government of ghana and gsbpl and gswl  or the price established by any gold hedging arrangement between gsbpl or gswl and any third party approved by the government  or the publicly quoted market price prevailing for the minerals or products as delivered at the mine or plant where the right of preemption was exercised 
the government of ghana has agreed to take no preemptive action pursuant to its right to purchase gold or other minerals so long as gswbl and gswl sell gold in accordance with certain procedures approved by the bank of ghana 
ghanaian royalty requirements under the mining law a holder of a mining lease is required to pay quarterly a royalty of not less than and not more than of gold revenues 
the government of ghana determines the royalty percentage each year based on the ratio that the operating margin bears to the value of gold produced from a mining lease in that year 
based on the mineral royalty regulation of  the royalty is when the operating ratio is or less  the royalty increases for each increase in operating ratio until the royalty reaches a maximum of at an operating ratio of 
in  and 
table of contents the royalty rate for gsbpl was of revenues and gsbpl paid million  million and million  respectively 
the royalty payments from gsbpl have not exceeded per annum in any year 
gswl paid a royalty of million and million in and  respectively 
ghanaian environmental regulations all environmental matters in ghana  including those related to mining  fall under the oversight of the ghana environmental protection agency epa 
the epa has formulated rules and guidelines which govern environmental impact statements  mine operations  and mine closure and reclamation  to which our operations are subject 
additional provisions governing surface uses by our stakeholders are provided in the minerals and mining act act  
in  pursuant to a reclamation bonding agreement between the epa and gswl  we bonded million to cover future reclamation obligations at wassa 
to meet the bonding requirements we established a million letter of credit and deposited million of cash with the epa 
in addition  pursuant to a bonding agreement between the epa and gsbpl  we bonded million in early to cover our future obligations at bogoso prestea 
to meet these requirements  we deposited million of cash with the epa with the balance covered by a letter of credit 
we completed a review of the asset retirement obligations for bogoso prestea and wassa in additional work has been completed at bogoso prestea to rehabilitate disturbed lands and reduce long term corporate liabilities including re profiling waste dumps  capping hard rock with oxide materials  topsoil spreading and planting for both slope stabilization and long term rehabilitation 
rehabilitation expenditures totaled million  million and million in   and  respectively to our knowledge  all our operations in ghana are currently in substantial compliance with all environmental requirements 
community development programs and sustainability we conduct our business as a responsible corporate citizen in keeping with our environmental  social and health and safety policies 
we believe our ongoing success in ghana can only be achieved by continuing to build good relations with our local stakeholder communities and by incorporating stakeholder comments and addressing their concerns in our developing projects 
we believe our success as an employer  as a neighbor and as an important part of the local economy is dependent on achieving and maintaining good community relationships while helping to develop a more sustainable economy that is not solely dependent on our activities 
as such  we are committed to sharing our success with our neighbors through our development foundation and our oil palm project 
our work in focused on furthering the alternative livelihood projects that were providing the most benefit to the communities  and developing and implementing a strategy to provide our neighbors with more control over the infrastructure and development projects that we fund 
on reviewing the alternative livelihood program  we found that poultry farming and small business development were successfully providing sustainable livelihoods to a large number of stakeholders 
of the people that were trained to develop their own small businesses  are still deriving their income from these businesses 
this is a success rate of almost 
key among the successes are a number of single mothers who are now able to support their families as a result of their commitment and our trainings and investment in their future 
the aim of the economic development activities in will be to make the various participants independent and self supporting 
a measure of success in the poultry project was achieved when the cooperative was able to assist with program funding for new members from funds repaid to the cooperative by its members 
although we invested in local infrastructure during the past several years  our efforts were driven by our own people with some input from the local communities 
this resulted in projects that  although worthwhile  were not focused on key community needs 
to address this  during we established the golden star development foundation to fund all future community projects 
the foundation is funded by us by contributions equal to per ounce of gold produced plus of pretax profit 
projects are selected by a community consultation committee 
the first project approved for funding was the electrification of a village 
community support of another kind came from the golden star head office in the form of a book drive 
initiated in  our staff in denver have worked with local high school student volunteers to collect  sort and pack books with the first shipment arriving in ghana in by year end  our project had collected over  books that will be placed in libraries in our stakeholder communities 
librarians have been selected for some of these libraries and the process of getting the books onto the shelves has begun 
another of our major economic diversity efforts is our golden star oil palm project 
this project builds on the existing abilities within the local community to diversify economic opportunities for individuals who would be unable to establish a palm oil plantation due to either limitations on land or funding 
we established links with the local traditional authorities who then provided us with access to land 
using local labor  the land was prepared for planting and then oil palms planted 
for the first three to four years  we will fund the development of the project and pay the people preparing the land and caring for the seedlings 
after this  the more mature palms begin to produce fruit and hence income 
at this point  blocks of about four 
table of contents hectares will be assigned to individuals or family groups who then care for the trees while receiving technical assistance and inputs from the project 
when the fruit is harvested  the individual growers sell the fruit to the project and receive their money minus the input costs 
we first promoted the use of oil palms as a way to diversify the local economy as part of our alternative livelihood program 
funding was subsequently channeled into the golden star oil palm project with the specific goal of managing the oil palm plantations as a sustainable business 
to date  the areas planted with oil palms total hectares and hectares for the alternative livelihood program and golden star oil palm project  respectively 
operating properties the bogoso prestea gold mine overview of the bogoso prestea operation bogoso prestea consists of a gold mining and processing operation located along the ashanti trend in western ghana  approximately kilometers northwest of the town of tarkwa 
it can be reached by paved roads from tarkwa  a local commercial center  and from accra  the capital of ghana 
bogoso and prestea are adjoining mining concessions that together cover approximately kilometers of strike of the southwest trending ashanti gold district 
our mining areas at bogoso and prestea are linked to the bogoso processing plants by paved and gravel haul roads located on our properties 
equipment and facilities at bogoso prestea include open pit mines  a nominal million tonne per annum bogoso cil processing plant  a nominal million tonne per annum bogoso biox processing plant  and a fleet of haul trucks  loaders and mining support equipment 
in addition  there are numerous ancillary support facilities including power and water supply equipment  haul roads  housing for management and technical staff  a medical clinic  a tailings storage facility  waste dumps  a warehouse  maintenance shops  offices and administrative facilities 
there is also a large inactive underground mine at prestea 
the bogoso prestea properties and mining rights are granted under four mining leases  which expire on or after august we acquired bogoso in late and all of our production came from reserves located on the bogoso property until october when we commenced surface mining on the adjoining prestea property 
the prestea property was acquired in mid operating results for bogoso prestea the following table displays historical operating results at bogoso prestea 
bogoso prestea operating results ore milled t rate t day grade milled g t recovery total gold sales oz cash operating cost oz total cash cost oz gold sale is shown on a basis  which represents our current beneficial interest in gold production and revenues 
once all capital has been repaid  the government of ghana would receive of the dividends from the subsidiaries owning the bogoso prestea and wassa mines 
in addition to the gold production shown above   ounces of gold were recovered during testing and commissioning of the new bogoso biox plant crushing  grinding and cil circuits 
bogoso prestea expansion project gold ore reserves in general and specifically at bogoso prestea can be segregated into two general ore types referred to as refractory and non refractory 
refractory ores typically contain un oxidized sulfide minerals with the gold trapped within the sulfide minerals 
such ores are also commonly referred to as sulfide ores and they cannot be economically processed in conventional cil circuits such as our existing bogoso cil processing plant which we have operated since non refractory ores typically do not contain sulfide minerals  or the sulfide minerals have been oxidized in situ by natural geologic processes 
there are also certain sulfide ores that are considered non refractory if the gold exists on the surface of the sulfide minerals rather than being embedded within the sulfide minerals 
ores that have been naturally oxidized are referred to as oxide ores 
non refractory ores  including oxide ores  can be efficiently processed through the existing bogoso cil processing plant 
about of the remaining ore reserves at bogoso prestea are refractory and cannot be processed by the bogoso cil processing plant 
therefore in june  a decision was made to construct the million tonne per annum bogoso biox processing plant adjacent to the existing cil processing plant 
the new plant uses a proprietary biox bio oxidation technology to 
table of contents treat the refractory sulfide ore 
we expect to complete construction and commissioning of the bogoso biox processing plant in march with operations expected to commence in april and throughput and metallurgical recoveries increasing over the remainder of the new bogoso biox processing plant  together with the existing bogoso cil processing plant  are expected to be capable of processing a combined million tonnes of gold ore per year 
the existing bogoso cil processing plant will retain its current configuration and will continue to process non refractory ores while the new bogoso biox processing plant will process mostly refractory sulfide ores and mixed oxide refractory ores 
the two plants sitting side by side are expected to provide operational efficiencies since they will share management  labor  reagents  a warehouse and maintenance efforts 
with the two plants and their differing technologies  we should be able to effectively process all of the ore types known to exist in the bogoso prestea area 
pre stripping of two sulfide pits in readiness for the commissioning of the bogoso biox processing plant has stockpiled or exposed in the pits approximately million tonnes of refractory ore as of december  the bogoso cil processing plant has processed oxide and non refractory ores from the plant north pit at prestea since  but mining of this deposit was completed in december the bogoso cil processing plant is now temporarily processing stockpiled ores and limited amounts of non refractory ores encountered in the new sulfide pits until march when we plan to begin feeding the bogoso cil processing plant with oxide ores from the pampe deposit 
later in  we expect to initiate non refractory ore mining on the south end of the prestea property and this ore will be trucked to the bogoso cil processing plant 
there are additional non refractory deposits at various locations in the bogoso area  including at the south end of the prestea property and at mampon 
the known non refractory ore deposits should be adequate to provide ore feed to the bogoso cil processing plant for the next years 
project costs to december  are as follows as of december  plant construction cost mining equipment cost pre production stripping cost sub total costs prior to project commencement capitalized interest total in  we expect combined gold production from the two bogoso plants to total approximately  ounces at an average cash operating cost of per ounce 
based on test work  we expect gold recoveries from the bogoso biox processing plant to average and vary between and 
in the early stage of the project  when processing ore mined from close to the surface  recoveries will be at the lower end of the expected range 
since august  the government of ghana has rationed power to large industrial users  including bogoso prestea and wassa  due in part to the effects of low rainfall on hydroelectric power generation 
under the current rationing program  we expect to receive of our power requirements  including requirements for the full operation of the bogoso biox processing plant 
as a result of the power rationing  we together with three other mining companies  have agreed to acquire a nominal megawatt power station  which is expected to be operational by mid our share of the power station  at an estimated cost to us of million  should be sufficient to provide up to of our total power requirements and  combined with our diesel generators and power available from the national grid  should provide power in excess of our requirements 
if there is inadequate rainfall in  we may be adversely affected by further rationing  which could increase our anticipated cash operating costs 
geology at bogoso prestea the bogoso prestea property lies within the eburnean tectonic province in the west african precambrian shield along a kilometer stretch of the ashanti trend located immediately south of the town of bogoso 
the area is dominated by a major northeast southwest trending structural fault zone referred to as the ashanti trend  which hosts the prestea  bogoso  obuasi and konongo gold deposits  among others 
parallel to the ashanti trend is the akropong trend  which hosts the ayanfuri deposit 
the akropong trend is about kilometers west of the ashanti trend in the bogoso region  and gradually converges with it at obuasi forming the basis for the obuasi mine  which is owned and operated by anglogold ashanti limited 
mineral reserves and non reserve mineral resources at bogoso prestea at december   bogoso prestea had proven and probable mineral reserves  including the probable mineral reserves at mampon and at pampe discussed below  of million tonnes at a grade of g t containing approximately million ounces of gold before any reduction for the government of ghana s minority interest 
total measured and indicated mineral resources  including measured and indicated mineral resources at mampon and pampe discussed below  total million tonnes with a grade of g t before a reduction for the minority interest 
assuming no new reserves are discovered  the current proven and probable mineral reserves should support mining operations for approximately ten years  although we expect the mine life to be extended as we continue to evaluate mineral resources through ongoing 
table of contents exploration efforts 
see the proven and probable mineral reserves table and the non reserves measured and indicated mineral resource table in item of this form k 
exploration at bogoso prestea surface exploration was limited at bogoso during  following a major drilling program in undertaken to facilitate efficient mine planning for the sulfide deposits which will feed the bogoso biox processing plant for the next several years 
we plan additional drilling in for design of final pit models for the chujah dumasi and buesichem deposits near bogoso and to commence evaluation of possible longer term underground mining potential 
surface exploration drilling on the prestea property during was focused on expanding known near surface potential on the south end of the prestea property 
we also evaluated shallow underground targets in the plant north pit vicinity where encouraging results were obtained from the main reef footwall structure  a laminated quartz reef which lies to meters into the footwall of the prestea main reef 
historical exploration of the footwall reef was limited and we believe this constitutes an opportunity for shallow  decline accessible underground mining 
we plan further drilling of this target in to help determine if the deposit can be accessed from a decline driven from the bottom of the plant north pit 
to better define the geometry of deeper parts of the ashanti trend on our bogoso prestea properties we plan to complete a deep penetration vtem airborne geophysical survey during this survey is expected to help map flexures and dislocations in the ashanti trend structure that could provide a host for deeper  non outcropping gold deposits similar to those exposed at the surface 
the pampe project the pampe deposit is located approximately kilometers west of the bogoso processing plant on the akropong trend 
drilling during identified a probable mineral reserve at december  of million tonnes at an average gold grade of g t which is either oxide ore or non refractory sulfide ore and which we believe is recoverable by open pit mining methods 
environmental permits were finalized in november and haul road construction is substantially complete 
ore mining and delivery of ore to the bogoso cil processing plant commenced in march the mampon project the mampon deposit lies along the ashanti trend approximately kilometers north of the bogoso processing plants 
it was acquired in  as part of the dunkwa property acquisition 
an analysis of the drilling and other geologic data provided by the former owner as well as our own drilling since the acquisition date has established a probable mineral reserve at december  of approximately million tonnes grading grams per tonne or approximately  ounces of gold which is accessible by open pit mining methods 
the geology of the mampon deposit is similar to the geology at bogoso prestea 
our current plan is to haul the mampon ore by truck to the bogoso processing plant to supplement ores from the bogoso prestea deposits 
based on our current long term mining plan we expect to initiate mining at mampon in mampon ore is approximately refractory and non refractory 
exploration during will target the deeper  potentially underground exploitable extensions of the mampon deposit and drilling to convert resources at the nearby aboronye deposit to indicated status 
prestea south formerly referred to as bondaye tuapim area due to the presence of illegal miners during much of only limited drilling was carried out on the south end of the prestea property 
however  in november  the ghanaian authorities were able to halt illegal mining on our properties and we have since completed a drilling campaign in these areas 
this work confirmed the previously defined inferred resources 
this oxide material  if proven economic  would be trucked to the bogoso cil plant beginning in late we also expect to commence initial investigation of the shallow and ultimately the deeper underground potential of this area which is outside of the immediate tuampim and bondaye shaft areas 
the wassa gold mine overview of the wassa gold mine the wassa gold mine  located approximately kilometers east of bogoso prestea  was initially developed in the late s by a consortium of european mining companies and consisted of an open pit mine  a crusher and a conventional heap leach operation 
while operating as a heap leach property  wassa produced approximately  ounces of gold per year from until mid when mining operations were suspended 
in september  gswl  our owned subsidiary  acquired the inactive wassa gold property 
as with gsbpl  the government of ghana holds a carried interest which entitles it to of any future dividends none have been declared 
table of contents to date 
dividend payments will not be made until gswl has repaid all contributed capital and shareholder advances to golden star 
in late  following completion of a feasibility study  we initiated construction of a nominal million tonnes per year wassa cil processing plant 
the construction phase ended in early  and the wassa open pit mine and plant was placed in service on april  in the nine months ended december   wassa processed million tonnes of ore at an average grade of grams per tonne and sold  ounces of gold at an average total cash cost per ounce of plant feed was a mixture of newly mined ore from the wassa pit blended with material from the heap leach pads left by the prior owners 
during  a total of  ounces of gold was sold at wassa at an average cash operating cost of approximately per ounce 
in  we expect gold sales of approximately  ounces at an average cash operating cost of approximately per ounce 
the proven and probable mineral reserves at wassa at the end of should be sufficient to support operations to mid if the feasibility study for the hbb properties indicates it is economical to haul ore from these properties to the wassa cil processing plant  the project life of the combined operation could be extended 
geology at wassa wassa lies within the eburnean tectonic province in the west african precambrian shield 
the proterozoic rocks that comprise most of the west african craton and host the major gold mineralization in ghana are subdivided into metasedimentary and volcanic rocks of the birimian and tarkwaian sequences 
wassa is hosted within the same birimian volcano sedimentary greenstone package as bogoso prestea 
however  wassa is situated on the southeastern flank of the ashanti belt while bogoso and prestea occur along the northwestern flank 
the northwestern flank of the belt hosts the obuasi  prestea  and bogoso gold mines  but the southeastern flank also is characterized by gold mines and mineral occurrences 
tarkwaian hosted deposits along the southeastern limb include goldfield s tarkwa and abosso mines  while birimian hosted gold occurrences include the million ounce akyem deposit owned by newmont mining  the deposits on our hbb properties and wassa

wassa operating results ore milled t rate t day grade milled g t recovery total gold production oz cash operating cost oz total cash cost oz mineral reserves and mineral resources at wassa as at december   wassa has proven and probable mineral reserve of million tonnes with an average grade of g t containing approximately million ounces of gold before any reduction for the government of ghana s minority interest 
the total measured and indicated mineral resources consist of million tonnes with a grade of approximately g t before any reduction for the minority interest 
see the proven and probable mineral reserves table and the non reserves measured and indicated mineral resource table in item of this k 
exploration at wassa exploration activities at wassa during focused on target generation activities  particularly at the bawdia boso  area two and along the tarkwaian birimian contact on our accra newtown concession 
soil and auger sampling at these locations has generated numerous high quality targets that we plan to drill test during  with the ultimate aim of providing additional mill feed for wassa and thereby extending the mine life 
wassa based exploration also covers the chichiwelli property acquired as part of the benso property package where work during has generated extensive soil gold anomalies associated with old galamsey artisanal workings 
we expect that this area will also be drilled in 
table of contents exploration stage properties in ghana prestea underground overview the prestea underground is an inactive underground gold mine located to the south of bogoso prestea and adjacent to the town of prestea 
the property consists of two access shafts and extensive underground workings and support facilities 
support facilities include an administrative office  maintenance shops  a warehouse and electrical substations 
access to the mine site is via a paved road from tarkwa and accra maintained by the government of ghana 
any potential future production from the prestea underground would be trucked to the bogoso plants for processing 
from the s to when mining ceased following an extended period of low gold prices  the prestea underground operations produced approximately nine million ounces of gold  the second highest production of any mine in ghana 
the underground workings are extensive  reaching depths of approximately  meters and extending along a strike length of approximately nine kilometers 
underground workings can currently be accessed via two surface shafts  one near the town of prestea and a second approximately four kilometers to the southwest at bondaye 
gsbpl now holds a ownership in the prestea underground with the government of ghana holding a ownership in prestea underground as well as its holding in gsbpl  resulting in an beneficial ownership by golden star 
underground drilling continued until late in when illegal mining in the vicinity of the bondaye shaft caused damage to the shaft resulting in its closure 
this in turn resulted in the suspension of all underground activities at prestea as bondaye was the alternate egress for all of the underground workings 
we expect that the suspension will remain in place until major refurbishment work is completed on both bondaye and central shafts 
geology of prestea underground the prestea deposits are found along the ashanti trend which extends over kilometers and which accounts for to of the total quartz lode hosted gold extracted in ghana 
other mines located along the same shear are our bogoso pits and the obuasi and konongo mines owned by others 
two types of gold hosts have historically been recognized at prestea fault related hydrothermal quartz veins  and disseminated sulfide hosted gold mineralization associated with metavolcanic pods 
the first type of ore was the focus of intense mining during prestea s past production 
we intend to evaluate both types of mineralization 
mineral resources at prestea underground as of december  we have identified total indicated mineral resources at the prestea underground of million tonnes at an average grade of g t before any reduction for the minority interest 
exploration activities at prestea underground a total of  meters of underground exploration drilling was completed at the prestea underground during the drilling focused on testing extensions of the high grade west reef shoot between levels and a depth of between and meters and the commencement of drilling of unmined down plunge extensions of the main reef below level 
drilling on the west reef between and levels resulted in an indicated resource of million tonnes at an average grade of grams per tonne in a roughly by meter block 
although this deposit appears to be narrowing at depth  further drilling is required to test down plunge repetitions within the west reef structure 
initial drilling below level returned encouraging results from the main reef structure  confirming its down plunge continuity 
once shaft repairs allow renewed access to the underground workings  this area will constitute one of our major exploration targets 
total exploration costs at the prestea underground were million during we expect to complete a feasibility study for the development and mining of the prestea underground in late we continue to believe these deeper levels provide the best opportunities for significant new discoveries at prestea underground 
however  the major refurbishment work required for both the bondaye and central shafts is unlikely to be completed before the end of and consequently we expect exploration during to focus on shallower sections of the reefs that can be drilled from the surface 
hbb properties the hwini butre and benso prospecting licenses were acquired in late december these lie at the southeastern end of the ashanti trend in ghana 
while we currently hold a interest in these properties through our subsidiaries  the government of ghana would become entitled to a carried interest at the time mining permits are granted 

table of contents the hwini butre property is located approximately kilometers south of wassa and occupies an area of approximately square kilometers 
the prior owner and its predecessors previously carried out numerous exploration programs on the property and identified two significant zones of gold mineralization 
the benso property is located directly north of the hwini butre property and about kilometers south of wassa 
the property covers an area of approximately square kilometers  and consists of three properties the amantin  subriso  and chichiwelli 
the prior owner and its predecessors previously conducted a geochemical soil sampling survey over the entire benso property and drill programs on the three blocks 
we commenced our own exploration activities on the hbb properties in early  and have spent approximately million for the program to year end 
the hbb properties lie along the southeastern flank of the birimian aged lower proterozoic ashanti belt  along the same structural trend as wassa 
the southwestern part of the hwini butre property covers the mpohor complex  a syn volcanic mafic intrusive that is bound to the east and north by the butre volcanic sequence 
the mpohor complex is a polyphase intrusion with compositions ranging from gabbroic to granophyric  with intermediate phases such as diorite and granodiorite 
the butre volcanic sequence  which also underlies the benso property further north  mostly comprises volcanic flows with minor metasediment horizons 
the main regional structural orientation trends northeasterly but extensive north to northwest trending cross cutting fracture systems are also well developed 
the latter host much of the mineralization in the district  with vein systems at dabokrom  father brown  adoikrom  the subriso zones and amantin located within or marginal to the mpohor complex 
mineralization on the hwini butre property is typically associated with shallowly east dipping narrow quartz veins and their associated sericitic alteration halos  with coarse free gold associated with sulfides and as specks within the quartz veins and altered host rocks 
in contrast  mineralization at subriso west and central subriso forms a series of relatively steep dipping  north trending zones characterized by strong shearing and pervasive silica replacement with local silica flooding and only minor thin quartz veining 
exploration activities on the hwini butre property during concentrated on the father brown  adoikrom and dabokrom prospects in the southern portion of the property 
the objectives of these programs were to test the strike extensions of the known zones of mineralization and to test the higher grade father brown zone down dip to determine whether it has potential for underground exploitation 
the programs were successful in delineating an extension of the adiokrom zone to the south and the down dip extension of the father brown zone 
in  we plan to continue drilling to investigate additional targets at father brown  adiokrom and dabokrom 
however  the main focus of future programs will be to test the northern portion of the concession where several colonial gold occurrences breminsu  apotunso  abada  whinnie and guadium are located 
previous soil sampling in these areas has identified several anomalies which require deep auger followed by rab drilling if justified 
exploration on the benso property during focused on testing the full potential of the property with extensive soil and deep auger surveys covering the entire property on a by meter spacing 
anomalies generated by the soil sampling campaigns were tested with rab drilling which identified several new zones of mineralization which we plan to follow up with rc and diamond core drilling in at amantin soil augering late in delineated several anomalies which we plan to follow up in including deep auger sampling on a by meter grid followed by rab  rc and diamond drilling if warranted 
we expect to spend about million on exploration activities as the benso property in  with a further million at the hwini butre property 
we expect to complete and publish a feasibility study in the second quarter of for the development and mining of the hbb properties 
as of december  we have identified indicated mineral resources of million tonnes at an average gold grade of g t at the hbb properties 
akropong trend properties work continued on a reduced scale during on the akropong trend properties located approximately to kilometers to the west of bogoso prestea 
the objective of our efforts in this area is to identify additional mineral reserve opportunities in the immediate vicinity of bogoso prestea that could  in the future  provide additional sources of ore for the bogoso processing plants 
apart from the pampe deposit  where ore mining commenced in march  the other akropong trend projects are at an early stage of exploration 
to date they do not have  and ultimately might not have  proven and probable mineral reserves 
dunkwa properties in  we purchased two prospecting licenses  asikuma and mansiso  along the ashanti trend which we refer to as the dunkwa properties 
these properties cover kilometers of strike along the ashanti trend directly north of and contiguous with the current bogoso property 
they are accessible by ghanaian public roads 
the addition of the asikuma and mansiso 
table of contents prospecting licenses  which cover and square kilometers  respectively  increases our property holdings along the trend to over kilometers in length 
there are five known gold prospects on the dunkwa concession including mampon 
all of these occur in the same approximate stratigraphic position within lower birimian sediments from to kilometers west of the contact with the birimian metavolcanics 
these prospects are also associated with shearing and or graphitic faults  similar to those seen at bogoso and consist of narrow quartz veins with strong pyrite and arsenopyrite mineralization in the wall rocks ranging up to total sulfides 
one of the main targets along this trend is an unexplored nine kilometer section of the ashanti trend covered by opon river valley sediments which coincides with a conductivity anomaly 
attempts to drill this target commencing in early met with unexpected delays due to farmer s objections  however these problems now appear to have been resolved and drilling is expected to continue in spending in the dunkwa area totaled million in regional activities in ghana in  we commenced exploration on several early stage regional projects in southern ghana covering extensive areas to the east and south of the bogoso prestea and wassa areas see map at the beginning of item description of properties 
the initial wide spaced geochemical surveys identified promising gold and multi element anomalies which were followed up and further refined by additional sampling in work in is expected to involve initial auger and shallow drilling of the better anomalies leading to deeper drilling if warranted 
we are exploring several other early stage properties in ghana with programs planned to involve broad spaced reconnaissance sampling 
other exploration stage properties in africa mano river joint venture  sierra leone in late we entered into a joint venture agreement with mano river resources inc  which holds seven gold properties in sierra leone totaling approximately square kilometers 
a diamond core drilling program commenced in mid march at the yirisen prospect on the north pampana license  and holes were completed 
grades and gold mineralization proved to be variable and discontinuous 
however  due to the prospective nature of the local area  as evidenced by numerous artisanal workings and favorable geology  a reconnaissance soil sampling program was initiated over all the joint venture properties in late which continued into exploration during involved extensive programs of prospecting and in fill soil sampling to confirm and refine the initial anomalies 
this work has both confirmed the original anomalies and identified several new areas of anomalism associated with artisanal workings 
in late diamond drilling had recommenced on the yirisen trend at pampana and a rab drill has been mobilized from ghana to commence exploration beneath the thick laterite cover on the sonfon trend 
expenditures on the mano river joint venture in totaled with expenditures of million planned for afema  cote d ivoire in march  we entered into an option to purchase the afema project in c te d ivoire from the ivorian parastatal company soci t d etat pour le d veloppement minier de la c te d ivoire so 
de 
mi 
the afema property covers an area of  square kilometers of prospective birimian rocks in south east c te d ivoire which represent the southeastern extension of the sefwi belt meta volcanics and the kumasi basin meta sedimentary rocks 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we were entitled to carry out a six month detailed technical due diligence  after which we had the right to acquire of the property 
we undertook an intensive exploration program at afema during the six months following signing of the option  including the collection and analysis of over  soil samples and compilation and assessment of previous exploration data 
despite this work  we were unable to come to a definitive decision on the merits of the project and hence a six month extension to the option period was requested  which so 
de 
mi 
granted 
the extension was used to continue the assessment of previous data and to complete infill sampling and trenching of some of the better anomalies defined by the initial program  as well as a base line environmental study 
goulagou  burkina faso we hold an beneficial interest in the goulagou and adjoining rounga gold properties  which were acquired along with the hbb properties in late together the two contiguous properties cover approximately square kilometers and are located approximately kilometers west of ouagadougou  the capital city of burkina faso  and kilometers north of the 
table of contents city of ouahigouya 
drilling programs carried out by the prior owner and their predecessors identified several areas of gold enrichment including two parallel gold mineralized zones on the goulagou property the goulagou i and ii deposits 
work during has involved the collation and auditing of exploration data from all previous operators and its compilation into a coherent digital data base which is being used to review the effectiveness of past exploration and identify targets for ongoing work in deba and tialkam projects  niger the deba and tialkam properties are gold exploration properties in niger which were acquired along with the hbb properties in late we hold a interest in the two exploration permits  subject to the interest of the government of niger 
based on data obtained from exploration carried out by previous owners and the presence of artisanal workings  the prior owner initiated an rc drilling program in late  which we continued in early the results of this drilling were largely inconclusive 
our work during has involved the collation and auditing of exploration data from all previous operators and its compilation into a coherent digital database 
this is being used to review the effectiveness of past exploration and identify targets for ongoing work in exploration stage properties in south america saramacca property the saramacca project is located in suriname and is owned by golden star 
two successive soil auger sampling programs completed in and evaluated a series of stream sediment gold anomalies and defined a five kilometer long soil anomaly forming a series of en echelon zones 
deep augering in further confirmed the anomaly now termed anomaly m 
shallow diamond core drilling comprising holes for a total of  meters commenced at anomaly m in march this work was undertaken with a lightweight man portable drill rig due to the rugged terrain  limiting hole depths to less than meters 
mineralization intersected within drill cores consisted of variably sheared silicified pyritic metasediments of tuffaceous origin and volcanic conglomerates  often with little or no quartz veining 
significant gold assays were also intersected within the upper five to ten meters of enriched lateritic duricrust and mottled saprolite 
based on the encouraging results from the work  we planned to follow up with a second phase of deeper core drilling and a program of mechanized trenching in an attempt to elucidate the structure of the host rocks beneath the duricrust capping 
since exploration in this logistically difficult and high cost environment is likely to require a major commitment of funds  in august we entered into a joint venture agreement with a subsidiary of newmont mining corporation newmont to jointly explore this  square kilometer property 
under the terms of the agreement  newmont can earn a participating interest in the saramacca project by spending million over the first five years of the joint venture 
thereafter  newmont may elect to earn a further interest by completing a feasibility study  provided that i it does so within two years of earning  and ii golden star does not exercise its one time option to elect to contribute to maintain its equity interest 
standard dilution clauses apply if one or the other party does not contribute subsequent to newmont acquiring a interest 
further  if either party s interest is reduced to below by dilution  that party will be automatically assigned a net smelter royalty interest in the venture 
upon newmont completing a feasibility study  golden star may i 
elect to participate relative to its joint venture interest at that time  ii 
dilute its interest  or iii 
be assigned an automatic net smelter royalty interest in the venture 
additionally  if golden star elects to maintain its interest  it may elect to have newmont carry all golden star s share of mine development costs 
if this option is selected  golden star would repay newmont from of its share of eventual mine earnings plus interest at libor plus 
in addition  golden star will receive an advance royalty of per ounce of gold reported on the date that newmont approves development of a mine 
we retain management of the project for the initial two years or expenditure of million funded by newmont  whichever comes first 
joint operation began in late with an initial budget of million for the first twelve month period through to august the primary goal is to extend and infill anomaly m along strike to the southwest where it remains open ended and approximately  meters of diamond core drilling is planned for this 
the secondary goal of the program is to do regional reconnaissance to identify and sample artisanal mining sites in the area and to compile and reprocess existing data from previously flown regional aeromagnetics to provide a more refined picture of the geology and structure of the saramacca district 

table of contents bon espoir property the bon espoir property is located in french guiana and is owned by golden star 
it covers a sheared belt basin volcanic sediment contact zone analogous to those we are exploring in similar aged lower proterozoic terrains in ghana 
during  we conducted a regional soil sampling along much of the kilometer long sediment volcanic contact shear zone that hosts the wayamaga prospect drilled by previous owners of the bon espoir permit 
assay results identified coherent zones of anomalous low grade zones of gold and arsenic along the main wayamaga structural break  however the tenor of the anomalism was not strong enough to warrant immediate follow up 
we have filed an application to renew the permit with a reduced area covering the best of these anomalies 
paul isnard the paul isnard project is located in the western part of french guiana  some km west of cayenne 
the project covers rocks of the lower proterozoic paramacca formation which contain gold mineralization in the form of pyritic disseminated zones or stringer zones and sulfide rich shear zones  which can be reasonably correlated between the current widely spaced meter drill sections 
in early  we retained independent consultants rsg global to provide a ni compliant resource estimate for the montagne d or deposit on the southern boundary of the paul isnard concession  and to run pit optimization studies using a range of gold prices and mining costs prevailing at that time 
in late rsg global now coffey international re ran the pit optimizations using revised mining costs and gold prices 
using a gold price of per ounce  the montagne d or deposit was estimated to contain a ni compliant inferred in pit mineral resource of million tonnes grading g t 
further work may be warranted to identify additional sources of hard rock mineralization  which together with the mineral resource at montagne d or  could support a future mining operation 
exploration rights to guyanor s paul isnard property are optioned to golden star in an earn in agreement that provides golden star the right to acquire up to of the square kilometer property via a series of option payments and exploration spending 
benzdorp the four properties comprising the km benzdorp south gold project are located along the eastern border of suriname  approximately km southeast of paramaribo 
the benzdorp mining district is underlain by greenstones of the lower proterozoic paramacca formation and a felsic intrusive assemblage 
recorded and estimated alluvial gold production from historical dredging and present day small scale alluvial mining is in excess of  ounces 
our work during the mid s failed to identify economically viable mineralization 
consequently  in early our underlying option rights over the antino property were farmed out to reunion gold corporation in return for a minimum million expenditure plus periodic property payments over five years and a net smelter return to golden star 
minera irl minera irl is a private  junior exploration company active in peru  argentina and chile

minera irl has informed us that it intends to developed a portfolio of exploration projects  the most advanced of which  corihuarmi  located approximately km south east of lima near huancayo  is the most advanced 
corihuarmi  a high sulfidation vuggy silica style epithermal deposit  was drilled over the period to with encouraging results leading to completion of a feasibility study in development of the corihuarmi gold mine as a low cost open pit  heap leach operation based on ni compliant reserves at million tonnes grading grams of gold per tonne is expected to commence in other projects controlled by minera irl include the jag elito silver gold project in argentina which is in its pre feasibility study stage and the ollachea gold project in peru 
jag elito has over holes  m of drilling already completed by previous owners and offers the potential for fast tracking to production 
ollachea  which is being acquired from rio tinto represents an advanced gold project in what appears to be an emerging slate belt district

this summary is based on the current provisions of the canada united states income tax convention the treaty  income tax act canada the tax act  the regulations there under and all amendments to the tax act publicly proposed by the government of canada to the date hereof 
it is assumed that each such amendment will be enacted as proposed and there is no other relevant change in any governing law  although no assurance can be given in these respects 
limited liability corporations created under the limited liability company legislation of certain us states and treated as a partnership or disregarded entity under us tax law cannot access any of the benefits of the treaty as described in the paragraphs below 
dividends paid or credited by us to a holder of one or more common shares will be subject to canadian non resident withholding tax at the rate of 
under the treaty  the rate of withholding tax is reduced to of the gross amount of the dividend where the holder is a company that owns at least of the company s voting stock and beneficially owns the dividend  and in any other case 

table of contents under the tax act  a holder will not be subject to canadian tax on any capital gain realized on an actual or deemed disposition of a common share  including a deemed disposition at death  provided that he did not hold the common share as capital property used in carrying on a business in canada  and that neither he nor persons with whom he did not deal at arm s length  alone or together  owned or have an option or interest in or more of the issued shares of any class of stock at any time in the month period immediately preceding the disposition 
a holder who is liable under the tax act for canadian tax in respect of a capital gain realized on an actual or deemed disposition of a common share could be relieved under the treaty from such liability unless a the common share formed part of the business property of a permanent establishment or fixed base in canada that the holder has or had within the twelve month period preceding the disposition  or b the holder was an individual and i was resident in canada for months during any period of consecutive years preceding the disposition  and ii was resident in canada at any time during the ten years immediately preceding the disposition  and iii owned the common share when he ceased to be a resident of canada 
to the extent that no treaty relief is available  generally  one half of any capital gain realized by a holder in a taxation year must be included in the income of the holder for the year  and one half of any capital loss realized by a holder in a taxation year must be deducted from taxable capital gains realized by the holder in that year 
capital losses for a taxation year in excess of taxable capital gains for that year generally may be carried back and deducted in any of the three preceding taxation years or carried forward and deducted in any subsequent taxation year against net taxable capital gains realized in such years 
a holder is required to file a canadian income tax return if such holder disposes of a common share and the gain or loss is subject to tax in canada  based on the application of the rules outlined in the above paragraphs  even where the treaty applies to relieve the canadian tax liability 
this summary is of a general nature and is not intended  nor should it be construed  to be legal or tax advice to any particular shareholder 
shareholders should consult their own tax advisers as to the income and other tax consequences arising in their particular circumstances 
certain united states federal income tax considerations there are certain us federal income tax risks associated with investments in golden star 
holders of our common shares or warrants or options to purchase our common shares who are united states taxpayers should consider that we could be considered to be a passive foreign investment company pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
although we believe that we were not a pfic for and that we will not be a pfic for  and do not expect to become a pfic in the foreseeable future  the tests for determining pfic status depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will not be a pfic 
if we are a pfic for any year  any holder of our common shares or warrants or options to purchase our common shares who is a us person for us income tax purposes a us holder and whose holding period for those shares  warrants or options includes any portion of a year in which we are a pfic generally would be subject to a special adverse tax regime in respect of excess distributions 
excess distributions include certain distributions received on shares in a pfic in a taxable year 
gain recognized by a us holder on a sale or other transfer of warrant or options to purchase our shares including certain transfers that would otherwise be tax free would also generally be taxed as an excess distribution 
excess distributions are generally taxed at ordinary income rates and are subject to a nondeductible interest charge and to other adverse rules 
certain elections may sometimes be used to mitigate the adverse tax rules that apply to pfics the so called qef and mark to market  but these elections may accelerate the recognition of taxable income and may result in the recognition of ordinary income 
the qef and mark to market elections are not be available for us holders with respect to warrants or options to acquire our common shares 
additional adverse rules would apply to us holders of our common shares for any year in which we are a pfic and own or dispose of shares in another corporation that is also a pfic

this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes information available to march  our business through our subsidiaries we own a controlling interest in four significant gold properties in southern ghana in west africa bogoso prestea property  which is comprised of the adjoining bogoso and prestea surface mining leases bogoso prestea  prestea underground property prestea underground  wassa property wassa  and hwini butre and benso properties hbb properties 
in addition to these gold properties we hold various other exploration rights and interests and are actively exploring in a variety of locations in west africa and south america 
bogoso prestea is owned by our owned subsidiary golden star bogoso prestea limited gsbpl  formerly bogoso gold limited which was acquired in bogoso prestea produced and sold  ounces of gold during through another owned subsidiary  golden star wassa limited gswl  formerly wexford goldfields limited  we own the wassa gold mine located some kilometers east of bogoso prestea 
wassa produced and sold  ounces of gold in the prestea underground is located on the prestea property and consists of a currently inactive underground gold mine and associated support facilities 
gsbpl owns a operating interest in the prestea underground 
we have carried out exploration and engineering studies in recent years to determine if the underground mine can be reactivated on a profitable basis and we expect to complete in late  a feasibility study for the development and mining of certain areas of prestea underground 
through a owned canadian subsidiary we own the hbb properties in southwest ghana 
the hbb properties consist of the hwini butre and benso properties which together cover an area of square kilometers 
both properties contain undeveloped zones of gold mineralization 
the hwini butre and benso properties are located approximately and kilometers south of wassa  respectively based on the proposed haulage route 
the mineralized zones have been delineated through the efforts of the prior owner who conducted extensive exploration work from the mid s to we hold interests in several gold exploration projects in ghana and elsewhere in west africa including sierra leone  burkina faso  niger and cote d ivoire

there are material limitations associated with the use of such non gaap measures 
since these measures do not incorporate revenues  changes in working capital and non operating cash costs  they are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap 
changes in numerous factors including  but not limited to  mining rates  milling rates  gold grade  gold recovery  costs of labor  consumables and mine site general and administrative activities can cause these measures to increase or decrease 
we believe that these measures are the same as  or similar to the measures of other gold mining companies  but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in every instance 
ownership all figures and amounts in this item are shown on a basis  which represents our current beneficial interest in gold production and revenues 
once all capital has been repaid  the government of ghana will receive of any dividends distributed from the subsidiaries owning the bogoso prestea and wassa mines 

table of contents business strategy and development since  our business and development strategy has been focused primarily on the acquisition of producing and development stage gold properties in ghana and on the exploration  development and operation of these properties 
since  our exploration efforts have been focused on ghana  other west african countries and south america 
in line with our business strategy  we acquired bogoso in and have operated the bogoso cil processing plant since that time 
in  we acquired prestea and have been mining surface deposits at prestea since late in late  we acquired wassa and following completion of a feasibility study  constructed the new wassa cil processing plant which began commercial operation in april we are in the process of completing and commissioning the nominal million tonnes per year bogoso biox processing plant which uses the proprietary biox bio oxidation technology to treat refractory sulfide ore 
we have stockpiled about one million tonnes of refractory ore  and the bogoso biox processing plant is currently processing sulfide ore 
we expect to complete commissioning of the bogoso biox processing plant in march  and we expect that throughput and metallurgical recoveries will increase over the remainder of the bogoso biox processing plant is designed to expand annual processing through put at bogoso prestea from approximately million tonnes per annum to approximately million tonnes per annum 
achievement of this target is subject to numerous risks 
see the discussion of risk factors in item a of this form k 
in late  we acquired the hbb properties 
during we carried out geological  environmental and engineering studies to determine the economic feasibility of these undeveloped gold properties 
these studies are continuing into our overall objective since has been to grow our business to become a mid tier gold producer with an annualized production rate of approximately  ounces 
we anticipate reaching this production rate during once the bogoso biox processing plant has reached full production 
we continue to evaluate potential acquisition and merger opportunities that could further increase our annual gold production 
however we presently have no agreement or understanding with respect to any specific potential transaction 
significant trends and events during saramacca project joint venture with newmont in mid an agreement was reached between us and newmont to jointly explore the  square kilometer saramacca property in western suriname 
golden star retains management of the project for the initial two years or expenditure of million funded by newmont  whichever comes first 
joint operation began in late with an initial budget of million for the first twelve month period through to august illegal mining in october  the government of ghana  through its ministry of national security  initiated a country wide operation to remove illegal miners from legal mineral concessions in ghana 
illegal mining operations were widespread and occurred on the concessions of other mining companies in ghana as well as at bogoso prestea  wassa and hbb properties 
the action follows a long period of sensitization and education by the government  which included the introduction of improved mechanisms for these miners to apply for small scale mining permits in their own right  to mine on areas not already held by mining companies 
the government also conducted a public campaign to educate the illegal miners and the community on the short term and long term dangers of the illegal mining activities 
government and private security personnel have since maintained a presence on our bogoso and prestea mining properties and to date there have been no significant recurrence of illegal mining activities at bogoso prestea 
the government s actions have now allowed access to our properties south of prestea and we resumed exploration activities there in the fourth quarter of in anticipation of initiation of mining operations in there have been no material problems with illegal mining at wassa 
power restrictions in ghana since august  the volta river authority vra  the ghana government s subsidiary which controls ghanaian power supply  has rationed electric power to all power users in ghana  including the mining sector 
ghana s major power generating source  the akosombo hydroelectric power station on the volta river  has cut back its power output over the past several months due to historically low water levels in the akosombo reservoir which feeds the akosombo power plant 
rainfall over the last nine to twelve months has not been sufficient to restore the reservoir water levels to a point that would allow continuous unrestricted operations 

table of contents at the same time ghana s other power plant  the aboadze thermal power station  was operating at less than full capacity in late due to refurbishment of a major component of one of its turbines 
the repairs are now complete  but the aboadze plant is currently undergoing a conversion to a natural gas feed source and it is also expected to produce electricity at a reduced level through the first quarter of as requested by the vra  we have limited our usage of vra power at various times and in various amounts since august our cuts have been achieved by a combination of i reducing plant through put  ii limiting activities at the prestea underground mine  which has halted the rate of exploration  and iii operating our stand by diesel generating capacity 
by taking these actions we have been able to continue near normal operations at bogoso prestea and wassa but the high cost of fuel oil for our generators has contributed significantly to higher operating costs 
later in  if water inflows to the akosombo reservoir during the wet season are not at least at average levels  additional rationing may be required 
to this end  golden star  along with newmont mining corporation  gold fields limited and anglogold ashanti limited  have agreed to acquire a nominal megawatt power station 
the total expected cost to acquire and construct this power station is million  of which we will fund 
the power station is expected to be operational by mid our share of this power station will be a nominal megawatts  which is sufficient to provide up to of our total power requirements in ghana when the bogoso biox processing plant is fully commissioned 
we expect that this  combined with our diesel generators and power availability from the national grid  will be more than adequate to meet our total power requirements in including start up of the bogoso biox processing plant 
if there is inadequate rainfall in  we may be adversely affected by further rationing  which could increase our anticipated cash operating costs 
personnel changes vice president operations in june  we appointed colin belshaw as vice president operations 
mr

chief financial officer in february  tom mair was appointed as senior vice president and chief financial officer  replacing mr 
allan marter who resigned in late mr 
mair is a financial and accounting professional with more than years of international business experience in the natural resources industry 
prior to joining golden star  mr 
mair was employed by a major international gold mining company where he held positions as group financial executive  regional controller and as president director of a major international subsidiary 
other additions to management golden star expanded its management team by employing mark thorpe  vice president sustainability  peter bourke  vice president technical services  david partridge  general manager bogoso prestea  and ted strickler  vice president human resources and administration 
each of the new employees has extensive experience in his field of expertise 
golden star hired these employees as part of its continued focus on its strategic plan to become a mid tier producer 
sale of shares of moto goldmines limited in march  we exercised our remaining warrants to purchase million moto goldmines limited moto shares  bringing our total ownership in moto to six million common shares and immediately afterward sold all six million common shares in a bought deal transaction in canada for cdn per share 
the sale of the six million shares resulted in net proceeds to golden star of million cdn million 
the sale realized approximately million of pre tax capital gain for golden star  which was recognized in income in the first quarter of a million non cash tax expense was recognized on the gain 
gold prices gold prices have generally trended upward during the last five years  from a low of just under per ounce in early to a high of per ounce in may from may to december  the increase in gold prices flattened  averaging approximately per ounce for these eight months but then moved up to a high of per ounce in the first quarter of the realized gold price for our shipments during averaged per ounce  as compared to per ounce in 
table of contents bogoso sulfide expansion project the bogoso sulfide expansion project is designed to significantly expand processing capacity at bogoso prestea 
current production of million tonnes per annum  from the bogoso cil processing plant  will be increased to a projected total capacity of approximately million tonnes per annum from both plants once the bogoso biox processing plant is operational 
the bogoso biox processing plant will utilize the biox bio oxidation process marketed by a subsidiary of gold fields limited 
gold field s biox technology is currently being used in eleven gold processing plants operating or under development worldwide 
upon completion  our bogoso biox processing plant will be the largest operating biox plant in the world 
the new crusher  ball mill  sag mill and the cil circuit was tested late in the fourth quarter of using non refractory ore 
non refractory ore feed was discontinued in mid february and the ball mill  sag mill  and cil circuit as well as biox module are now in a test and commissioning phase using sulfide ore 
the first inoculate was introduced to the biox tanks in november and all seven biox tanks in biox module were filled with inoculate in february biox module is expected to come on line by the end of march 
we expect the first gold production for the biox plant in march pre stripping of the sulfide pits to create a stockpile of transition and sulfide ore for the bogoso biox processing plant is progressing well 
approximately million tonnes of ore is currently exposed in the sulfide pits and approximately million tonnes has been moved to ore stockpiles 
pampe ore body final approval of the pampe environmental impact study was received in november and first ore was mined and delivered to the bogoso cil processing plant in march initial production will be carried out under a bulk sampling permit 
application has been made for a mining permit 
the pampe ore body will provide oxide ore feed to the existing bogoso cil processing plant 
completion of mining at plant north pit mining was completed at the plant north pit in december reclamation work  including partial back filling  is scheduled during sale of euro shares and change in accounting for euro at march  we owned of euro s outstanding common shares and as such consolidated euro s financial results with our own 
during the second quarter of we sold  of our euro shares in open market transactions realizing approximately million of cash 
on june  we sold an additional four million euro shares in a private transaction receiving million of cash 
the purchasers of the four million shares have agreed to pay additional consideration to golden star if they sell the shares at a gain 
since our investment in euro s shares was carried at zero basis  a gain was recognized on sale of the shares in an amount essentially equal to the cash proceeds received 
the combined share sales during the second quarter diluted our holding in euro s common shares to approximately 
in response to a reduced ownership position  the equity method of accounting was adopted on june  for our remaining interest in euro 
under the equity accounting method  our consolidated financial statements no longer include euro s assets and liabilities 
the net effect of the change in accounting method resulted in recognition of an additional million of gain 
total gain from the change in our euro ownership position  consisting of million from the sale of shares and million from the change in accounting method  totaled million 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold an additional million of our euro common shares in a series of public and private transactions  bringing our euro ownership position down to approximately by december  net proceeds of the sale totaled approximately million 
since our basis in the euro shares was nil  the gain on share sale was equal to the million we received 
following this sale golden star owned approximately million of euro s common shares as of december  subsequent to year end  we sold an additional million euro shares in open market transactions for net proceeds of approximately million  reducing our ownership to approximately million shares or of euro s outstanding equity 
we continue to hold a right to receive from euro a portion of euro s future royalties from iamgold corporation s rosebel mine in suriname on production exceeding two million but less than seven million ounces 
the sale of euro shares was in line with the goals and objectives originally envisaged in the euro restructuring plan 
the goal of the restructuring plan was to establish euro as an independent and economically viable entity that would not be dependent on golden star for funding and that would concurrently bring value to golden star s investment 

table of contents reduced gold derivatives at the end of december our derivative positions included  call options at a per ounce strike price and  puts with a per ounce strike price 
all of these calls and puts were closed or expired during the first quarter of as a result of the sale of euro shares on june  see above  golden star is no longer required to consolidate the financial statements of euro as of that date 
therefore the euro derivative contract liabilities and associated impact on earnings have not been included in our consolidated financial statements after june  debt facilities in october  our subsidiary gsbpl drew down million on a debt facility provided by two ghana based commercial banks  ecobank ghana limited and cal bank limited 
the funds are available for a term of months at an interest rate of us prime plus 
the current rate is set at 
loan fees total of the facility amount 
the loan is repayable in equal installments starting january the debt is secured by the non mobile assets of the bogoso prestea mine and proceeds are to be used as partial funding for the bogoso sulfide expansion project 
there are no hedging requirements or equity type incentives required under the facility 
improved operating margins as discussed in more detail below  the operating margins gold sales revenues less total mine operating costs at both wassa and bogoso prestea trended upward during higher gold prices and higher gold output were the major factors contributing to the improvements at the bogoso plant 
wassa benefited from a combination of improved operating costs  higher ore grades from the new sak pit and improved gold prices 
subsequent events equity offering on march   we sold million common shares at a price of per share resulting in million in gross proceeds 
net proceeds were million after deducting underwriting commissions but before deducting offering expenses 
on march  the underwriters exercised their option to sell an additional million common shares for additional gross proceeds of million 
after deducting the underwriter s commission  net proceeds were million 
the proceeds will be used to purchase an interest in an electric power station in ghana  for completion and start up of the bogoso sulfide expansion project  for a feasibility study and if warranted  development of the hbb properties  and for general corporate and working capital purposes 
on february  warrants to purchase million common shares at a strike price of cdn expired 
results of operations compared to net income totaled million or per share in the twelve months ended december   versus a net loss of million or per share in while mining operations contributed million dollars to the pre tax income in versus a deficit of in  the major factor contributing to the million improvement in earnings was sales during of non core assets including our holdings of euro and moto shares 
a million pre tax gain was recognized in the first quarter of on the sale of our moto shares 
in the second quarter of a million pre tax gain was recognized upon the sale of million shares of euro and upon the resultant change in accounting method see significant trends and events above for additional information on the moto and euro share sales

the improvement in the operating margin over is mostly due to improved gold prices 
while the number of ounces of gold sold during was essentially unchanged from  consolidated gold revenues rose by million to million 
approximately million of the increase is related to wassa s revenues in the first quarter of versus zero revenues in the first quarter of when wassa was still in its construction phase 
the remaining increase in gold revenues was related to improvements in gold prices during gold prices averaged per ounce during versus per ounce in 
table of contents total mine operations costs  as found on the statement of operations  increased to million  up from million in most of the increase reflects the fact that wassa was in service for a full twelve months in but for only for nine months in higher depreciation in versus also reflects the increased ounces produced at wassa and increases in mining equipment fleet at bogoso 
the increase in general and administrative expenses reflects an overall increase in our activities including additions to the management team and the establishment of an internal audit function 
higher share based compensation costs also contributed to the increase in g a in interest expense dropped in because higher construction costs related to the bogoso sulfide expansion project led to an increase in the amount of interest capitalized 
most of the foreign exchange gains were generated from cash held in canada early in following a december equity offering 
bogoso prestea operations compared to bogoso prestea generated a million operating margin during on sales of  ounces of gold  up from a million operating margin on sales of  ounces in the major factor contributing to the improved margin at bogoso prestea was a improvement in realized gold prices from per ounce in to per ounce in this was offset by a  ounce decrease in gold production in lower ore grade from the plant north pit and lower plant through put due to harder ores from deeper levels in the plant north pit were the major factors responsible for the lower gold output 
bogoso prestea operating results ore mined t plant north pit waste mined t plant north pit ore processed t grade processed g t recovery gold sales oz cash operating cost oz royalties oz total cash cost oz in addition to the gold production shown above   ounces of gold were recovered during testing and commissioning of the new bogoso biox plant crushing  grinding and cil circuits 
the bogoso cil processing plant processed an average of  tonnes per day in at an average grade of grams per tonne  as compared to  tonnes per day at grams per tonne in the same period in gold recovery decreased slightly to from during mostly due to the lower grade ore 
bogoso prestea s total cash costs decreased from million in to million in mainly due to reduced stripping rates as the plant north pit neared the end of its life 
while the actual spending was lower during  lower gold production led to an increase in costs per ounce resulting in a cash operating cost of per ounce versus per ounce in wassa operations compared to since wassa was in operation for only nine months in versus a full twelve months in  the operating results are not easily comparable 
while wassa s operating margins in the last nine months of were positive and improved in each quarter of  the total operating margin loss for the year was million 
this was a significant improvement over the million operating margin loss in the nine months of the wassa cil processing plant averaged  tonnes per day at an average grade of grams per tonne with a gold recovery of during  versus  tonnes per day at an average grade of grams per tonne and a recovery rate of in the nine months of cash operating costs averaged per ounce in or above total cash costs averaged per ounce during or over the level 
the increase in the average daily processing rate reflects 
table of contents correction of plant design defects encountered early in the wassa cil processing plant s life

during  wassa s operating costs remained higher than expected and at the same time ore grades were lower than expected 
at december  wassa s reserves were re estimated based on historical costs and ore grades encountered during and as a result  wassa s proven and probable mineral reserves dropped to  ounces at the end of  or approximately  ounces less than would have been expected after subtracting the ounces consumed by processing operations during the carrying value of the assets in respect of the wassa mine was million as at december  the valuation of the wassa mine is highly sensitive to assumptions regarding the price of gold and the number of ounces expected to be produced 
as at december   the impairment analysis incorporated the following key assumptions gold prices per ounce of in  in  in  and in and approximately one third of the non reserve resources would eventually be found economic and would be mined and processed 
based on these assumptions  the wassa mine was not impaired based on the projected undiscounted cash flows of the mine 
other gains and losses derivatives the million in mark to market loss was a result of the impact of higher gold prices on euro s forward gold price agreements a loss of before tax of million  golden star s gold calls a loss of million  and rand forwards a loss of million as discussed above  after june   we no longer recognized gains and losses on euro s forward gold price agreements 
interest the drop in interest expense in is a function of larger amounts of interest capitalized at the bogoso sulfide expansion project during based on continued expenditures on that project in foreign exchange gains the majority of the foreign exchange gains earned in are related to canadian dollar accounts that held the proceeds of a december equity offering 
results of operations compared to we incurred a net loss of million or per share on revenues of million during versus net income of million or per share on revenues of million during while gold revenues in were million higher than in  due mostly to production from our new wassa mine and from higher realized gold prices  operating costs were million higher  also due mostly to costs from wassa and increased costs at bogoso prestea 
the major factors contributing to the million swing in operating results include a million operating loss at wassa  a million reduction in operating income at bogoso prestea on lower gold production and higher operating costs and a million unrealized  non cash mark to market adjustment for the euro derivatives 
in addition  a million increase in interest expense and million of impairment write offs of exploration properties were partially offset by a million reduction in corporate development costs  a million increase in royalty income and a million gain from sale of common shares by our subsidiary euro 
recognition of a million tax asset at euro  the recognition of a million tax asset related to the sale of moto shares and a million increase in tax assets at gsbpl reduced our net loss by 
table of contents million 
realized gold prices averaged per ounce during  a increase from the per ounce realized in bogoso prestea operations compared to bogoso prestea generated million of after tax operating income during on sales of  ounces of gold  down from million of after tax operating income on sales of  ounces in the major factors contributing to s lower earnings were lower gold sales and increases in operating costs 
gold production was down  ounces in versus due to a combination of lower plant through put and lower gold recovery  both of which were caused by the metallurgical characteristics of the deeper  harder non refractory sulfide plant north ores processed in versus the shallower and softer oxide and non refractory sulfide ores milled in the first five months of benefited from the oxide ores processed in that period which yield higher mill throughput rates  better recovery and lower operating costs than did the transition and non refractory sulfide ores processed during processing of low grade stock pile material in september and october  during the epa s requested mining stoppage  also contributed to the decrease in ounces of gold sold 
mining costs in increased million at bogoso prestea versus increases in fuel and labor charges accounted for approximately half of the increase in costs 
the balance of the increase was a combination of higher costs for supplies and consumables  including explosives  ore haulage contracts  drilling supplies  grinding balls  maintenance and tires 
the bogoso cil processing plant processed an average of  tonnes per day in at an average grade of grams per tonne  as compared to  tonnes per day at grams per tonne in the same period in gold recovery dropped to in from in the higher recovery in was a function of the oxide ore processed in the first half of the lower gold output and higher mine operating costs in resulted in a significant increase in unit costs 
cash operating costs averaged per ounce in  compared to per ounce in  and total cash costs averaged per ounce in  up from per ounce in wassa operations compared to the wassa operating results discussed below are for the nine month period following wassa s april  in service date 
there was no production from wassa in wassa generated a million after tax operating loss in the nine months ended december  on sales of  ounces of gold 
cash operating costs averaged per ounce and total cash costs averaged per ounce 
the wassa cil processing plant processed an average of  tonnes per day at an average grade of grams per tonne with a gold recovery of 
overall  wassa s operating results were disappointing in we had anticipated higher mill through put  higher grades  and lower operating costs than those achieved 
operating costs were adversely impacted early in the year by high power costs from our diesel fired  on site power plant 
this was remedied by late june when wassa was connected to the national power grid 
mining costs were also higher than expected early in the year as we utilized contract miners and used smaller than optimal  rented mining equipment 
by the end of we had completed the acquisition of our own fleet of new nominal tonne haulage trucks and hydraulic loaders 
we expect that the lower power costs and more efficient mining equipment should lead to lower costs during several design bottlenecks were discovered at the processing plant during wassa s first nine months of operations and certain improvements were made during the year  but at year end we were still dealing with frequent plant blockages mostly related to the high clay content of the weathered  near surface ores mined and processed in by the end of we had mined to sufficient depth in the pit to access fresher ores which have lower clay content and which we expect will reduce some of the plant blockage problems in the future 
as a result we expect better mill throughput in finally  as we progress deeper into the fresh ore we expect the ore grades to improve 
the higher grades are also expected to help achieve higher gold recovery rates 
derivatives the million in unrealized  non cash mark to market losses were mostly a result of the impact of higher gold prices on euro s forward gold price agreements a loss before tax of million  golden star s calls a loss of million  and puts a loss of million 
our euro currency accounts lost million 
a million mark to market gain on the forward rand positions partially offset the put  call and euro losses 
euro also recognized a million reduction in royalty revenues for cash payments made related to its derivative positions  such payments being related to increases in gold prices during the year 
interest the increase in interest expense is a function of increased balances on equipment financing loans  euro s bank loans and interest on the million of convertible notes sold during in addition to the interest expense shown on the consolidated statement of operations  million of interest was capitalized as part of the bogoso sulfide expansion project 

table of contents other revenues and costs the operating and non operating losses and higher costs were partly offset by a million increase in royalty income from the rosebel royalty related to higher gold prices and increased output from cambior inc s rosebel mine 
the increase in the royalty also reflects the fact that the rosebel mine and its associated royalty did not commence production until near the end of the first quarter in  yielding only a partial year of operations in corporate development charges in were down from when we incurred million of expense in an unsuccessful merger attempt 
development projects bogoso sulfide expansion project approximately of the remaining ore reserves at bogoso prestea are refractory and cannot be efficiently processed at our existing bogoso cil processing plant 
in a decision was made to construct the new million tonne per annum bogoso biox processing plant alongside the existing million tonne per annum bogoso cil processing plant 
the new processing plant utilizes the proprietary biox bio oxidation technology to treat the refractory sulfide ore 
upon completion in april  the new bogoso biox processing plant and the existing bogoso cil processing plant are together expected to process million tonnes of ore per year 
the existing bogoso cil processing plant will retain its current configuration and will continue to process non refractory ores and the new bogoso biox processing plant will process mostly refractory sulfide ore and mixed oxide refractory ores 
the two plants sitting side by side are expected to provide operational efficiencies since they will share common management  labor  reagent inventories  warehouse parts and maintenance efforts 
with the two plants and their differing technologies  we expect to be able to process all of the ore types known to exist in the bogoso prestea area 
the expansion project is progressing well and the bacteria in biox module are performing as expected 
the first biox module is expected to be fully commissioned by the end of february and biox module should be on line by the end of march  providing benefit from the expansion project in the last three quarters of the new crusher  ball mill  sag mill and carbon in leach circuit underwent testing and commissioning using oxide ore in the fourth quarter of and on into february on february  we initiated primary commissioning with refractory ore  processing sulfide ores to feed the new bogoso biox processing plant 
extensive pre stripping was carried out at the first two sulfide pits during the second half of pre stripping consists of million tonnes of waste and million tonne of ore to december  in addition  million tonnes of ore has been exposed in the sulfide pits 
project costs at december  were as follows project costs to december  are as follows as of december  plant construction cost mining equipment cost pre production stripping cost sub total costs prior to project commencement capitalized interest total exploration projects total expenditures for all exploration and drilling activities in were million  down from million in during we plan to continue our exploration efforts to identify exploration opportunities and new resources in africa  south america and elsewhere 
the main exploration focus in was to build on our resources and reserves around our existing mining operations at bogoso prestea and wassa  progressing our advanced properties in south west ghana towards development decisions and exploring the prestea underground deposit 
exploration in ghana during our exploration in ghana focused on confirming and upgrading resources at our hbb properties  advancing this project towards a development decision and progressing our various early stage projects to a drilling stage 
the ghana exploration activities totaled approximately million and accounted for approximately of our exploration spending and included drilling of the father brown  adiokrom  subriso east  subriso west  and the benso g i zones at the benso property 
studies to determine the best development options for these deposits are currently in progress  drilling beneath the plant north pit and prestea south deposits at prestea to investigate their near surface and shallow decline access potential  and 
table of contents drilling of the prestea west reef system between and levels to provide a major upgrade in the resources within this area  and commencement of drilling below prestea level to investigate the continuity and grade of the down plunge extensions of the historically mined shoots 
exploration elsewhere in africa exploration continued on our mano river joint venture in sierra leone  with in fill soil sampling programs more tightly defining extensive zones of gold anomalism on the pampana and sonfon properties preparatory to drill testing in we also conducted early stage exploration on several newly acquired properties in c te d ivoire and continued assessment of data from our more advanced afema c te d ivoire  goulagou burkina faso and deba tialkam niger properties 
exploration on the guiana shield due to similarities in the geology and ages of the rocks  we consider the guiana shield in the northeast corner of south america as a geological extension of the west african shield where our ghanaian properties are located 
encouraging results from a limited diamond core drilling program conducted at our saramacca property in suriname during allowed us to attract major joint venture exploration funding from newmont gold corporation commencing in late drilling under this golden star managed joint venture is expected to recommence in once we have better defined the target zone at the laterite covered anomaly m through the combined application of detailed geochemistry and geophysics 
see significant trends and events section above for additional details of the joint venture 
opportunities we have budgeted million for exploration in  and intend to focus our efforts on core assets in ghana  including the hbb properties 
key areas where we plan to be active include complete drilling of the decline accessible prestea main reef foot wall target below the plant north pit so that a pre feasibility study followed by a feasibility study can commence  advance exploration of the known oxide targets in the prestea south area to allow feasibility and permitting to be completed by end  and test the strike and down dip extensions of existing mineralization at the hbb properties and continue testing of new target areas 
while we continue to believe that the prestea underground represents a major discovery opportunity it is unlikely that exploration at depth will recommence until the two main shafts servicing the deeper levels have been repaired 
this is unlikely to be completed until late in at the earliest 
other opportunities include saramacca anomaly m in suriname  where we plan to follow up the encouraging drilling in our joint venture with newmont  and sierra leone where we plan to commence drilling of the promising new soil anomalies on the pampana and sonfon properties 
liquidity and capital resources while cash flows from operations totaled million in  million was committed to new ore stockpiles during the year 
this compares to million of cash from operations in the increase is mostly related to improved gold prices 
financing activities provided net cash of million during a total of million of additional equipment financing was drawn during to cover the cost of new mining equipment 
in october a million medium term bank loan was drawn down by gsbpl 
option exercises contributed an additional million in debt repayment consumed million of cash in the year mostly related to the equipment financing facility 
capital assets and capital projects including deferred exploration  new mining equipment and our major development projects used million during the year of which approximately million was spent on the bogoso sulfide expansion project 
additionally approximately million was spent on replacement equipment and mine development at bogoso 
table of contents and wassa including mine site drilling projects and million was spent on deferred exploration projects in west africa and in south america 
sales of our share holdings in moto goldmines ltd 
and euro ressources sa yielded million of cash during our cash and cash equivalent balance stood at million at december   down from million at the end of most of the reduction in cash balance was related to construction and development spending on the new sulfide expansion project at bogoso 
at december   working capital was million  versus million at the end of liquidity outlook in march we received net proceeds of million of cash from an equity offering 
we believe that the proceeds from the equity offering  plus cash on hand at december  and expected cash flow from operations in will be sufficient to cover all of our cash needs during including completion of the bogoso sulfide expansion project  our contribution to the new power plant and development of the hbb properties if the feasibility study shows it to be economically viable 
we expect to make payments of principle and interest totaling million during on equipment financing loans and we expect to draw an additional million on new equipment financing loans from the same facility 
interest and principle on our bank loan is expected to total million and we plan to pay approximately million of interest on our convertible notes which mature in april as shown in the table below we expect to invest a total of million during in exploration  ongoing mine development and mining equipment 
the hbb properties are not included in the spending totals shown below pending completion of the feasibility study 
we currently estimate the hbb development costs to be approximately million spread over late and early this estimate assumes that we use contract mining  and if we decide to use owner mining an additional million would be required for mining equipment 
currently forecasted capital expenditures plans for include the following projects amount capital spending budget for millions deferred exploration completion of the bogoso sulfide expansion project sustaining capital wassa sustaining capital bogoso power plant mine development operating mines mine development developing mines mine equipment developing mines prestea underground development total looking ahead our main objectives for include completion of construction and commissioning of the bogoso sulfide expansion project by the end of the first quarter of  commencement of oxide ore mining from the pampe deposit on the akropong trend west of bogoso  to provide oxide ore to the bogoso plant by march  permitting and commencement of oxide mining from prestea south ore bodies to provide oxide ore to the bogoso plant in the second half of completion of a feasibility study on the hbb properties by the end of march and commencement of project development by mid  completion of a feasibility study on the west reef underground deposit by the end of and continued evaluation of the prestea underground potential  optimization of our mining and processing activities at bogoso prestea and wassa  
table of contents a continued high level of exploration effort  and continuation of efforts to identify and pursue acquisition and growth opportunities in ghana and elsewhere 
we expect to produce and sell  ounces of gold at bogoso prestea during at an average cash operating cost of per ounce 
we expect wassa to produce approximately  ounces during at an average cash operating cost of approximately per ounce 
as more fully disclosed in the risk factors item a above  numerous factors could cause our estimates and expectations to be wrong or could lead to changes in our plans 
under any of these circumstances  the estimates described above could change materially

jude at march  critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements reflect the application of cdn gaap  which is different in certain material respects from us gaap 
the accounting policies reflected therein are generally those applied by similarly situated mining companies in canada 
our accounting policies under cdn gaap are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that can affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
accounting policies relating to asset impairments  depreciation and amortization of mining property  plant and equipment  tax assets and site reclamation closure accruals are subject to estimates and assumptions regarding reserves  gold recoveries  future gold prices  future operating and reclamation costs and future mining activities 
decisions to write off  or not to write off  all or a portion of our investment in various properties  especially exploration properties  subject to impairment analysis  are based on our judgment as to the actual value of the properties and are therefore subjective in most cases 
we have written off substantially all of our pre investments in exploration properties based upon our assessments of the amounts recoverable from these properties 
additional exploration properties have been found to be impaired and were written off in  and we continue to retain title to certain properties after impairment write offs as future events and discoveries may ultimately prove that they have value 
listed below are the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are critical to our financial statements based on the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset  liability  revenue or expense being reported 
ore stockpiles stockpiles represent coarse ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing 
stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tonnes of ore added and removed from the stockpile  the number of contained ounces based on assay data  and the estimated recovery percentage based on the expected processing method 
stockpiles are valued based on mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore  including a share of direct overhead and applicable depreciation  depletion and amortization relating to mining operations 
costs are added to a stockpile based on current mining costs and are removed at the average mining cost per tonne for material processed 
stockpiles are reduced as material is removed and fed to the mill 
a adjustment of the stockpile value  based on stockpile levels at the end of  would change the carrying value of the stockpile inventory by approximately million 
impairment charges we periodically review and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable from continued operation of the asset 
an asset impairment is considered to exist if the sum of all estimated future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  are 
table of contents less than the carrying value of the long lived asset 
the determination of expected future cash flows requires numerous estimates about the future  including gold prices  operating costs  gold recovery  reclamation spending  ore reserves and capital expenditures 
a review of bogoso prestea s and wassa s expected future cash flows as of december  indicated that there are no impairments 
mining properties mining properties recorded on our financial records are amortized using a units of production method over proven and probable mineral reserves 
reserve estimates  which serve as the denominator in units of production amortization calculations  involve the exercise of subjective judgment and are based on numerous assumptions about future operating costs  future gold prices  continuity of mineralization  future gold recovery rates  spatial configuration of gold deposits  and other factors that may prove to be incorrect 
a adjustment in estimated reserves could result in an approximately to million annual change in amortization expense 
tax assets recognition of future tax assets requires an analysis of future taxable income expectations to evaluate the probability of sufficient future taxable income to utilize the accrued tax benefits 
determination of expected future taxable income requires numerous estimates of future variable including but not limited to  gold prices  operating costs  gold recovery  ore reserves  gold production  ore grades  administrative costs  tax rates  and potential changes in tax laws 
asset retirement obligation and reclamation expenditures accounting for reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates at each mining operation of reclamation and closure costs to be incurred in the future as required to complete the reclamation and environmental remediation work mandated by existing laws  regulations and customs 
actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated 
additionally  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required 
based upon our current situation  we estimate that a increases in total future reclamation and closure costs would result in an approximately million increase in our asset retirement obligations 
recent accounting pronouncements section comprehensive income this section introduces new disclosure requirements regarding comprehensive income and its components  as well as net income  in the financial statements 
as a consequence  certain unrealized gains and losses  which would otherwise be excluded from the calculation of net income and be assigned directly to shareholders equity  will be used to calculate comprehensive income 
this section will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after october  we adopted this new requirement on january  section financial instruments recognition and measurement this section determines the time and value at which a financial instrument must be recorded in the balance sheet 
in some cases  it may be measured at fair value or  in other cases  at cost 
the standard also provides for the manner in which gains and losses related to financial instruments are to be recorded 
this section will be effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning on or after october  we adopted this new requirement on january  section hedges this section provides guidance for hedge accounting when applied to certain derivatives that meet the definition of a hedge 
application of section to derivatives that qualify as a hedges is optional  but once a derivative is classified as a hedge  the provisions of section are then mandatory 
section replaces acg  hedging relationships and completes the provisions of section  foreign currency translation  by addressing how to account for hedges and related disclosure of information requirements 
this section will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after october  we adopted this new requirement on january  section financial instruments disclosure and presentation replaces section  financial instruments disclosure and presentation  and establishes the requirements for presentation and disclosure of financial instruments and non financial derivatives 
eic on march   the cica emerging issues committee eic issued eic stripping costs incurred in the production phase of a mining operation this eic requires stripping costs to be accounted for as variable production costs to be included in inventory unless the stripping activity can be shown to be a betterment of the mineral property  in which case the stripping costs would be capitalized 
a betterment occurs when stripping activity increases future output of the mine by providing access to additional sources of reserves 
capitalized stripping costs would be amortized on a units of production basis over the proven and probable mineral reserves to which they relate 
as at december   we do not have any deferred stripping costs capitalized

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk includes  but is not limited to  the following risks changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio and debt  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity price fluctuations and equity price risk 
interest rate risk from time to time we invest excess cash in high quality short term debt instruments 
the rates received on such investments may fluctuate with changes in economic conditions 
as a result  our investment income may fall short of expectations during periods of lower interest rates 
we estimate that  given the cash balances expected during  a change in interest rates would not materially impact our annual income 
we have not entered into any agreements to hedge against unfavorable changes in interest rates  but may in the future actively manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk while our major operating units transact most of their business in us dollars  many purchases of labor  operating supplies and capital assets are denominated in euros  british pounds  australian dollars  south african rand and ghanaian cedi 
as a result  currency exchange fluctuations may impact the costs incurred at our operations 
gold is sold throughout the world based principally on the us dollar price  but portions of our operating expenses and some of our capital purchases are incurred in currencies other than the us dollar 
the appreciation of non us dollar currencies against the us dollar increases production costs and the cost of capital assets in us dollar terms at mines located outside the us  which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows 
conversely  a depreciation of non us dollar currencies usually decreases production costs and capital asset purchases in us dollar terms 

table of contents the value of cash and cash equivalent investments denominated in foreign currencies also fluctuates with changes in currency exchange rates 
appreciation of non us dollar currencies results in a foreign currency gain on such investments and a decrease in non us dollar currencies results in a loss 
while in the past we have not utilized market risk sensitive instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates  during and we entered into forward purchase contracts for the south african rand and euros to hedge expected future purchases of capital assets in south africa and europe associated mostly with the bogoso sulfide expansion project 
we also hold portions of our cash reserves in non us dollar currencies 
we held no forward purchase contracts as of december  commodity price risk gold is our primary product and  as a result  changes in the price of gold could significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows 
according to current estimates  a per ounce change in our average realized price of gold for would result in a million change in pre tax earnings and cash flows 
during and  to reduce the risk of unfavorable gold price fluctuations on our operating cash flows during the construction period of the bogoso sulfide expansion project  we purchased puts to lock in minimum gold prices for portions of our expected gold sales in  and as of december  we have  put options remaining which establish an average minimum price of per ounce on  ounces of expected gold production spread monthly through the first quarter of we also sold calls during to offset a portion of the costs of purchasing the puts 
at december  we had  call options remaining which expire during the first quarter of  each carrying a strike price of per ounce 
equity price risk we have in the past and may in the future seek to acquire additional funding by sale of common shares 
movements in the price of our common shares have been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future 
as a result  there is a risk that we may not be able to sell new common shares at an acceptable price should the need for new equity funding arise
