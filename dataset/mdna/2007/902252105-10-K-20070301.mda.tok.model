overview we provide integrated information management solutions and services for local governments 
we develop and market a broad line of software products and services to address the information technology it needs of cities  counties  schools and other local government entities 
in addition  we provide professional it services to our customers  including software and hardware installation  data conversion  training and for certain customers  product modifications  along with continuing maintenance and support for customers using our systems 
we also provide property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions 
our products are generally grouped into four major areas financials  courts and justice  property appraisal and tax  and document management 
we monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance 
these indicators include the following revenues we derive our revenues from four primary sources sale of software licenses  software services  appraisal services  and maintenance and support 
because the majority of the software we sell is off the shelf  increased sales of software products generally result in incrementally higher gross margins 
thus  the most significant driver to our business is the number and size of software license sales 
in addition  new software license sales generally generate implementation services revenues as well as future maintenance and support revenues  which we view as a recurring revenue source 
we also monitor our customer base and churn since our maintenance and support revenue should increase due to our historically low customer turnover 
cost of revenues and gross margins our primary cost component is personnel expenses in connection with providing software implementation and appraisal services to our customers 
we can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base  especially from those products and services that produce incremental revenue with minimal incremental cost  such as software licenses and maintenance and support 
our appraisal projects are seasonal in nature  and we often employ appraisal personnel on a short term basis to coincide with the life of a project 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the primary components of sg a expense are administrative and sales personnel salaries and commissions  marketing expense  research and development costs  rent and professional fees 
sales commissions generally fluctuate with revenues but other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues  however  these costs have recently grown disproportionately because of the requirements of corporate governance legislation 
research and development costs fluctuate from year to year depending on product development activity 

table of contents liquidity and cash flows the primary driver of our cash flows is net income 
uses of cash include acquisitions  capital investments in software development and property and equipment and the discretionary purchases of treasury stock 
during we used cash of million to acquire two small companies and certain maintenance and support agreements 
in  we also purchased million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cash purchase price of million 
our working capital needs are fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being payment of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable and cash receipts from customers in advance of revenue being earned 
balance sheet cash  accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred revenue balances are important indicators of our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues  cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to intangible assets  bad debts and our service contracts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants  and in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on our appraisal services contracts using the proportionate performance method of accounting  with considerations for the provisions of emerging issue task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
our revenues are derived from sale of software licenses  appraisal services  maintenance and support  and services that typically range from installation  training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs 
for multiple element software arrangements  which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and non refundable claim 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments  which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized 
because most of our customers are governmental entities  we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments 
in a limited number of cases  we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service  and we may offer a concession to such customer 
in those limited situations where we grant a concession  we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee  but alternatively may perform additional services  such as additional training or programming a minor feature the customer had in their prior software solution 
these amounts have historically been considered nominal 
in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion  our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis 
also  we review  on at least a quarterly basis  significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision  include  but are not limited to  deterioration of a customer s financial condition  failure to manage our customer s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered  and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 
for those software arrangements that involve significant production  modification or customization of the software  which is considered essential to its functionality  and for substantially all real estate appraisal outsourcing projects  we recognize revenue and profit as the work progresses using the percentage of completion method and the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition 
these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue  billings and collections and expected contract costs  as well as measures of progress toward completion 
we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
at times  we perform additional and or non contractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations 
if changes occur in delivery  productivity or other factors used in developing our 
table of contents estimates of expected costs or revenues  we revise our cost and revenue estimates  and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known 
we use contract accounting  primarily the percentage of completion method  and apply the provisions of sop no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts for those software arrangements that involve significant production  modification or customization of the software  or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software 
in addition  we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects  some of which can range up to three years 
in connection with these and certain other contracts  we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable and or payable pursuant to the contract 
the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 
in connection with certain of our contracts  we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date 
many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period 
management reviews unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue 
in addition  we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned 
the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings in which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period  generally one year 
we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met 
on a periodic basis  we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 
intangible assets and goodwill 
our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances  and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense  as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value  with the excess allocated to goodwill 
accordingly  we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets  including software  customer related intangibles  trade name and goodwill 
in addition  we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility 
these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
all intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of goodwill is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its fair value  generally determined by estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
recoverability of other intangible assets is generally measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used  or a significant adverse change in the business climate 
in addition  products  capabilities  or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or non competitive 
share based compensation 
we have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees  directors and non employee consultants 
prior to january   we accounted for share based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly no compensation expense was recorded because the exercise prices of the stock options equaled the market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grants 
however  prior to adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based compensation had been included in pro forma disclosures in the financial statement footnotes for periods prior to effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which establishes accounting for share based awards exchanged for employee services  using the modified prospective application transition method 
subsequently  we recorded compensation expense in our statement of operations over the service period that the awards are expected to vest 
compensation cost recognized in  includes the applicable amounts of a compensation cost of all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and previously presented in the pro forma footnote disclosures  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the new provisions of sfas no 
r 

table of contents we estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
share based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures  which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods 
forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 
we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
estimated option life is determined using the simplified method in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
analysis of results of operations and other the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december   and compared to revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december of of change in thousands total total software licenses software services maintenance appraisal services hardware and other total revenues software licenses 
changes in software license revenues consist of the following components software license revenue related to financial products  which comprise over of our software license revenues in the years presented  increased significantly compared to the prior year primarily due to growth from geographic expansion and increased success in winning larger contracts 
third party software revenue also increased over the comparable prior year because we sold more financial software modules that utilize third party software 
also  in late we simplified the implementation process for one of our financial products  which has enabled us to deliver the product more rapidly 
our financial software products automate accounting systems for cities  counties  school districts  public utilities and not for profit organizations 
in software license revenue related to our products other than financial systems experienced strong increases in the aggregate compared to software license revenues from our odyssey courts and justice products experienced a substantial increase over the prior year as a result of the product maturing following successful early implementations and leveraging our existing customer base 
in addition  licenses of our tax and appraisal products and a document management product were much higher than the prior year due to several new java based product releases and increased appraisal revaluation activity 
our appraisal software license volume varies from period to period dependent upon the special needs and timing of our customers 
local government taxing entities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process 
while certain of these taxing jurisdictions contract with our appraisal services division to perform the reappraisals  it is not always necessary for the customer to purchase new software in order to process the appraisals 
in some cases  a customer may simply add additional appraisal software modules to enhance the functionality of its existing software 
software services 
changes in software services revenues consist of the following components software services revenue related to financial products  which comprise more than half of our software service revenue in the years presented  increased significantly in compared to the prior year reflecting increased contract volume and additions 
table of contents to training staff which enabled us to deliver our backlog at a faster rate 
typically  software contracts include services such as installing the software  converting the customers data to be compatible with the software and training customer personnel to use the software 
our application service provider asp hosting and disaster recovery services also contributed to the increase as a result of geographic expansion  primarily in the south in the aftermath of hurricane katrina 
software services revenue related to odyssey courts and justice products was up moderately in compared to reflecting increased contract volume 
since march   we have increased our presence with odyssey in texas  florida and michigan and added one contract in nevada 
odyssey software services revenue did not increase as strongly as odyssey software license revenue because the prior year included a million contract for follow on services to an existing customer that had previously implemented and accepted the software 
software services revenue related to our document management products experienced strong increases in due to several new java based product releases and other related products 
maintenance 
we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party software 
maintenance revenues increased due to growth in our installed customer base as evidenced by our software license revenue and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines 
appraisal services 
the appraisal services business is driven in part by revaluation cycles in various states 
appraisal services revenue increased over the prior year mainly due to activity related to ohio s revaluation cycle  which occurs every six years as well as the addition of new customers 
the ohio revaluation cycle was nearly complete by the end of the level of appraisal services revenues in will depend on our ability to replace appraisal services revenues associated with the ohio revaluation 
cost of revenues and gross margins the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december of of related related change in thousands revenues revenues software licenses acquired software software services and maintenance appraisal services hardware and other total cost of revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the periods presented for the following years ended december gross margin percentages change software licenses and acquired software software services and maintenance appraisal services hardware overall gross margin cost of software license revenues 
our software license gross margin percentage in increased due to substantially higher software license revenues and slightly lower amortization expense of software development costs as some products became fully amortized during the first quarter of approximately half of our cost of software license revenues is amortization expense for capitalized development costs on certain software products with the remainder consisting of costs related to third party software 

table of contents amortization costs are fixed in nature and do not change with revenue changes 
once a product is released  we begin to amortize over the estimated useful life of the product the costs associated with its development 
amortization expense is determined on a product by product basis at an annual rate not less than straight line basis over the product s estimated life  which is generally five years 
development costs consist mainly of personnel costs  such as salary and benefits paid to our developers and rent for related office space 
cost of software services and maintenance revenues 
the software services and maintenance gross margin percentage in was comparable to the the cost of software services and maintenance increased because we added to our implementation and support staff to increase our capacity to support new sales growth and deliver sales backlog 
cost of software services and maintenance primarily consists of expenses  such as personnel costs related to installation of our software licenses  conversion of customer data  training customer personnel and support activities and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery 
cost of appraisal services revenues 
the appraisal services gross margin percentage increased in compared to mainly due to significant organizational changes and headcount reductions we made in the second quarter of to our appraisal services business to bring costs in line with expected levels of revenue 
in addition  margins in were negatively affected by cost inefficiencies associated with one large contract 
the overall gross margin percentage rose mainly due to a revenue mix that included more software license revenues  as well as lower costs as a result of the restructuring of our appraisal services business in the second quarter of software license revenue inherently has higher gross margins than other revenues such as software services and hardware 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth a comparison of our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the following years ended december of of change in thousands revenues revenues selling  general and administrative expenses in sg a includes a non cash purchased in process research and development charge of  relating to one of our acquisitions in january and million of non cash share based compensation expense as a result of implementing sfas no 
r in january partially offsetting these charges were lower sg a expenses relating to our appraisal services and appraisal and tax software businesses due to the restructuring of those businesses in the second quarter of restructuring charge because of unsatisfactory financial performance early in  we made significant organizational changes in the second quarter of to those areas of our business that were not performing to our expectations 
our goal was to bring costs in line with expected levels of revenue while improving the efficiency of our organizational structure to ensure that clients continue to receive superior service 
we reorganized the appraisal services business to eliminate levels of management and reduce overhead expense 
we also took actions to reduce headcount and costs in our appraisal and tax software division  and we consolidated certain senior management positions at the corporate office 
these cost reductions were made in the second quarter of as a result  we eliminated approximately positions  including management  staff and project related personnel 
in connection with the reorganization  we incurred certain charges which were primarily comprised of employee severance costs and related fringe benefits  and totaled approximately million before income taxes 
the related payments were paid in 
table of contents amortization of customer and trade name intangibles acquisition intangibles are composed of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired and amortizable software  customer and trade name intangibles with the remainder allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization 
however  amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as other expense 
the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles are to years 
the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the following years ended december change in thousands amortization of customer and trade name intangibles estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles  excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues  for the next five years is as follows in thousands other interest income is the main component of other income  which also includes non usage and other fees associated with a credit agreement we terminated in january  gain on sale of certain assets  gains and losses on risk management liabilities and assets associated with a foreign exchange contract and miscellaneous other items 
interest income in was million compared to  in income tax provision the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december change in thousands income tax provision effective income tax rate the effective income tax rates were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of primarily due to state income taxes  the qualified manufacturing activities deduction and non deductible meals and entertainment costs 
in the rate is also impacted by non deductible share based compensation expense 
the effective rate for was lower than the prior year mainly due to changes in the texas franchise tax law and rates enacted in the second quarter of  favorable state income tax audit results and lower state income taxes as a result of a change in our corporate structure implemented in early slightly more than half of our stock option awards granted qualify as incentive stock options iso for income tax purposes 
as such  a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an iso does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition 
stock option grants of non qualified options result in the creation of a deferred tax asset  which is a temporary difference  until the time that the option is exercised 
due to the treatment of incentive stock options for tax purposes  our effective tax rate from year to year is subject to variability 

table of contents compared to revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december of of change in thousands total total software licenses software services maintenance appraisal services hardware and other total revenues software licenses 
changes in software license revenues consist of the following components software license revenue related to financial products  which comprise approximately of our software license revenues in the years presented  increased slightly compared to the prior year primarily due to third party software products which enhance the functionality of our proprietary software 
software license revenue related to our odyssey courts and justice products declined in compared to the prior year was unusually high because it included approximately  of license fees earned upon final acceptance for two original odyssey installation sites 
in we had fifteen odyssey contracts in process compared to seven odyssey contracts in the implementation cycle for odyssey products ranges from nine to thirty six months depending on the scope of the contract and modification complexity 
we have recognized revenue on these contracts using contract accounting 
software services 
changes in software services revenues consist of the following components software services revenue related to financial products  which comprise more than half of our software service revenue in the years presented  increased moderately in compared to the prior year 
approximately one half of our financial software services revenue increase related to training and the remaining increases were due to new customers for our application service provider hosting and disaster recovery services and other miscellaneous services 
we increased our training staff in which enabled us to deliver our backlog at a faster rate 
software services revenue related to our odyssey courts and justice products increased significantly in compared to the prior year mainly due to a new million contract for follow on services to an existing customer that had previously implemented and accepted the software 
software services revenue related to appraisal and tax products declined substantially in this decline was mainly associated with the completion of several legacy appraisal and tax contracts in and early maintenance 
we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party software 
maintenance revenues increased due to growth in our installed customer base as evidenced by our software license revenue and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines 
appraisal services 
the decrease in appraisal services revenues is due to the completion in of certain significant appraisal contracts 
these larger projects are often relatively discretionary in nature compared to smaller projects which tend to occur on a more consistent basis  and the larger projects we recently completed have not been replaced by similar projects 
the appraisal services business is driven in part by revaluation cycles in various states 

table of contents cost of revenues and gross margins the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues  and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december of of related related change in thousands revenues revenues software licenses acquired software software services and maintenance appraisal services hardware and other total cost of revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the periods presented for the following years ended december gross margin percentages change software licenses and acquired software software services and maintenance appraisal services hardware overall gross margin cost of software license revenues 
amortization expense for capitalized software products declined from million in to million in  because certain software products became fully amortized during  which offset new amortization expense from software products released in cost of acquired software 
in cost of acquired software declined compared to the prior year because certain acquired software assets recorded for previous acquisitions became fully amortized 
cost of software services and maintenance revenues 
in cost of software services and maintenance grew while the related software services and maintenance revenues increased compared to the prior year period 
during  costs increased at a faster rate than related software services and maintenance revenues  which reflects lower utilization of personnel in our appraisal and tax software division  costs to support our recently released orion products  a shift in the roles of certain of our development personnel whose costs were capitalized in to projects that were expensed in  and higher health care costs 
cost of appraisal services revenues 
the decline in the cost of appraisal services revenues is the result of lower appraisal services revenues 
we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects completion 
in addition  in the second quarter of we made significant organizational changes to our appraisal services division because of the declining gross margins 
gross margin percentage 
the overall gross margin percentage decline was due to cost inefficiencies associated with lower appraisal services revenues and efforts and costs to support our recently released orion products  as well as a shift in the roles of certain of our development personnel whose costs were capitalized in to projects that are being expensed in and higher health care costs 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth a comparison of our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the following years ended december of of change in thousands revenues revenues selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased mainly due to higher health care costs and an increase in the number of marketing personnel 
these increases were offset somewhat by lower consulting fees associated with documenting our internal control processes 
other interest income is the main component of other income  which also includes non usage and other fees associated with a credit agreement we terminated in january  gain on sale of certain assets  gain on risk management assets associated with a foreign exchange contract and miscellaneous other items 
other income increased compared to mainly due to higher interest rates and a small gain on sale of certain assets 
income tax provision the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december change in thousands income tax provision effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate declined from due to the qualified manufacturing activities deduction enacted in and a corporate reorganization in which favorably impacted our state income tax provision 
financial condition and liquidity historically  we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities 
as of december   our combined cash and cash equivalents and short term investments including restricted cash equivalents and a restricted certificate of deposit balance was million compared to million at december  cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in cash and short term investments increased primarily due to continued strong operating performance and higher deferred revenue due to additional maintenance customers and new contract signings 
at december   our days sales outstanding dsos were days compared to dsos of days at december  dsos are calculated based on accounts receivable excluding long term receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by days 
investing activities used cash of million in  while investing activities provided cash of million in and used cash of million in in january  we acquired two companies  mazikusa  inc and tacs  inc 
the combined purchase price  including transaction costs  for the two companies was approximately million  comprised of approximately million in cash and  shares of tyler common stock 
in september we also purchased certain maintenance and support agreements associated with one of our financial products for approximately  other investing activities during were capital expenditures of million  including million for computer hardware and purchased software for internal use  including a new enterprise wide customer relationship management system  and other asset additions to support internal growth 
in and investing activities primarily consisted of investments in software development and property and equipment 
investing activities in also included adjustments to the acquisition of eden systems  inc eden 
pursuant to our purchase 
table of contents agreement  two of the shareholders of eden were granted the right to put their remaining shares to tyler and we were also granted the right to call the remaining shares 
in  we purchased the remaining  shares for  in cash 
we purchased million of short term investments during proceeds from sales of short term investments were million during during  the short term investments earned interest income of  which was reinvested 
we also earned interest income of  from money market investments and a restricted certificate of deposit 
financing activities used cash of million in compared to million in and million in cash used in financing activities was primarily comprised of purchases of treasury shares  net of proceeds from stock option exercises and contributions from our employee stock purchase plan 
during  we purchased approximately million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of million 
in  we received million from the exercise of options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock under our employee stock option plan 
during we issued  shares of common stock and received million in aggregate proceeds  upon exercise of stock options and during we issued  shares of common stock and received million in aggregate proceeds upon exercise of stock options 
in both and  we received million for contributions to the tyler technologies  inc employee stock purchase plan espp 
the espp was adopted by our shareholders in may subsequent to december  and through february  we purchased approximately  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of million 
we maintain a million letter of credit facility under which the bank will issue cash collateralized letters of credit 
as of december  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million to secure surety bonds required by some of our customer contracts 
in the first quarter of we acquired two small companies and a building for a combined cash purchase price of million 
we have not finalized the allocation of the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired companies but expect this allocation will result in non cash charges that may have a small dilutive effect on earnings per share in excluding acquisitions  we anticipate that capital spending will be between million and million  the majority of which will be related to computer equipment and software for infrastructure expansions 
we currently do not expect to capitalize significant amounts related to software development in but the actual amount and timing of those costs  and whether they are capitalized or expensed may result in additional capitalized software development 
capital spending in is expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 
from time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates 
in order to pursue such opportunities  which could require significant commitments of capital  we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future 
no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed 
in the absence of future acquisitions of other businesses  we believe our current cash balances and expected future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and other activities through the next twelve months 
if operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our needs  we believe that credit would be available to us 

table of contents we lease office facilities  as well as transportation  computer and other equipment used in our operations under non cancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options 
following are the future obligations under non cancelable leases at december  in thousands thereafter total future rental payments under operating leases it is not our usual business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements or to issue guarantees to third parties 
as of december  we have no material purchase commitments  except for the operating lease commitments listed above 
capitalization at december   our capitalization consisted of million of shareholders equity 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions  as defined 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the interpretation will have a material impact on our results from operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with earlier application encouraged 
any amounts recognized upon adoption as a cumulative effect adjustment will be recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
we have not yet determined the impact of sfas no 
on our financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and interest rates 
as of december   we had funds invested in auction rate municipal securities and state and municipal bonds  which we accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these investments were treated as available for sale under sfas no 
the carrying value of these investments approximates fair market value 
due to the nature of this investment  we are not subject to significant market rate risk 
we have no outstanding debt at december   and we therefore are not subject to any interest rate risk
