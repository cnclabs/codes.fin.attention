item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share data and unless otherwise indicated executive overview we are the largest equipment rental company in the world with an integrated network of rental locations in the united states  canada and mexico 
although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company  we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors 
these advantages include greater purchasing power  the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services as well as with newer and better maintained equipment  and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among branches 
we offer for rent over  classes of rental equipment  including construction equipment  industrial and heavy machinery  aerial work platforms  trench safety equipment and homeowner items 
our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals  sales of rental used equipment  sales of new equipment  contractor supplies sales and service and other 
rental equipment revenues have historically accounted for approximately percent of our total revenues and we expect this trend to continue 
in december  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our traffic control business to hts acquisition  inc hts  an entity newly formed by affiliates of private equity investors wynnchurch capital partners and oak hill special opportunities fund  lp in connection with this transaction  we recorded an after tax loss on sale in of traffic control was previously presented as a separate reporting segment 
this transaction closed in february and we received net proceeds of the loss on sale  as well as and prior period results for traffic control  have been reflected in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents in august  we received notice from the sec that it was conducting a non public  fact finding inquiry of the company 
the sec inquiry appears to relate to a broad range of the company s accounting practices and is not confined to a specific period 
in march  our board of directors formed a special committee to review matters related to the sec inquiry 
the special committee retained independent counsel 
the board of directors received and acted upon findings of the special committee in january the actions that we took with respect to the special committee s findings  including the restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements for and  are discussed in our form k 
the sec inquiry is ongoing and we are continuing to cooperate fully with the sec 
the us attorney s office has also requested information from the company informally and by subpoena about matters related to the sec inquiry 
the company is also cooperating fully with this office 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  in addition to the matters referenced above  we are also subject to certain ongoing class action and derivative suits 
although we have not accrued any amounts related to the ultimate disposition of these matters to date  any liabilities resulting from an adverse judgment or settlement of these matters may be material to our results of operations and cash flows during the period incurred 
other costs associated with the sec inquiry  the us attorney s office inquiry and the class action and derivative suits  including reimbursement of attorneys fees incurred by indemnified officers and directors  are expensed as incurred 
financial overview free cash flow gaap reconciliation we define free cash flow as i net cash provided by operating activities less ii purchases of rental and non rental equipment plus iii proceeds from sales of rental and non rental equipment  proceeds from sales of rental locations and proceeds from sales leaseback transactions 
management believes free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements 
however  free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
accordingly  free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity 
the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow 
full year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities purchases of rental equipment purchases of non rental equipment proceeds from sales of rental equipment proceeds from sales of non rental equipment proceeds from sales of rental locations proceeds from sales leaseback transactions free cash flow in  we reported revenues and free cash flow of billion and  respectively 
our revenue growth of percent trailed our primary end market  private non residential construction  which grew percent in according to department of commerce data 
department of commerce data has not been adjusted for inflation 
our percent revenue growth reflects increased rental rates of percent and a percentage point increase in dollar equipment utilization to percent 
dollar equipment utilization is calculated by dividing equipment rental revenue by the average original cost of equipment in our rental fleet 
in addition to generating significant revenue and free cash flow growth in  we also focused on reducing our total debt 
in  we reduced our total debt including our subordinated convertible debentures by 
table of contents in  we reported revenues and free cash flow of billion and  respectively 
our revenue growth of percent outpaced our primary end market  which grew percent in according to department of commerce data 
this growth reflects increased rental rates of percent and a percentage point increase in dollar equipment utilization to percent 
we are committed to capitalizing on future growth opportunities 
our goal is to grow revenues to approximately billion in we expect organic growth  prudent acquisitions and the expansion of complementary revenue streams such as contractor supplies to contribute to this growth 
revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december  were as follows year ended december  percent change equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other total revenues equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment  as well as related revenues such as the fees we charge for equipment delivery  fuel  repair or maintenance of rental equipment and damage waivers 
sales of rental equipment include our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment 
contractor supplies sales include our sales of supplies utilized by contractors  which include construction consumables  tools  small equipment and safety supplies 
services and other includes our repair services including parts sales as well as the operations of our subsidiaries that develop and market software for use by equipment rental companies in managing and operating multiple branch locations 
total revenues of billion increased percent compared with total revenues of billion in the increase primarily reflects an percent increase in equipment rentals and a percent increase in contractor supplies sales 
the increase in equipment rentals reflects a percent increase in rental rates and a percentage point increase in dollar equipment utilization 
the increase in contractor supplies sales reflects increased volume as we expanded our product offering 
equipment rentals represented percent and percent of our revenues in and  respectively 
total revenues of billion increased percent compared with total revenues of billion in the increase primarily reflects a percent increase in equipment rentals and a percent increase in contractor supplies sales 
the increase in equipment rentals reflects a percent increase in rental rates and a percentage point increase in dollar equipment utilization 
the increase in contractor supplies sales reflects increased volume as we expanded our product offering 
equipment rentals represented percent of our revenues in critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u 
s gaap 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in applying many accounting principles  we make assumptions  estimates and or judgments 
these assumptions  estimates and judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis 
material changes in these assumptions  estimates and judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations 
we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results were we to change underlying assumptions  estimates and judgments 
although actual results may differ from those estimates  we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize equipment rental revenue on a straight line basis 
our rental contract periods are daily  weekly or monthly 
by way of example  if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily  weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars  and  respectively  we would recognize revenue of per day 
the daily rate is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of by days  the monthly term 
as part of this straight line methodology  when the equipment is returned  we recognize as incremental revenue the excess  if any  between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date 
revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to  or pick up by  the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to  or pick up by  the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts 
these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect 
we base our estimate on a combination of an analysis of our accounts receivable on a specific accounts basis and historical write off experience 
our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances  including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers 
accordingly  we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance 
useful lives of rental equipment and property and equipment 
we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives  after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to ten percent of cost 
the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period the asset will generate revenues  and the salvage value is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period 
we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances 
if these estimates change in the future  we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 
purchase price allocation 
we have made a significant number of acquisitions in the past and expect that we will continue to make acquisitions in the future 
we allocate the cost of the acquired enterprise to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
with the exception of goodwill  long lived fixed assets generally represent the largest component of our acquisitions 
the long lived fixed assets that we acquire are primarily rental equipment  transportation equipment and real estate 
with limited exceptions  virtually all of the rental equipment that we have acquired through purchase business combinations has been classified as to be used  rather than as to be sold 
equipment that we acquire and classify as to be used is recorded at fair value  as determined by replacement cost to the company of such equipment 
we use third party valuation experts to help calculate replacement cost 
in addition to long lived fixed assets  we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities 
these other assets and liabilities typically include  but are not limited to  parts inventory  accounts receivable  accounts payable and other working capital items 
because of their short term nature  the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values reflected on the acquired entities balance sheets 
however  when appropriate  we adjust these book values for factors such as collectibility and existence 
the intangible assets that we have acquired are primarily goodwill  customer related intangibles specifically customer relationships and covenants not to compete 
goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
customer relationships and non compete agreements are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach with consideration to projected cash flows 
impairment of goodwill 
we have made acquisitions in the past that included the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill 
commencing january   goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently as events occur that indicate a decline in fair value below its carrying value 
in general  this means that we must determine whether the fair value of the goodwill  calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards  is at least equal to the recorded value on our balance sheet 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the recorded value  we are required to write off the excess goodwill as an operating expense 

table of contents prior to january   we tested for goodwill impairment on a branch by branch basis 
accordingly  a goodwill write off was required even if only one or a limited number of our branches had an impairment as of the testing date and even if there was no impairment for all our branches on an aggregate basis 
commencing january   we began testing for goodwill impairment at a regional  rather than a branch  level 
we began testing for impairment at this level because accounting standards require that goodwill impairment testing be performed at the reporting unit level 
in  following a reorganization of our reporting structure  our regions became our reporting units 
this change in reporting units may impact future goodwill impairment analyses because there are substantially fewer regions than there are branches 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review the valuation of our long lived assets on an ongoing basis and assess the carrying value of such assets if facts and circumstances suggest they may be impaired 
if this review indicates the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable  the carrying value is reduced to its estimated fair value 
the determination of recoverability is based upon an undiscounted cash flow analysis over the asset s remaining useful life 
we make estimates and assumptions when applying the undiscounted cash flow analysis 
these estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as changes in economic conditions  changes in our business prospects or other changing circumstances 
if these estimates change in the future  we may be required to recognize write downs on our long lived assets 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the enacted tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized 
in the case of deferred tax assets  the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
we generally evaluate projected taxable income for a five year period to determine the recoverability of all deferred tax assets and  in addition  examine the length of the carryforward to ensure the deferred tax assets are established at an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have not provided a valuation allowance related to the federal deferred tax asset associated with our federal net operating loss carryforwards because we believe that it is more likely than not that the full benefit of these amounts will be recovered during the carryforward period 
we have provided a partial valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset for certain foreign tax credit and state operating loss carryforward amounts 
these valuation allowances were required because it is more likely than not that some of the foreign tax credit and carryforward amounts will expire unused 
we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions 
accordingly  accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters 
our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 
reserves for claims 
we are exposed to various claims relating to our business  including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and self insured retentions  which we sometimes refer to as self insurance 
these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment or personnel 
these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and  accordingly  the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time 
our methodology for developing self insurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate actuarial valuations that are periodically prepared by our third party actuaries 
our estimation process considers  among other matters  the cost of known claims over time  cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims 
these estimates may change based on  among other things  changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims 
further  these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts 
accordingly  we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 

table of contents legal contingencies 
we are involved in a variety of claims  lawsuits  investigations and proceedings  as described elsewhere in this report 
we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information 
we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters  which involves an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual  or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount  they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination  judgment or settlement occurs 
results of operations as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  our reportable segments are general rentals and trench safety  pump and power 
the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction  aerial  industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities 
the general rentals segment s customers include construction and industrial companies  manufacturers  utilities  municipalities and homeowners 
the general rentals segment operates throughout the united states and canada and has one location in mexico 
the trench safety  pump and power segment includes the rental of specialty construction products and related services 
the trench safety  pump and power segment s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects  municipalities and industrial companies 
this segment operates in the united states and has one location in canada 
these segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates and allocates resources 
we evaluate segment performance based on segment operating results 
we completed acquisitions in each of   and which are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in view of the fact that our operating results for these years were affected by acquisitions  we believe that our results for these periods are not fully directly comparable  although there is no material impact from these acquisitions 
revenues by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december  were as follows general rentals trench safety  pump and power total equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other total revenue equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other total revenue equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other total revenue

fourth quarter items 
as previously discussed  in december  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our traffic control business to hts  which was completed in february in connection with this transaction  we recorded an after tax loss on sale in of the loss on sale  as well as and prior period results for traffic control  have been reflected in discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of reflecting recent loss experience related to our estimated provision for self insurance reserves 
of this amount  was recorded in cost of equipment rentals  excluding depreciation  and the balance was recorded in discontinued operations as it relates to our traffic control operations 
also  during the fourth quarter of  we reduced our reserve for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage by following our annual physical inventory inspections 
of this amount  was recorded in cost of contractor supplies sales and was recorded in cost of equipment rentals  excluding depreciation 
in addition to these matters  we recorded a charge of in the fourth quarter related to our estimated exposure for sales tax matters 
this amount has been reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations

prior period segment results have been recast to reflect this presentation 
additionally  in  we determined the amount of self insurance costs attributable to our traffic control operations exceeded the amount of such costs allocated to these operations and  as a result  have reflected more of these costs within discontinued operations than were previously allocated to traffic control when it was a reportable segment 
prior period segment results have been recast to reflect this presentation

gross margin 
we have historically realized higher gross margins on sales of rental equipment than on sales of new equipment 
this is consistent with the marketplace in general and not unique to united rentals 
gross margins by revenue classification were as follows year ended december  total gross margin equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other 
table of contents gross margin of percent increased percentage points from  reflecting a percentage point increase in equipment rentals gross margin and a percentage point increase in the sales of rental equipment gross margin  partially offset by a percentage point reduction in gross margin on contractor supplies 
the improved equipment rental margin reflected a percent increase in rental rates as well as a percentage point improvement in dollar equipment utilization 
the improved margin on sales of rental equipment reflects improved pricing and a shift in the mix of equipment sold 
the reduction in contractor supplies sales gross margin reflects increased costs related to our distribution centers 
gross margin of percent increased percentage point from the improved margin performance was primarily a result of a percentage point increase in equipment rentals gross margin  partially offset by a percentage point reduction in gross margins on contractor supplies sales

recent accounting pronouncements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the respective dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity 
we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices  which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services  ii the legal requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes  regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate 
our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility 
as of december   we had i of borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility portion of our senior secured credit facility  ii of borrowing capacity available under our accounts receivable securitization facility and iii cash and cash equivalents of we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next twelve months 
we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our existing operations over the next twelve months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital  ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale  iii payments due under operating leases  iv debt service and v acquisitions 
we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash 
in addition  we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our equipment or real estate or through the use of additional operating leases 
for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases  see certain information concerning contractual obligations 
the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors  including general economic conditions and growth prospects 
we estimate that our capital expenditures for will range between and we expect that we will fund such expenditures from proceeds from the sale of rental and non rental equipment  cash generated from operations and  if required  borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility 
while emphasizing internal growth  we intend to continue to expand through a disciplined acquisition program 
we will consider potential transactions of varying sizes and may  on a selective basis  pursue acquisition or consolidation opportunities involving other public companies or large privately held companies 
we expect to pay for future acquisitions using cash  capital stock  notes and or assumption of indebtedness 
to the extent that our existing sources of cash described above are not sufficient to fund such future acquisitions  we will require additional debt or equity financing and  consequently  our indebtedness may increase or the ownership of existing stockholders may be diluted as we implement our growth strategy 
term loan prepayment in the third quarter of  we prepaid of our outstanding term loan using of available cash and borrowed under our accounts receivable securitization facility 
contemporaneous with this term loan prepayment  we terminated a portion of our interest rate caps that were hedging our interest rate exposures on our term loan 
in the fourth quarter of  we subsequently repaid of the previously borrowed under our accounts receivable securitization facility 
retirement of subordinated convertible debentures as previously discussed  the subordinated convertible debentures included in our consolidated balance sheets reflect the obligation to our subsidiary trust that has 
table of contents issued percent convertible quarterly income preferred securities quips 
in  we announced the redemption of of quips 
the redemption price was percent 
in conjunction with the redemption  we retired of our subordinated convertible debentures 
this redemption was funded with proceeds from stock option exercises received during accounts receivable securitization in october  we amended our existing accounts receivable securitization facility 
the amended facility provides for generally lower borrowing costs and the facility size has been increased from to additionally  the maturity date has been extended from may to october borrowings under the amended facility will continue to be reflected as debt on our consolidated balance sheets 
loan covenants and compliance 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of our senior secured credit facility  the senior notes  the quips and our accounts receivables securitization facility 
any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 
we consider our most restrictive covenant to be the minimum interest coverage ratio  which is the ratio of our consolidated net income to our interest expense  as defined in our senior secured credit facility 
the minimum amount permitted under this covenant is to and our actual minimum interest coverage ratio for the year ended december  was to sources and uses of cash 
during  we i generated cash from operations of  ii generated cash from the sale of rental and non rental equipment of and iii received proceeds from the exercise of stock option of we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and non rental equipment of  ii fund payments on debt  net of proceeds received  of and iv retire of subordinated convertible debentures 
during  we i generated cash from operations of and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and non rental equipment of we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and non rental equipment of  ii fund debt repayments and financing costs of and iii purchase other companies  net of cash acquired  of during  we i generated cash from operations of and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and non rental equipment of we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and non rental equipment of  ii purchase other companies  net of cash acquired  of and iii fund payments on debt  net of proceeds received  as well as financing costs of the consolidated statements of cash flows include the traffic control business for all periods presented and we have not reclassified these cash flows 
our principal sources and uses of cash for traffic control have related to working capital items and capital expenditures for rental and non rental equipment 
additionally  in  we agreed to maintain in an investment account for a traffic control subsidiary to conduct traffic control business with the state of florida 
in march  we signed an agreement with the state of florida whereby we were no longer required to maintain these funds in any type of account 
other than this commitment  traffic control has not significantly impacted our liquidity and capital resources 
traffic control s capital expenditures have historically been insignificant to our consolidated results and we do not expect the sale of traffic control to have a material effect on our future cash flows  financial position and results of operations 
we intend to reinvest proceeds received from the sale in our operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt and ii foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily associated with our canadian operations 
interest rate risk 
we periodically utilize interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements to manage our interest costs and exposure to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of billion and cap agreements with an agreement notional amount of the effect of the swap agreements were  at december   to convert billion of our fixed rate notes to floating rate instruments 
the fixed rate notes being converted consisted of i of our percent notes through  ii of our percent notes through  and iii of our percent senior subordinated notes through certain of these swaps contain mutual put provisions which allow either party to terminate the swap for the market value of the swap as of certain specified dates between and in february  swaps with a notional of were modified and  as a result  these swaps will be de designated as fair value hedges 
accordingly  there may be volatility in our future earnings 
as of december   after giving effect to our interest rate swap and cap agreements  we had an aggregate of billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates 
for this purpose  the portion of the term loan subject to the cap is considered fixed 
the debt that is subject to fluctuations in interest rates includes of borrowings under our revolving canadian facility  of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility  billion in swaps and of term loans not subject to an interest rate cap 
the weighted average interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt on december  were i percent for the revolving credit facility which represents the canadian rate  since the amount outstanding was canadian borrowings  ii percent for borrowings outstanding related to the accounts receivable securitization facility  iii percent for the debt subject to our swap agreements and iv percent for the term loan 
as of december   based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding  after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements  our annual earnings would decrease by approximately for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 
the amount of our variable rate indebtedness may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the amount of indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility from time to time 
additionally  the amount of our variable rate indebtedness may fluctuate based on changes in our interest rate swaps and caps portfolio 
all such derivatives are entered into for hedging  as opposed to speculative  purposes 
all of our interest rate cap agreements terminate in june for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
currency exchange risk 
the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar 
as a result  our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars 
based upon the level of our canadian operations during relative to the company as a whole  a percent change in this exchange rate would not have a material impact on our earnings
