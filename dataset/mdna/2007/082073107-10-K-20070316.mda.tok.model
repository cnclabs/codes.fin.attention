item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section is intended to help potential investors understand the financial performance of benjamin franklin bancorp and benjamin franklin bank through a discussion of the factors affecting our financial condition at december   and and our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial 
table of contents statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear in item of this annual report 
in this section  we sometimes refer to benjamin franklin bank and benjamin franklin bancorp together as benjamin franklin since the financial condition and results of operation of benjamin franklin bancorp closely reflect the financial condition and results of operation of its sole operating subsidiary  benjamin franklin bank 
the discussion beginning in the overview section below reviews the company s performance for the and years 
looking ahead to  there are several factors that may serve to reduce the company s earnings below current levels in september   the company opened a new branch in wellesley hills  massachusetts 
the company is committed to opening additional new branches  most likely in the markets contiguous to its existing branch communities 
one such location has been identified  in watertown  massachusetts  where the company expects to open a branch in mid management estimates the annual direct costs of operating this branch at  this branch opening  the recent opening in wellesley  and any others that occur  are likely to act as a drag on earnings until such time as they attain profitability 
the company experienced net interest margin nim compression throughout and in the fourth quarter in particular  due to the effect of increased price competition for certificate accounts and the inversion of the treasury yield curve  which had the effect of reducing the spread between the company s earning assets and its deposit accounts 
until  and if  the treasury yield curve regains a positive slope  management expects that the company s nim will remain compressed compared to the nim earned in earlier periods 
the board of directors adopted the benjamin franklin bancorp  inc stock incentive plan the plan  approved by stockholders at the may  annual meeting 
awards made under the plan on july  will have the effect of increasing compensation expense in future periods 
in particular  for stock options awarded under the plan  the company is employing an accelerated method of expense recognition  whereby compensation cost is measured on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award  as if the award was in substance  multiple awards 
refer to page f for an estimate of the amount and timing of compensation cost to be recognized for awards made to date under the plan 
overview income 
benjamin franklin bancorp s results of operations are dependent mainly on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and investment portfolios and interest expense incurred on its deposits and borrowed funds 
results of operations are also affected by fee income from banking and non banking operations  provisions for loan losses  gains losses on sales of loans and securities available for sale  loan servicing income and other miscellaneous income 
expenses 
benjamin franklin s expenses consist primarily of compensation and employee benefits  office occupancy  technology  marketing  general administrative expenses and income tax expense 
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly with respect to changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may materially impact benjamin franklin s financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assessments by management  and which could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
benjamin franklin considers the following to be critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses 
this accounting policy is considered critical due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the underlying assumptions used  and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in material changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses considered necessary 
the allowance is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based on a periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and size of the loan 
table of contents portfolio  adverse situations that may affect borrowers ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
for a full discussion of the allowance for loan losses  please refer to business asset quality in item income taxes 
management considers accounting for income taxes as a critical accounting policy due to the subjective nature of certain estimates that are involved in the calculation 
benjamin franklin uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is established when  in management s judgment  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
adjustments to increase or decrease the valuation allowance are generally charged or credited  respectively  to income tax expense 
intangible assets 
benjamin franklin considers accounting for goodwill to be critical because significant judgment is exercised in performing periodic valuations of this asset  which arose through the acquisitions of chart bank and foxboro national bank 
goodwill is evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis as of each december st  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a potential for impairment 
at the time of each acquisition  the operations of chart bank and foxboro national bank were combined with the operations of benjamin franklin based on similar economic characteristics 
accordingly  discrete financial information is not separately maintained to evaluate the operating results of the former chart bank and foxboro national bank and  as a result  in performing a goodwill impairment evaluation  benjamin franklin measures the fair value of the entire company  rather than that of each of the acquired banks 
if impairment is detected  the carrying value of goodwill is reduced through a charge to earnings 
the evaluation of goodwill involves estimations of discount rates and the timing of projected future cash flows  which are subject to change with changes in economic conditions and other factors 
such changes in the assumptions used to evaluate this intangible asset affect its value and could have a material adverse impact on benjamin franklin s results of operations 
this discussion has highlighted those accounting policies that management considers to be critical  however all accounting policies are important  and therefore the reader is encouraged to review each of the policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements to gain a better understanding of how benjamin franklin s financial performance is measured and reported

net interest income increased million to million for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december  the increase was the result of a million  or  increase in average interest earning assets  offset by a basis point decline or in the net interest margin 
the increase in interest earning assets was due primarily to million of growth  on average  in the loan portfolio  supplemented by a net combined increase of million in average securities and short term investments 
these year over year increases are partially attributable to the full year effect in of the chart bank merger  whereby million of interest earning assets  including million in net loans  were acquired on april  the yield on average interest earning assets increased by basis points year over year  due mainly to an increase in market interest rates

deposits 
deposits increased by million to million at december   an increase of over a total of million at december  the million increase in the bank s deposits was attributable to an increase of million in deposits as a result of the chart bank acquisition  offset by a million decline from december  to december  while all deposit categories increased year over year  the largest increases were in certificates of deposit million  money market accounts million and demand accounts million 

table of contents the company experienced a shift in deposit mix during the year  as deposit customers displayed a marked preference toward certificates of deposits as compared to other interest bearing deposit products  such as savings  now  or money market accounts 
excluding million absorbed in the chart bank acquisition  certificate balances increased by million over the twelve month period ending december  conversely  savings and money market categories had net outflows of and million  respectively  exclusive of the acquired balances

of the borrowed funds acquired from chart  million matured during the second and third quarters of those borrowings and the remainder of the net increase  or million  were placed in new fhlbb borrowings with original maturities of three to five years 
the million balance in subordinated debt was unchanged during stockholders equity 
total stockholders equity was million as of december   an increase of million compared to million at december  the increase was primarily attributable to the company s mutual to stock conversion and issuance of shares in connection with the acquisition of chart bank 
the components of the net increase were a the recording of common stock and additional paid in capital in the initial public offering in the amount of million  net of offering expenses of million  b shares issued to the benjamin franklin bank charitable foundation in the amount of million  c shares issued to chart bank shareholders in the amount of million  d net income of  net of e dividends paid to shareholders in the amount of  f a reduction of  in other comprehensive income resulting from a decrease in the fair market value of investments available for sale  and g a decrease of million  representing the valuation of common shares purchased and held by the employee stock ownership plan 
comparison of operating results for the year ended december  and december  net income 
net income for the year ended december  was  million lower than the million in net income for the year the reduction in net income was primarily a result of two non recurring charges incurred in the second quarter of a million after tax contribution made to the benjamin franklin bank charitable foundation  and the recognition of a net loss of million on the sale write down of bank owned land 
significant increases in net interest income and non interest income  due to the acquisition of the operations of chart bank and to internally generated balance sheet growth  partially offset the non recurring charges 
operating expenses also increased significantly year over year due to the addition of chart bank s operations  as well as to higher costs related to generating internal growth and meeting the demands of operating as a public company 
net interest income 
net interest income increased million to million for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december  the increase was the result of an increase in average interest earning assets of million  greater than the increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million  and to a basis point increase in the net interest margin 
the funds received in the company s public stock offering and an increase in non interest bearing deposit accounts were the primary reasons that average interest earning assets grew by more than average interest bearing liabilities  when compared to the year the increase in average interest earning assets was due primarily to the chart bank acquisition  as million of interest earning assets were acquired on april   including million in net loans 
internally generated growth in loans outstanding  exclusive of the addition of the chart bank loan portfolio  represented the remaining increase in average interest earning assets 
as a whole  average loan balances increased million year over year 
the yield on average interest earning assets increased by basis points year over year  due to an increase in market interest rates overall and the favorable mix of the assets acquired from chart bank 
funding liabilities also increased due to the chart bank acquisition on april   including million in deposits and million of borrowed funds 
including the acquisition  interest bearing 
table of contents deposits grew million on average  while the average balances of outstanding borrowings increased by million 
rates paid on interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points  as a basis point increase in deposit costs was partially offset by a reduction in the weighted average rate paid on borrowed funds 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or compared to million earned in the prior year 
most of the increase was the result of the million increase in average interest earning assets  augmented by a sizable basis point increase in the yield earned on average interest earning assets 
the increase in average interest earning assets was primarily the result of the acquisition of chart bank and the company s public stock offering 
the largest increase occurred in average loan balances million due to the acquisition of the million chart bank loan portfolio and internally generated growth 
by itself  the million increase in average loan balances year over year resulted in million in growth of interest income 
increases in average balances of securities and short term investments of million and million  respectively  were also related to both the acquisition of chart bank and the stock offering 
the increases in yields earned on securities and short term investments of basis points and basis points  respectively  were due mainly to the increase in market interest rates during the last two years 
the increase in the loan yield of basis points was due to the increase in market interest rates  the addition of the chart bank loan portfolio  which was more heavily weighted toward higher yielding commercial loans than that of benjamin franklin  and to internally generated growth in higher yielding commercial loans 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million as compared to interest expense of million for the year ended december  much of the increase was the result of the million increase in average interest bearing liabilities  in addition to a basis point increase in their rate paid 
the million increase was caused primarily by the chart bank acquisition  which added million to the company s funding liabilities including non interest bearing demand deposits on april  overall  average interest bearing deposits increased million year over year  while borrowed funds increased by million 
a basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits during the year was due in part to the increase in market interest rates  the composition of the chart bank deposit base  which had a greater proportion of higher cost certificate balances than did that of benjamin franklin  and a trend  particularly late in the year  toward cd demand as compared to other types of deposits 
with gradually rising market interest rates  the company and other financial institutions in its market area responded to customer demand by increasing their rates paid on cd accounts 
within the company s deposit portfolio  the average balance of cd s increased by million year over year  while the other interest bearing deposit categories combined increased million 
outside of cd s and money market accounts  the company was generally able to refrain from raising its deposit rates in the cost of borrowed funds dropped by basis points year over year  as borrowings acquired from chart bank were at lesser rates than that of benjamin franklin 
provision for loan losses 
the company records a provision for loan losses as a charge to its earnings when necessary in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
refer to business asset quality for additional information about the company s methodology for establishing its allowance for loan losses 
loan loss provisions were  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
provisions in both years were primarily reflective of growth in the loan portfolio  as net charge offs recoveries in both years were nominal 
at december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million  or of the loan portfolio  compared to million  or  of total loans at december  the increase in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of the loan portfolio was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of commercial loans in the portfolio 
non interest income 
non interest income for the year ended december  rose to million  an increase of million  or  when compared to million earned during the year ended december  this increase was produced primarily by growth in fee based deposit accounts and the 
table of contents acquisition of chart bank 
non interest income was also adversely impacted by a million net loss on the sale write down of bank owned land in june during the second quarter of  two parcels of land that had been held as future branch sites were sold for an aggregate gain of  a third parcel that had been held as a future branch site was written down by million to its estimated net fair market value  once the decision was made by the company to market the parcel for sale 
the company s determination to sell the property followed a decision by the town planning board to reject the company s proposed plans for combined retail banking development of the parcel  after the company had reworked the plans to deal with the concerns previously raised by the planning board 
although the company s executive committee considered whether to again revise and resubmit development plans that would be acceptable both to the company and the planning board  the committee decided that under the circumstances it would not continue to pursue its combined retail banking development plans 
this decision was consistent with the company s emerging strategy of opting in favor of leasing rather than owning future branch locations 
the company s current strategy contemplates the opening of new branches over the next few years  and in all likelihood future branch locations will be leased rather than owned 
exclusive of the land transactions  non interest income increased by million  or  during the year the chart bank acquisition provided a new non interest income source  fees earned on atm servicing performed by cssi  which yielded million in revenues 
cssi provides cash to atms owned by independent service organizations nationwide 
fees are collected from the independent service organizations for managing the atms and for the use of the cash in the machines 
other significant revenue increases year over year included deposit service fees  loan servicing fees  and miscellaneous income 
growth in fees earned on deposit accounts and miscellaneous income was mainly the result of the addition of the chart bank deposit accounts and branch locations  plus the addition of a new overdraft checking account offering to the bank s product line 
increases in loan servicing fees were a combination of higher fees collected on commercial loan transactions primarily prepayment penalties and late charges and a reduction in the amortization of mortgage servicing rights 
non interest expense 
non interest expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  when compared to million incurred during the year ended december  non interest expenses increased significantly year over year due primarily to the acquisition of chart bank  expansion of the company s lending capabilities and the stock conversion  which has brought new costs associated with operating a public company 
also contributing to the rise was a million contribution made to the benjamin franklin bank charitable foundation in april of the contribution to the foundation was one time in nature  as the company has no intention of making future contributions to the foundation 
excluding the contribution  the increase in non interest expenses would have been million  or 
the largest year over year increase in non interest expense was in salaries and employee benefits expenses  which increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of chart bank and to a lesser degree to the addition of loan origination and support staff in occupancy and equipment expenses increased  or  to million for the year ended december  this increase was mainly due to the addition of costs associated with chart bank s three branch locations and its former corporate headquarters 
the rental expense associated with the lease of the headquarters location ceased at the end of july increases in data processing costs  or and other general and administrative expenses million or were both due primarily to the effect of adding chart bank operations 
other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  included non cash charges of million for the amortization of core deposit intangible assets  million higher than the comparable period in the increase was entirely associated with the chart bank acquisition 
other large year over year increases in general and administrative expenses included marketing and advertising  insurance premiums  postage and supplies  and directors fees 
the increase in marketing costs was primarily due to branding efforts in the chart bank market area subsequent to the acquisition 
directors fees increased with the addition of six new board members from chart bank  as a result of increases to the board fee structure due to the increased responsibilities of being a director of a public company  and due to the implementation of a retirement plan for directors 
professional fees increased  or  to million for the year ended december  
table of contents this increase was due primarily to increased legal  consulting  audit and investor relations fees  such increases consistent with the company s new status as a public company 
income taxes 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of  or  from the  recorded for the year ended december  the effective tax rates for the and years were and  respectively 
the significant increase in the effective tax rate in the year was primarily a function of the bank owned land transactions 
no tax benefit was recognized on the million net loss on sale write down of bank owned land

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management and the board of benjamin franklin recognize that taking and managing risk is fundamental to the business of banking 
through the development  implementation and monitoring of its policies with respect to risk management  the bank strives to measure  evaluate and control the risks it faces 
the board and management understand that an effective risk management system is critical to the safety and soundness of the bank 
chief among the risks faced by benjamin franklin are credit risk  market risk including interest rate risk  liquidity risk  operational transaction risk and compliance risk 
within management  the responsibility for risk management rests with the risk management committee  chaired by the compliance and risk management officer 
other members of the committee include the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  controller  and the senior officers responsible for lending  retail banking and human resources 
the risk management committee meets on a monthly basis to review the status of the company s risk management efforts  including reviews of internal and external audit findings  loan review findings  and the activities of the asset liability committee with respect to monitoring interest rate and liquidity risk 
the committee tracks any open items requiring corrective action with the goal of ensuring that each is addressed on a timely basis 
the compliance and risk management officer reports all findings of the risk management committee directly to the board s audit and risk management committee 
management of credit risk 
benjamin franklin considers credit risk to be the most significant risk it faces  in that it has the greatest potential to affect the financial condition and operating results of the bank 
credit risk is managed through a combination of policies established by the board  the monitoring of compliance with these policies  and the periodic evaluation of loans in the portfolio  including those with problem characteristics 
in general  benjamin franklin s policies establish maximums on the amount of credit that may be granted to a single borrower including affiliates  the aggregate amount of loans outstanding by type in relation to total assets and capital  and loan concentrations 
collateral and debt service coverage ratios  approval limits and other underwriting criteria are also specified 
policies also exist with respect to performing periodic credit reviews  the rating of loans  when loans should be placed on non performing status and factors that should be considered in establishing the bank s allowance for loan losses 
for additional information  refer to business lending activities 
management of market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in market prices and rates  and typically encompasses exposures such as sensitivity to changes in market interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
benjamin franklin has no exposure to foreign currency exchange or commodity price movements 
because net interest income is benjamin franklin s primary source of revenue  interest rate risk is a significant market risk to which the bank is exposed 

table of contents interest rate risk is the exposure of benjamin franklin s net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates as well as by fluctuations in the level  mix and duration of benjamin franklin s assets and liabilities 
over and above the influence that interest rates have on net interest income  changes in rates may also affect the volume of lending activity  the ability of borrowers to repay variable rate loans  the volume of loan prepayments and refinancings  the flow and mix of deposits  and the market value of the bank s assets and liabilities 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by benjamin franklin through periodic evaluations of the current interest rate risk inherent in its rate sensitive assets and liabilities  coupled with determinations of the level of risk considered appropriate given the bank s capital and liquidity requirements  business strategy  and performance objectives 
through such management  benjamin franklin seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its net interest income to changes in interest rates 
strategies used by benjamin franklin to reduce the potential volatility of its earnings include emphasizing the origination and retention of adjustable rate mortgage loans  variable rate commercial loans and variable rate home equity lines of credit  investing in securities with relatively short maturities and or expected average lives  classifying nearly all of the investment portfolio as available for sale in order to provide for flexibility in liquidity management 
benjamin franklin s asset liability committee  comprised of several members of senior and middle management  is responsible for managing interest rate risk 
on a quarterly basis  the committee reviews with the board of directors its analysis of the bank s exposure to interest rate risk  the effect subsequent changes in interest rates could have on the bank s future net interest income  its strategies and other activities  and the effect of those strategies on benjamin franklin s operating results 
the committee is also actively involved in the bank s planning and budgeting process as well as in determining pricing strategies for deposits and loans 
the committee s primary method for measuring and evaluating interest rate risk is income simulation analysis 
this analysis considers the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities  as well as the relative sensitivities of these balance sheet components over a range of interest rate scenarios 
interest rate scenarios tested generally include instantaneous rate shocks compared against static or flat rates 
the simulation analysis is used to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a specified time horizon  usually a two year period 
the table below sets forth  as of december   the estimated changes in benjamin franklin s net interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in the us treasury yield curve 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
percentage change in estimated net interest income over months basis point increase in rates basis point increase in rates basis point increase in rates flat interest rates basis point decrease in rates basis point decrease in rates as indicated in the table above  the result of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates is estimated to increase net interest income by 
over a month horizon  when compared to the flat rate scenario 
for an immediate basis point parallel increase in the level of interest rates  net interest income is estimated to increase by over a month horizon  when compared against the flat rate scenario 
the estimated change in net interest income from the flat rate scenario for a basis point parallel decline in the level of interest rates is a decrease of 
inherent in these estimates is the assumption that savings and 
table of contents money market deposit account deposit rates would change by basis points and basis points  respectively  for each basis point change in market interest rates 
these scenarios also assume no change in now account interest rates 
interest rates for certain premium checking and money market accounts are expected to vary to the full extent of any increase or decrease in market interest rates 
these assumptions are based on the bank s past experience with the changes in rates paid on these non maturity deposits coincident with changes in market interest rates 
there are inherent shortcomings in income simulation  given the number and variety of assumptions that must be made in performing the analysis 
the assumptions relied upon in making these calculations of interest rate sensitivity include the level of market interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  the degree to which certain assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods to repricing react to changes in market interest rates  the degree to which non maturity deposits react to changes in market rates  the expected prepayment rates on loans and mortgage backed securities  the degree to which early withdrawals occur on certificates of deposit and the volume of other deposit flows 
as such  although the analysis shown above provides an indication of benjamin franklin s sensitivity to interest rate changes at a point in time  these estimates are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on benjamin franklin s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
liquidity risk management 
liquidity risk  or the risk to earnings and capital arising from an organization s inability to meet its obligations without incurring unacceptable losses  is managed by benjamin franklin s treasurer  who monitors on a daily basis the adequacy of benjamin franklin s liquidity position 
oversight is provided by the asset liability committee  which reviews benjamin franklin s liquidity on a weekly basis  and by the board of directors  which reviews the adequacy of benjamin franklin s liquidity resources on a monthly basis 
benjamin franklin s primary sources of funds are from deposits  amortization of loans  loan prepayments and the maturity of loans  mortgage backed securities and other investments  and other funds provided by operations 
while scheduled payments from amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities and maturing loans and investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments can be greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
benjamin franklin maintains excess funds in cash and short term interest bearing assets that provide additional liquidity 
at december   cash and due from banks excluding cash provided by cssi to atm customers  short term investments and debt securities maturing within one year totaled million or of total assets 
benjamin franklin also relies on outside borrowings from the federal home loan bank of boston  as an additional funding source 
in  benjamin franklin has expanded its use of federal home loan bank of boston borrowings to fund growth in the loan portfolio and to assist in the management of its interest rate risk 
since december   benjamin franklin has increased federal home loan bank of boston borrowings by million to a total of million outstanding as of december  on that date  benjamin franklin had the ability to borrow an additional million from the federal home loan bank of boston 
the formula for computing the company s borrowing availability at the federal home loan bank of boston at december  does not include million of residential mortgage loans held for sale at year end benjamin franklin uses its liquidity to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund maturing certificates of deposit and borrowings  to fund other deposit withdrawals  to invest in other interest earning assets and to meet operating expenses 
benjamin franklin anticipates that it will continue to have sufficient funds and alternative funding sources to meet its current and future commitments

management of other risks 
two additional risk areas that receive significant attention by management and the board are operational risk and compliance risk 
operational risk is the risk to earnings and capital 
table of contents arising from control deficiencies  problems with information systems  fraud  error or unforeseen catastrophes 
compliance risk is the risk arising from violations of  or nonconformance with  laws  rules  regulations  prescribed practices  internal policies and procedures or ethical standards 
compliance risk can expose the company to fines  civil money penalties  payment of damages and the voiding of contracts 
benjamin franklin addresses such risks through the establishment of comprehensive policies and procedures with respect to internal control  the management and operation of its information and communication systems  disaster recovery  and compliance with laws  regulations and banking best practice 
monitoring of the efficacy of such policies and procedures is performed through a combination of benjamin franklin s internal audit program  through periodic internal and third party compliance reviews  and through the ongoing attention of its managers charged with supervising compliance and operational control 
oversight of these activities is provided by the risk management committee and the audit and risk management committee of the board
