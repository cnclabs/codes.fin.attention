you should read the following discussion and analysis along with the selected financial data and the financial statements and notes attached to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview we were incorporated in june from our inception through december   our activities related primarily to establishing and operating a biotechnology research and development organization and developing relationships with our corporate collaborators 
our scientific and business development endeavors currently focus on the engineering of novel zinc finger dna binding proteins zfps for the regulation and modification of genes 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses in the future as we continue our research and development activities 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities  borrowings  payments from federal government research grants and from corporate collaborators and strategic partners 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our revenues have consisted primarily of revenues from our corporate partners for zfp tfs and zfns  contractual payments from strategic partners for research programs and research milestones  and federal government research grant funding 
we expect revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period and there can be no assurance that new collaborations or partner fundings will continue beyond their initial terms 
in  we have continued to place more emphasis on higher value therapeutic product development and related strategic partnerships and less emphasis on our enabling technology collaborations 
we believe this shift in emphasis has the potential to increase the return on investment to our stockholders by allocating capital resources to higher value  therapeutic product development activities 
at the same time  it may reduce our revenues over the next several years and subject to higher financial risk by increasing expenses associated with product development 
we filed an investigational new drug ind application with the us food and drug administration fda and initiated a phase clinical trial of a zfp therapeutic in patients with diabetic neuropathy during the fourth quarter of development of novel therapeutic products is costly and is subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process by the fda 
our future products are gene based therapeutics 
adverse events in both our own clinical program and other programs may have a negative impact on regulatory approval  the willingness of potential commercial partners to enter into agreements and the perception of the public 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  stock based compensation expense  pre clinical and clinical studies  laboratory supplies  allocated facilities costs  subcontracted research expenses  and expenses for trademark registration and technology licenses 
research and development costs incurred in connection with collaborator funded activities are expensed as incurred 
costs to acquire technologies that are utilized in research and development and that have no alternative future use are expensed as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
we expect these expenses will increase significantly as we focus increasingly on development of zfp therapeutics 
additionally  in order to develop zfp tfs and zfns as commercially relevant therapeutics  we expect to expend additional resources for expertise in the manufacturing  regulatory affairs and clinical research aspects of biotherapeutic development 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  patent prosecution expenses  allocated facilities costs and other general corporate expenses 
as we pursue commercial development of our therapeutic leads we expect the business aspects of the company to become more complex 
we may be required in the future to add personnel and incur additional costs related to the maturity of our business 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
sangamo believes the following critical accounting policies have significant effect in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  revenue from research activities made under strategic partnering agreements and enabling technology collaborations is recognized as the services are provided when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
amounts received in advance under such agreements are deferred until the above criteria are met and the research services are performed 
sangamo s federal government research grants are typically multi year agreements and provide for the reimbursement of qualified expenses for research and development as defined under the terms of the grant agreement 
revenue under grant agreements is recognized when the related qualified research expenses are incurred 
grant reimbursements are typically received on a quarterly basis and are subject to the issuing agency s right of audit 
milestone payments under research  partnering  or licensing agreements are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of mutually agreed upon milestones  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievement is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii there are no performance obligations associated with the milestone payment 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  revenue arrangements entered into after june   that include multiple deliverables  are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the fair value of the delivered items can be determined and whether there is evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  the consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criterion is considered separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
stock based compensation prior to january   the company accounted for our stock based employee compensation arrangements under the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 as allowed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 

as a result  no expense was recognized for options to purchase our common stock that were granted with an exercise price equal to fair market value at the date of grant and no expense was recognized in connection with purchases under our employee stock purchase plan for the years ended december  or in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june  subsequent to the effective date  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition 
effective january   the company has adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
under this method  compensation cost recognized includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
amortized on an accelerated basis over the options vesting period  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r amortized on a straight line basis over the options vesting period 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r on january   the net loss is greater by million for year ended december  than had the company continued to account for stock based employee compensation under apb no 
basic and diluted net loss per share for year ended december  is greater than if the company had continued to account for stock based compensation under apb no 
the adoption of sfas no 
r had no impact on cash flows from operations or financing 
on november   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
we have elected to adopt the 
table of contents alternative transition method provided in the fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects if any of stock based compensation expense pursuant to sfas r 
the alterative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact to the apic pool and the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
results of operations years ended december   and total revenues year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except percentage values revenues collaboration agreements federal government research grants total revenues we are increasing the emphasis of our research and development activities on zfp therapeutics 
even with this change in resource allocation  we anticipate increasing revenues over the next several years primarily related to our research license and commercial option agreement with dow agrosciences llc das  a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of dow chemical corporation 
total revenues consisted of revenues from collaboration agreements  strategic partnerships and federal government research grants 
revenues from our corporate collaboration and strategic partnering agreements were million in  compared to million in  and  in the increase in from was principally attributable to increased revenues of approximately million in connection with our research license and commercial option agreement with das and  in connection with our collaboration in the field of regenerative medicine with lifescan 
the increase in from was principally attributable to increased revenues of approximately  related to our research collaboration agreement with pfizer  increased revenues of approximately  in connection with our research license and commercial option agreement with das  and increased revenues of approximately  in connection with our collaboration in the field of regenerative medicine with lifescan 
these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues of  from our therapeutics partnership with edwards lifesciences corporation edwards  as well as lower revenues of approximately  associated with other enabling technology collaborations 
the decreased revenue from edwards is due to the submission of the first ind by edwards for a licensed product under the agreement with sangamo 
federal government research grant revenues were million in   in and  in the increase in from was primarily attributable to increased revenue of  in connection with our advanced technology program grant awarded by the national institute of standards and technology   in connection with our cystic fibrosis grant awarded by cystic fibrosis foundation and  in connection with our zfn driven gene disruption of ccr as a potential treatment of aids grant awarded by the national institutes of health 
these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues of  from our federal government grant associated with sickle cell 
the increase in from was primarily attributable to increased revenue of  in connection with our advanced technology program grant awarded by the national institute of standards and technology 
during the fourth quarter of  the company concluded that  since the inception  revenues related to this grant had been under recorded by  a one time adjustment for this amount was recorded during the fourth quarter of and is the primary reason for the increased federal government research grant revenues in as compared to we plan to continue to apply for federal government research grants

we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in the future and expect research and development expenses to increase in the next several years if we are successful in advancing our zfp therapeutic product candidates into clinical trials 
to the extent we collaborate with others with respect to clinical trials  increases in research and development expenses may be reduced or avoided 
research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in the increase of million in from was principally due to increased expenses associated with the acquisition of all assets in edwards zfp therapeutic angiogenesis program valued at million  million of stock based compensation due to adoption of sfas no 
r  increased expenses for laboratory supplies of approximately million  increased expenses associated with diabetic neuropathy related clinical studies of million  increased expenses for salaries and related benefits of  due to increased headcount  increased consulting expenses of approximately  and increased expenses associated with pre clinical studies of  the decrease of  in from was principally due to decreased expenses related to research licenses  lower non employee stock based compensation expense of  decreased clinical related expenses of  primarily related to our diabetic neuropathy program  and decreased allocated facility expenses of  the decrease is partially offset increased expenses for laboratory supplies of approximately  increased external research expenses of approximately  and increased consulting expenses of approximately  our current research and development programs are focused on the advancement of our zfp tf technology for several potential applications 
among these are zfp therapeutics for cardiovascular disease  neurological disorders  cancer and monogenic diseases  zfp engineered cell lines  protein production and zfp tfs and zfns for applications in agricultural biotechnology 
below is a summary of our programs partially funded by collaborators and the development phase of the leading application program collaborator stage zfp technology to modify the genomes or alter the protein expression of plant cells  plants  or plant cell cultures dow agrosciences research zfp engineered cell lines for the manufacture of protein pharmaceuticals pfizer research marketing 
table of contents below is a summary of our programs funded internally and the development stage of the leading application internal programs program stage zfp therapeutics clinical preclinical research zfp tf engineered cell lines for the manufacture of protein pharmaceuticals research due to the early stage of our various internal research and development projects  we do not track costs associated with its internal projects on a project by project basis 
drug development is inherently uncertain and the successful completion of our development programs is subject to numerous technological challenges and risks and we cannot presently estimate anticipated completion dates for any of our programs 
material cash inflows associated with the sale of products  if any  which result from our research efforts are not expected for at least five years 
see risk factors our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process  and if these potential products are not approved  we will not be able to commercialize these products and our gene regulation technology is relatively new  and if we are unable to use this technology in all our intended applications  it would limit our revenue opportunities 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  stock based compensation expenses  professional fees  allocated facilities costs  expenses for patent prosecution and other general corporate expenses 
as we pursue commercial development of our therapeutic leads  we expect the business aspects of the company to become more complex 
we may be required in the future to add personnel and incur additional costs related to the maturity of our business 
general and administrative expenses were million during  million in and million in the increase of million in was principally due to increased professional services expenses of approximately  primarily patent prosecution related  and  related to stock based compensation due to the adoption of sfas no

table of contents we incurred net operating losses in  and  and consequently did not pay any federal or state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  payments from corporate collaborators  federal government research grants and financing activities such as a bank line of credit 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  investments and interest receivable totaling million 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in  and million in in all periods  net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to funding of net operating losses 
during  the use of cash related to our net operating loss of million  net of non cash charges of million and net decrease of million in net operating assets and liabilities 
non cash charges include million related to issuance of common stock for edwards asset purchase  million related to stock based compensation expense related to fasr and amortization of premium discount on marketable securities of  the net decreases in operating assets and liabilities are mainly attributable to decrease in deferred revenue of million partially offset by net decreases in asset balances of  during  the use of cash related to our net operating loss of million net of non cash charges of  and net increases in operating assets and liabilities of million 
non cash charges include amortization of premium discount on marketable securities of  and  stock based compensation expense 
the net increases in operating assets and liabilities is due to net increase in liability balances of million  principally due to an increase in deferred revenue of million  primarily related to the receipt of a license payment of million during the fourth quarter of per the terms of the research license and commercial option agreement with das 
during  the use of cash related to the net operating loss of million  partially offset by non cash charges and net increases in asset balances of million and by amortization of premium discount on marketable securities of  net cash provided by used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in cash was used during these periods to purchase investments and property and equipment and was offset by the maturities and sale of available for sale securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and  in in june  in an underwritten public offering and pursuant to an effective registration statement  we sold  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriter s discount 
during  the company completed a registered direct offering to institutional and strategic investors for a total of  shares of common stock at a price of per share to the investors  resulting in net proceeds to sangamo of approximately million 
all other cash provided by financing activities for  and was solely related to proceeds from issuance of common stock related to stock options exercises 
while we expect our rate of cash usage to increase in the future  in particular  to support our product development endeavors  we believe that the available cash resources  funds received from corporate collaborators  strategic partners and federal government research grants will be sufficient to finance our operations through we may need to raise additional capital to fund our zfp therapeutic development activities 
additional capital may not be available in terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  our business and our ability to develop our technology and our zfp therapeutic products would be harmed 
there is no provision for income taxes because we have incurred losses 
as of december   sangamo had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in the years through the company also has state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which expire in the years through the company also has federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal research credits will begin to expire in the year through and the state research credits have no expiration date 
use of the net operating loss may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss before use 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases license obligations total contractual obligations operating leases consist of base rents for facilities we occupy in richmond  california 
license obligations consist of ongoing license maintenance fees  milestones and royalties due from sales of zfp tfs 
recent accounting pronouncements in september the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas the standard provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
the standard applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas must be adopted prospectively as of the beginning of the year it is initially applied 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are still evaluating what impact  if any  the adoption of this standard will have on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which is a change in accounting for income taxes 
fin specifies how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized  measured  and derecognized in financial statements  requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters  specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the balance sheet  and provides transition and interim period guidance  among other provisions 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of fin on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and investments 
the investments are available for sale 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default and market risks 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible within these guidelines 
we invest excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only investment grade securities 
the portfolio includes marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
all investments have a fixed interest rate and are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
if market interest rates were to increase by one percent from december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by less than  the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
we recognized a gain on foreign currency translation of  in  loss of  and gain of  on foreign currency translation in and  respectively
