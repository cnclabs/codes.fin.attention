item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to acquiring  developing and commercializing prescription drugs used in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal diseases  which are those affecting the digestive tract 
our strategy is to identify and acquire rights to products that we believe have potential for near term regulatory approval or are already approved  apply our regulatory  product development  and sales and marketing expertise to commercialize these products  and use our member specialty sales and marketing team focused on high prescribing us gastroenterologists to sell our products 
in september we acquired exclusive marketing rights for sanvar from debiovision inc and paid an up front payment of million 
sanvar is currently undergoing a confirmatory phase iii trial for the treatment of acute esophageal variceal bleeding secondary to portal hypertension 
esophageal variceal bleeding  or evb  is a life threatening and frequent complication of late stage liver cirrhosis 
sanvar  if approved  will be the only approved treatment for evb in the united states 
in february  we purchased the us prescription pharmaceutical product rights to pepcid oral suspension and diuril oral suspension from merck co  inc pepcid oral suspension is a widely known prescription pharmaceutical product indicated for several gastrointestinal indications including the treatment of duodenal ulcer  benign gastric ulcer and gastro esophageal reflux disease 
the acquisition reflects the ongoing execution of the company s strategy to expand and diversify revenue 
pepcid oral suspension achieved net product sales in the us of approximately million in pepcid oral suspension and diuril oral suspension  both liquid formulations of their solid dosage form counterparts  compete in an approximately million market that is concentrated in pediatric and hospitalized patient populations 
we anticipate launching a hospital sales force at the time of the sanvar approval 
in addition to selling sanvar  pepcid oral suspension and diuril oral suspension  this focused sales force will work with our office based representatives to ensure that prescribers  managed care groups  hospital formulary committees and all other relevant parties are fully apprised of the utility and availability of xifaxan and our other drugs 
we generate revenue primarily by selling our products  prescription drugs  to pharmaceutical wholesalers 
these direct customers resell and distribute our products to and through pharmacies to patients who have had our products prescribed by doctors 
because demand for our products originates with doctors  our sales force calls on high prescribing specialists  primarily gastroenterologists  and we monitor new and total prescriptions for our products as key performance indicators for our business 
prescriptions result in our products being used by patients  requiring our direct customers to purchase more products to replenish their inventory 
however  our revenue might fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to other factors  such as increased buying by wholesalers in anticipation of a price increase or because of the introduction of new products 
revenue could be less than anticipated in subsequent quarters as wholesalers increased inventory is used up 
for example  wholesalers made initial stocking purchases of osmoprep when it was launched in second quarter and moviprep when it was launched in the third quarter of also  colazal revenue was slightly lower than in the comparable periods in even though prescriptions increased in in december  we established our own field sales force to market colazal in the united states 
currently  this sales force has approximately sales representatives in the field 
although the creation of an independent sales organization involved substantial costs  we believe that the financial returns from our direct product sales have been and will continue to be more favorable to us than those from the indirect sale of products through marketing partners 
in addition  we intend to enter into distribution relationships outside the united states and in markets where a larger sales organization is appropriate 
critical accounting policies general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments 
table of contents that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales of our products  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets and legal issues 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results might differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
methodologies used and assumptions selected by management in making these estimates  as well as the related disclosures  have been reviewed by and discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
together  sab  and fasb statement no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists sfas 
sab states that revenue should not be recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
sfas states that revenue from sales transactions where the buyer has the right to return the product shall be recognized at the time of sale only if the seller s price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale  the buyer has paid the seller  or the buyer is obligated to pay the seller and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer s obligation to the seller would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product  the buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by the seller  the seller does not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer  and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
we recognize revenues for product sales at the time title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer  and the other criteria of sab and sfas are satisfied  which is generally at the time products are shipped 
our net product revenue represents our total revenues less allowances for customer credits  including estimated discounts  rebates  chargebacks  and product returns 
we establish allowances for estimated rebates  chargebacks and product returns based on numerous qualitative and quantitative factors  including the number of and specific contractual terms of agreements with customers  estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel  historical rebates  chargebacks and returns of products  direct communication with customers  anticipated introduction of competitive products or generics  anticipated pricing strategy changes by salix and or its competitors  analysis of prescription data gathered by a third party prescription data provider  the impact of changes in state and federal regulations  and estimated remaining shelf life of products 
in our analyses  we use prescription data purchased from a third party data provider to develop estimates of historical inventory channel pull through 
we utilize an internal analysis to compare historical net product shipments to estimated historical prescriptions written 
based on that analysis  we develop an estimate of the quantity of product in 
table of contents the channel which may be subject to various rebate  chargeback and product return exposures 
at least quarterly for each product line  we prepare an internal estimate of ending inventory units in the distribution channel by adding estimated inventory in the channel at the beginning of the period  plus net product shipments for the period  less estimated prescriptions written for the period 
based on that analysis  we develop an estimate of the quantity of product in the channel that might be subject to various rebate  chargeback and product return exposures 
this is done for each product line by applying a rate of historical activity for rebates  chargebacks and product returns  adjusted for relevant quantitative and qualitative factors discussed above  to the potential exposed product estimated to be in the distribution channel 
internal forecasts that are utilized to calculate the estimated number of months in the channel are regularly adjusted based on input from members of our sales  marketing and operations groups 
the adjusted forecasts take into account numerous factors including  but not limited to  new product introductions  direct communication with customers and potential product expiry issues 
consistent with industry practice  we periodically offer promotional discounts to our existing customer base 
these discounts are calculated as a percentage of the current published list price and are treated as off invoice allowances 
accordingly  the discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period that the program is offered 
in addition to promotional discounts  at the time that we implement a price increase  we generally offer our existing customer base an opportunity to purchase a limited quantity of product at the previous list price 
shipments resulting from these programs generally are not in excess of ordinary levels  therefore  we recognize the related revenue upon shipment and include the shipments in estimating our various product related allowances 
in the event we determine that these shipments represent purchases of inventory in excess of ordinary levels for a given wholesaler  the potential impact on product returns exposure would be specifically evaluated and reflected as a reduction in revenue at the time of such shipments 
allowances for estimated rebates and chargebacks were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these allowances reflect an estimate of our liability for items such as rebates due to various governmental organizations under the medicare medicaid regulations  rebates due to managed care organizations under specific contracts and chargebacks due to various organizations purchasing certain of our products through federal contracts and or group purchasing agreements 
we estimate our liability for rebates and chargebacks at each reporting period based on a methodology of applying the relevant quantitative and qualitative assumptions discussed above 
due to the subjectivity of our accrual estimates for rebates and chargebacks  we prepare various sensitivity analyses to ensure our final estimate is within a reasonable range as well as review prior period activity to ensure that our methodology continues to be appropriate 
had a change in one or more variables in the analyses utilization rates  contract modifications  etc 
resulted in an additional percentage point change in the trailing average of estimated chargeback and rebate activity in  we would have recorded an adjustment to revenues of approximately million  or  for the year 
allowances for product returns were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these allowances reflect an estimate of our liability for product that may be returned by the original purchaser in accordance with our stated return policy 
we estimate our liability for product returns at each reporting period based on historical return rates  the estimated inventory in the channel  and the other factors discussed above 
due to the subjectivity of our accrual estimates for product returns  we prepare various sensitivity analyses to ensure our final estimate is within a reasonable range as well as review prior period activity to ensure that our methodology is still reasonable 
a change in assumptions that resulted in a change in forecasted return rates would have resulted in a change in total product returns liability at december  of approximately million and a corresponding change in net product revenue of less than 
for the years ended december  and  our absolute exposure for rebates  chargebacks and product returns has grown primarily as a result of increased sales of our existing products  the approval of new products and the acquisition of products 
accordingly  reductions to revenue and corresponding increases to allowance accounts have likewise increased 
the provision for these revenue reducing items as a percentage of gross product revenue in the year ended december  and was and for rebates  chargebacks and discounts and was and for product returns  respectively 

table of contents inventories inventory at december  consisted of million of raw materials  million of work in process  and million of finished goods 
inventory at december  consisted of million of raw materials  million of work in process and million of finished goods 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out cost method or market 
in evaluating whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand and in the distribution channel  estimated time required to sell such inventory  remaining shelf life  and current and expected market conditions  including levels of competition 
as of december   we had recorded inventory reserves totaling million  compared to million as of december   to reduce inventories to their net realizable value 
the decrease in inventory reserves from to is primarily the result of a one time write off of million of obsolete inventories in associated with the initial launch of xifaxan 
refer to schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts for a roll forward of the inventory allowance 
intangible assets and goodwill our intangible assets consist of license agreements  product rights and other identifiable intangible assets  which result from product and business acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
when we make product acquisitions that include license agreements  product rights and other identifiable intangible assets  we record the purchase price of such intangibles  along with the value of the product related liabilities that we assume  as intangible assets 
we allocate the aggregate purchase price to the fair value of the various tangible and intangible assets in order to determine the appropriate carrying value of the acquired assets and then amortize the cost of the intangible assets as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the estimated economic useful life of the related assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable 
some factors that we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
in assessing the recoverability of its intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the intangible assets we must determine the fair value of the intangible assets 
if the fair value of the intangible assets is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we review goodwill for impairment in accordance statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets at least annually  and we review all long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in november  we acquired from aaipharma llc the exclusive right to sell  and milligram dosage strengths of azathioprine tablets in north america under the name azasan for million 
the purchase price was fully allocated to product rights and related intangibles and is being amortized over a period of ten years 
although azasan does not have any patent protection  we believe ten years is an appropriate amortization period based on established product history and management s experience 
at december  and  accumulated amortization for the azasan intangible was million and million  respectively 
in june  we acquired the exclusive us rights to anusol hc hydrocortisone cream usp  anusol hc mg suppository hydrocortisone acetate  proctocort cream hydrocortisone cream usp and proctocort suppositories hydrocortisone acetate rectal suppositories  mg from king pharmaceuticals  inc for million 
the purchase price was fully allocated to product rights and related intangibles and is being amortized over a period of ten years 
although anusol hc and proctocort do not have any patent protection  we believe ten years is an appropriate amortization period based on established product history and management s experience 
at december  and  accumulated amortization for the king product intangibles was million and million  respectively 

table of contents in september  we acquired inkine pharmaceutical company  inc for million 
we allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development  million to net assets acquired and million to specifically identifiable product rights and related intangibles with an ongoing economic benefit to us 
we allocated the remaining million to goodwill  which is not being amortized 
the inkine product rights and related intangibles are being amortized over an average period of years  which we believe is an appropriate amortization period due to the product s patent protections and the estimated economic lives of the product rights and related intangibles 
at december  and  accumulated amortization for the inkine intangibles was million and million  respectively 
in december  we entered into a license and supply agreement with norgine bv  granting salix the exclusive right to sell a patented protected  liquid peg bowel cleansing product  nrl  in the united states 
in august  we received food and drug administration marketing approval for nrl under the branded name of moviprep 
in january the united states patent office issued a patent providing coverage to september  in august  pursuant to the terms of the agreement  salix made a million payment to norgine 
we are amortizing the milestone payment over a period of years  which we believe is an appropriate amortization period due to the product s patent protection and the estimated economic life of the related intangible 
at december   accumulated amortization for the moviprep intangible was million 
allowance for uncollectible accounts based on a review of specific customer balances  industry experience and the current economic environment  we currently reserve for specific past due accounts that may represent collection concerns plus a percentage of our outstanding trade accounts receivable balance as an allowance for uncollectible accounts  which at december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
refer to schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts for a roll forward of the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
investments we consider all investments that have a maturity of greater than three months and less than one year to be short term investments 
all securities with maturities beyond one year are considered long term investments 
our investments as of december  consist of government agency and high grade corporate bonds and are classified as available for sale 
all available for sale investments are classified as current  as we have the ability to use them for current operations and investing purposes 
as of december   all of our investments have matured 
research and development in accordance with its policy  we expense research and development costs  both internal and externally contracted  as incurred 
due to increased development activity levels and the way in which many of our long term development contracts are structured  we conducted a review of our process of estimating research and development expenses during the first quarter of based on that review  we refined our process of estimating certain externally contracted development activities to more closely align the related expense with the level of progress achieved and services received during the period 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  the refined estimation process was implemented in the first quarter of as of december   the prepaid amount related to on going research and development activities was million 
this prepaid amount  which will be charged to expense in future periods as the related research and development activities are performed under the contracts  resulted in a reduction of research and development expense for the year ended december  and a corresponding increase in income from operations of million  and net income of million  or per diluted share 
the refined estimation process will continue to be applied on the same basis in future periods 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
revenues for the year ended december  consisted solely of net product revenues 
revenues for the year ended 
table of contents december  included net product revenues of million and revenues from collaborative agreements of million 
revenues for the years ended december  included net product revenues of million and revenues from collaborative agreements of million 
we expect that future revenues will consist solely or primarily of net product revenue 
net product revenue increases from to were due to increased sales of xifaxan and visicol  and the launch of osmoprep and moviprep during the second and fourth quarters of  respectively  offset by decreased colazal sales 
net product revenue increases from to were due to increased sales of colazal  xifaxan  azasan  anusol hc and proctocort  and the addition of visicol during the fourth quarter of increased sales from to were primarily driven by prescription growth for xifaxan of  respectively  as well as price increases for all of our products 
colazal prescriptions increased year over year from to  thus the decrease in colazal revenue reflects a draw down of wholesaler inventories in  offset by price increases of 
as planned  colazal s contribution as a percentage of total product revenue incrementally decreased during due to the expansion of our product portfolio with the launch of our bowel cleansing products and as xifaxan sales continued to ramp up 
colazal sales contributed of total product revenue for compared to for and for we expect colazal s contribution as a percentage of total product revenue will continue to moderate going forward 
increases in revenue reducing items from to were due primarily to increases in allowances for managed care agreements as a result of increased product sales and the allowance for product returns associated with colazal  visicol  anusol and proctocort 
increased sales from to were primarily driven by prescription growth for colazal and xifaxan of and  respectively  as well as price increases for all of our products and the introduction of the colazal count and xifaxan count bottles 
increases in revenue reducing items from to were due primarily to increases in allowances for managed care agreements as a result of increased product sales and the allowance for product returns associated with the commercial launch of xifaxan 
total costs and expenses were million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
excluding the september one time charge of million for the write off of in process research and development associated with the acquisition of inkine  our higher operating expenses in absolute terms from to were due primarily to increased research and development activities  increased cost of products sold related to the corresponding increase in product revenues  and increased selling  general and administrative expenses due to the expansion of our sales force in connection with the inkine merger and the launches of osmoprep and moviprep 
higher operating expenses from to  excluding the one time charge of million write off of in process research and development  were due to on going studies pursuing additional indications for rifaximin and on going phase iii studies for granulated mesalamine and commercial development activities 
we recognized cost of products sold of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
gross margin on total product revenue was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of products sold from to was due primarily to increased sales of xifaxan and visicol and the additions of osmoprep and moviprep during the second and third quarters  respectively 
the increases in cost of products sold and decreased gross margin from to was due primarily to increased sales of colazal and xifaxan and a one time write off of million of obsolete inventories associated with the initial launch of xifaxan 
cost of products sold does not include amortization of product rights and intangibles 
refer to critical accounting policies intangible assets and goodwill above 
license fees and costs related to collaborative agreements were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and relate primarily to payments made to debiovision  cedars sinai  biorex and alfa wassermann under the terms of their license agreements 
research and development expense was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses from to was due primarily to the expansion of our colazal life cycle management program through initiatives to strengthen and support our mg balsalazide tablet submission  our colazal pediatric exclusivity filing and the costs associated with ongoing late stage studies to expand the xifaxan label 
the increase in research and development expense from to was primarily due to on going studies pursuing additional indications for rifaximin  on going phase iii studies for granulated mesalamine and expenses associated with licensing fees 
to date  we have incurred research and 
table of contents development expense of approximately million for balsalazide  million for rifaximin and million for granulated mesalamine 
due to the risks and uncertainties of the drug development and regulatory approval process  research and development expenditures are difficult to forecast and subject to unexpected increases 
as disclosed in note in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements  due to increased development activities and the way in which many of our long term development contracts are structured  we have refined our process of estimating development activities to more closely align expenses with the level of progress achieved 
we expect research and development costs to increase in absolute terms as we pursue additional indications and formulations for balsalazide and rifaximin  and continue to develop granulated mesalamine  and if and when we acquire new products 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in absolute terms  the increase from to was primarily due to launch and training activities associated with our two new purgative products  osmoprep and moviprep  and the expansion of our sales force and infrastructure subsequent to the inkine merger 
the increase from to was primarily due to increased commercial development activities which include expansion of the sales force and inkine merger related expenses 
interest and other income  net was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase from to and from to was primarily due to higher average daily cash balances and increased short term interest rates 
income tax expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively  due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   and  we had us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these carryforwards will expire on various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
utilization of the federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code 
the annual limitation might result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a presentation of our quarterly results of operations for the years ended december  and liquidity and capital resources from inception until first achieving profitability in the third quarter of  we financed product development  operations and capital expenditures primarily from public and private sales of equity securities and from funding arrangements with collaborative partners 
since launching colazal in january  net product revenue has been a growing source of cash  a trend that we expect to continue 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to million as of december  net cash provided by operating activities was million and million in and  respectively  and cash used in operating activities was million in positive operating cash flows in was primarily attributable to increased earnings  partially offset by increased accounts receivable balances due to increased sales in december and decreased accounts payable and accrued liability balances

we might seek additional debt or equity financing or both to fund our operations or acquisitions 
if we incur more debt  we might be restricted in our ability to raise additional capital and might be subject to financial and restrictive covenants 
if we issued additional equity  our stockholders could suffer dilution 
we might also enter into additional collaborative arrangements that could provide us with additional funding in the form of equity  debt  licensing  milestone and or royalty payments 
we might not be able to enter into such arrangements or raise any additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which is an interpretation of sfas accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
the statement provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas references fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
the statement applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
sfas does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
it is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not believe adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin  sab  financial statements considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab provides guidance on the consideration of prior year misstatements in determining whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated 
the sec staff indicates that registrants should quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements  including both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements  on the current year financial statements 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  registrants may either restate their financials for any material misstatements arising from the application of sab or recognize a cumulative effect of applying sab within the current year opening balance in retained earnings 
our adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
