business overview we are a biotechnology company specializing in the detailed structural analysis of complex mixture drugs 
we apply our technology to the development of generic versions of complex drug products as well as to the discovery and development of novel drugs 
through detailed analysis of the molecular structure of complex sugars and other complex mixtures  we believe our proprietary technology enables us to define the specific sequences contained in complex drugs  including those structures that had previously not been described due to a lack of available technology 
we apply our technology to the discovery and development of novel drugs through gaining a deeper understanding of the role of sugars in disease  such as the roles that complex sugars play in cellular function  disease and drug action based on our analytical capabilities 
with our capabilities  we have developed a diversified pipeline of complex generic and novel drug candidates  as well as a novel drug discovery program 
our business strategy is to apply our technology to develop generic versions of complex drugs  such as m enoxaparin and m  to generate product revenue which will contribute to funding our novel drug discovery and development programs 
over the long term  we expect to generate additional value by leveraging our understanding of sugars to create novel therapeutics  which address critical unmet medical needs in a wide range of disease areas  including oncology  cardiovascular disease  infectious disease  inflammation and immunology 
our most advanced product candidate  m enoxaparin  is designed to be a technology enabled generic version of lovenox  a widely prescribed low molecular weight heparin  or lmwh 
in  we formed a collaboration  the sandoz collaboration  with sandoz nv and sandoz inc  collectively sandoz  affiliates of novartis ag  to jointly develop  manufacture and commercialize m enoxaparin 
on august   sandoz submitted an abbreviated new drug application  or anda  to the fda for m enoxaparin  which was amended in to include a paragraph iv certification stating that sanofi aventis patents listed in the fda s listing of approved drug products  the orange book  for lovenox are  among other things  invalid or unenforceable 
in july  we entered into a series of agreements with novartis ag and sandoz ag  including a memorandum of understanding  or mou  with sandoz ag  collectively referred to as the sandoz collaboration 
under the terms of the mou  we expanded the geographic markets covered by our collaboration efforts related to m enoxaparin to include the european union and further agreed to exclusively collaborate with sandoz ag on the development and commercialization of three other biosimilar and complex generic products 
since our inception in may  we have incurred annual net losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we recognized net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we develop our product candidates  expand our research and development activities and prepare for the commercial launch of our product candidates 
additionally  we plan to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions or licensing of rights to additional technologies  products or assets that fit within our growth strategy 
accordingly  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and then maintain profitability 
since our inception  we have had no revenues from product sales 
our revenues for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively  have been derived from our sandoz collaboration and primarily consist of amounts earned by us for reimbursement by sandoz of research and development services and development costs for m enoxaparin 
in june  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock  the net proceeds of which were million after deducting underwriters discounts and expenses 
in july  we raised million in a follow on public offering  net of expenses  from the sale and issuance of  shares of our common stock 
in connection with the sandoz collaboration  the company sold  shares of common stock to novartis pharma ag for an aggregate purchase price of million 
to date  we have devoted substantially all of our capital resources to the research and development of our product candidates 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries in which we compete are undergoing  and are expected to continue to undergo  rapid and significant technological change 
we expect competition to intensify as technological advances are made or new biotechnology products are introduced 
to become and remain profitable  we must succeed in rapidly developing and commercializing drugs with significant market potential 
this will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities for which we are only in the preliminary stages developing drugs  obtaining regulatory approval for them  and manufacturing  marketing and selling them 
we have invested a significant portion of our time  financial resources and collaboration efforts in the development of our most advanced product candidate  m enoxaparin 
our successful development and commercialization of m enoxaparin  in collaboration with sandoz  depends on several factors  including using our technology to demonstrate successfully to the fda that m enoxaparin is therapeutically equivalent to lovenox  meeting any other fda requirements for marketing approval  successfully manufacturing m enoxaparin in a consistent  cost effective and reproducible manner and at a commercial scale  achieving a favorable outcome in any patent litigation with sanofi aventis relating to enoxaparin  or a third party achieving a favorable outcome in the pending patent litigation with sanofi aventis  achieving market acceptance of m enoxaparin in the medical community and with third party payors  and fda approval of other generic versions of lovenox 
financial operations overview revenue we have not yet generated any revenue from product sales and are uncertain whether or not we will generate any revenue from the sale of products over the next several years 
we have recognized  in the aggregate  million of revenue from our inception through december  this revenue was derived entirely from our sandoz collaboration 
we will seek to generate revenue from a combination of research and development payments  profit sharing payments  milestone payments and royalties in connection with our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration and similar future collaborative or strategic relationships 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of research and development and other payments received under our collaborative or strategic relationships  and the amount and timing of payments we receive upon the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
research and development research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in identifying  developing and testing product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  license fees  consulting fees  contract research and manufacturing  and the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
the following summarizes our primary research and development programs development programs m enoxaparin our most advanced product candidate  m enoxaparin  is designed to be a generic version of lovenox 
lovenox is a widely prescribed lmwh used for the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis  or dvt  and to support the treatment of acute coronary syndromes  or acs 
under our sandoz collaboration  we work with sandoz exclusively to develop  manufacture and commercialize m enoxaparin in the us and sandoz is responsible for funding substantially all of the us related m enoxaparin development  regulatory  legal and commercialization costs 
the total cost of development and commercialization  and the timing of m enoxaparin marketing  are subject to uncertainties relating to the development  regulatory approval and legal processes 
in accordance with our sandoz collaboration  sandoz submitted andas to the fda for m enoxaparin in syringe and vial forms seeking approval to market m enoxaparin in the united states 
the syringe anda was subsequently amended in to include a paragraph iv certification stating that sanofi aventis patents listed in the orange book for lovenox are  among other things  invalid and unenforceable 
the fda is currently reviewing the m enoxaparin andas  including our manufacturing data and technology and characterization methodology 
in parallel  and in collaboration with sandoz  we are focused on activities related to supporting the fda s review of the anda and preparing for the commercialization of m enoxaparin  if and when approved  by advancing manufacturing  supply chain  and sales and marketing objectives 
our sandoz collaboration expanded our collaboration efforts related to m enoxaparin to include the european union 
under the sandoz collaboration  we will share certain development  regulatory  legal and commercialization costs as well as a portion of the profits  if any 
m m is a novel anticoagulant drug that was rationally designed with the goal of providing improved clinical anticoagulant properties to support the treatment of patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndromes  or acs  and stable angina 
we believe that m has the potential to provide baseline anticoagulant therapy to treat patients with acs or stable angina who require a coronary intervention  as well as those acs patients who are medically managed  or do not require intervention in order to treat their coronary attack 
m is designed to be a reversible and monitorable anticoagulant that can be administered intravenously or subcutaneously  and has a pharmacokinetic profile similar to a lmwh 
we believe that the properties of m have the potential to provide greater flexibility than other therapies presently used to treat patients diagnosed with acs and stable angina 
in july  we filed our investigational new drug application  or ind  with the fda for our m intravenous injection product  and in october began phase i clinical trials 
m m is targeted to be a technology enabled generic version of copaxone  a complex drug consisting of a mixture of polypeptide chains 
copaxone is indicated for reduction of the frequency of relapses in patients with relapse remitting multiple sclerosis 
multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammation and neurodegeneration 
in north america  copaxone is marketed through teva neuroscience llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of teva pharmaceutical industries ltd  and distributed by sanofi aventis 
teva and sanofi aventis have an additional collaborative arrangement for the marketing of copaxone in europe and other markets  under which copaxone is either co promoted with teva or is marketed solely by sanofi aventis 
under our sandoz collaboration  we and sandoz jointly develop  manufacture and commercialize m we are responsible for funding substantially all of the us related m development costs  with sandoz responsible for regulatory  legal and commercialization costs 
outside of the us  we and sandoz share equally the development costs  with sandoz responsible for commercialization and legal costs 
glycoproteins our glycoprotein program is focused on extending our technology for the analysis of complex sugars to glycoproteins 
the goal of the program is to facilitate the development of generic or biosimilar versions of major marketed glycoprotein drugs 
in addition  we believe we can assist pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in developing improved versions of their branded glycoprotein products by analyzing and modifying the sugar structures contained in the products 
many glycoprotein drugs have been approved by the fda under the biological licensing application  or bla  regulatory pathway 
bla approved complex mixture products include glycoproteins such as erythropoietin  blood clotting factors and interferon beta 
these glycoprotein drugs contain branched sugars that vary from molecule to molecule 
these sugars impart specific biological properties to the glycoprotein drug and can often comprise a significant portion of the mass of a molecule 
however  many of these products have not been thoroughly characterized due to inadequacies of standard technology 
the goal of our glycoprotein program is to facilitate the development of generic or biosimilar versions of major marketed glycoprotein drugs 
under our sandoz collaboration  we are currently applying our technology to develop two follow on proteins in partnership with sandoz 
we refer to these two product candidates as m and m m dalteparin m dalteparin is targeted to be a technology enabled generic version of fragmin  a lmwh product 
fragmin is indicated for the prevention of dvt and selected indications in acs 
in september  eisai inc  a us pharmaceutical subsidiary of eisai co 
ltd  obtained us promotion rights to fragmin from pfizer inc fragmin is marketed by pfizer in europe and by kissei pharmaceutical co  ltd 
in japan 
through our technology  we believe we have the ability to analyze fragmin and develop a generic product has the same active ingredients as fragmin 
the m dalteparin program has been reprioritized in light of other more commercially attractive opportunities 
discovery program we are also applying our analytical capabilities to drug discovery 
our discovery program is focused on the role that complex sugars play in biological systems  including regulating the development and progression of disease 
our initial focus is in the area of cancer  which is a disease characterized by unregulated cell growth  where we are seeking to discover sugar sequences with anti cancer properties for development as therapeutics 
sugars play a part in the conversion of normal cells into cancerous cells  the regulation of tumor growth and tumor invasion and metastasis 
we believe that our technology can provide us with a better understanding of the role of sugars in disease  enabling us to discover novel sugar therapeutics  as well as to discover new disease mechanisms that can be targeted with small molecule drugs 
we previously were applying our technology to the pulmonary delivery of proteins 
however  in order to focus our resources on our key programs  we discontinued our drug delivery program during general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  legal  accounting  investor relations  business development and human resource functions 
other costs include facility and insurance costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses and professional fees and other expenses for legal and accounting services 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue revenue for was million  compared with million for and million for the increase of million from to and million from to is entirely attributable to our sandoz collaboration 
these revenues consist of amounts earned by us for payment by sandoz of research and development services and reimbursement of development costs for m enoxaparin and amortization of the initial payment received under our sandoz collaboration 
the increase in revenues was the result of increased reimbursable expenditures associated with preparing for the potential commercial launch of m enoxaparin in the us we have not recognized any revenue to date from the sandoz collaboration 
we will commence amortization of the million representing the excess of the purchase price of per share of common stock purchased by novartis pharma ag over the closing price of per share on july   the last trading day of our common stock before execution of the sandoz collaboration  as collaboration revenue when we can reasonably estimate the period of ongoing involvement or performance obligations under the sandoz collaboration 
we expect to be able make such an estimate when a definitive collaboration and license agreement is executed with sandoz ag 
research and development research and development expense for was million  compared with million in and million in the increase of million from to principally resulted from an increase of million in manufacturing and process development costs and research conducted by third parties  million in personnel and related costs  million in stock based compensation  of which million is related to the adoption of sfas r  million in laboratory expenses  million in facilities costs  million in consultant costs and million in depreciation expense 
the increase of million from to principally resulted from an increase of million in personnel and related costs  million in manufacturing and research provided by third parties  million in facilities costs  and million in consultant costs and million in depreciation expense 
the lengthy process of securing fda approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall 
accordingly  we cannot currently estimate  with any degree of certainty  the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on our product candidates prior to their regulatory approval  if such approval is ever granted 
as a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of any approvals  we are currently unable to estimate when  if ever  our product candidates will generate revenues and cash flows 
we expect future research and development expenses to increase in support of our product candidates 
the following table summarizes the primary components of our research and development expenditures for our principal research and development programs for the years ended december    and research and development expense in thousands development programs discovery programs other research total research and development expense our increase in expenditures on development programs of million from to was primarily related to preclinical and toxicology work intended to support the m ind filing  commencement of our phase i clinical studies for m  manufacturing and professional fees related to our m enoxaparin program and the expenses of our m program 
our increase in expenditures on development programs of million from to was primarily due the increased personnel and manufacturing costs of our m enoxaparin program 
the increases in expenditures on our discovery programs from to and from to were primarily related to increased expenditures to support our disease biology and drug delivery programs 
we discontinued our drug delivery program in the increases in other research expense from to and from to were primarily due to an increase in headcount and headcount related costs relating to general technology development and support activities 
general and administrative general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and million in general and administrative expense increased by million from to due primarily to an increase of million in stock based compensation  of which million is related to the adoption of sfas r  increases of million in professional fees and other legal expenses and million in personnel and related costs 
general and administrative expense increased by million from to due primarily to an increase of million in professional fees  including legal  consulting  accounting and other professional fees  million in personnel and related costs  million in insurance and million in office and computer supplies 
we anticipate additional increases in general and administrative expenses to support our research and development programs 
these increases will likely include the hiring of additional personnel 
we intend to continue to incur increased internal and external legal and business development costs to support our various product development efforts  which can vary from period to period 
interest income interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of million from to was primarily due to higher average investment balances as a result of the proceeds from the issuance of common stock to novartis pharma ag in september and from our follow on public offering in july the increase of million from to was primarily due to higher average investment balances as a result of the proceeds from our follow on public offering in july interest expense interest expense was million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of million from to and million from to is primarily due to additional amounts drawn from our equipment line of credit during and liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through the sale of equity securities  payments from our sandoz collaboration  borrowings from our lines of credit  and capital lease obligations 
since our inception  we have received net proceeds of million from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock 
in june  we completed our initial public offering and raised net proceeds of million 
in july  we completed a follow on public offering and raised net proceeds of million 
in september  we received net proceeds of million from novartis pharma ag s purchase of  shares of our common stock in connection with the sandoz collaboration 
as of december   we have received a cumulative total of million from our sandoz collaboration  million from debt financing  million from capital lease obligations  million from our landlord for leasehold improvements related to our corporate facility  and additional funds from interest income 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
in addition  we also hold million in restricted cash  which serves as collateral for a letter of credit related to our facility leases 
during the years ended december   and  our operating activities used million  million and million  respectively 
the use of cash was primarily a result of net losses associated with our research and development activities and administrative costs 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total through through after license maintenance obligations short and long term line of credit obligation capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations after  the annual obligations  which extend indefinitely  are approximately million per year 
we anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least however  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  accrued expenses and certain equity instruments 
prior to our initial public offering  we also evaluated our estimates and judgments regarding the fair valuation assigned to our common stock 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue we record revenue on an accrual basis as it is earned and when amounts are considered collectible 
revenues received in advance of performance obligations or in cases where we have a continuing obligation to perform services are deferred and recognized over the performance period 
revenues from milestone payments that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process are recorded when the milestone is achieved 
contract revenues are recorded as the services are performed 
when we are required to defer revenue  the period over which such revenue should be recognized is subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the collaborative agreement 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and then estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include contract service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs  which have begun to be incurred  or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
stock based compensation we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r  effective january  under the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation expense in our operations  and accordingly the adoption of sfas no 
r fair value method has had and will continue to have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including stock price volatility and expected term of an option 
changes in market price directly affect volatility and could cause future stock based compensation expense to vary significantly in future reporting periods 
the adoption of sfas r on january  resulted in the recognition of stock based compensation expense of million for the year ended december  at december   the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options was million 
the cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
due to our limited historical share options exercise data and the characteristics of our share options  we follow the simplified method of estimating the expected term  as described in the us securities and exchange commission  or sec  issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payments  or sab the expected term is derived from the average midpoint between vesting and the contractual term 
upon adoption of sfas r  we validated our estimates and assumptions used in the black scholes model with an independent third party having the relevant expertise in valuation methodologies 
we update these assumptions on a quarterly basis to reflect recent historical data 
additionally  we are required to estimate forfeiture rates to estimate the number of shares that will vest in a period to which the fair value is applied 
prior to january   we accounted for employee stock options under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and provided pro forma disclosures of net loss attributable and net loss per share allocable to common stockholders as if we had adopted the fair value based method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact of adoption  but does not currently believe that adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  or sab sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity in practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
sab requires that registrants quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstated amount that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab must be implemented by the end of our fiscal year we do not currently believe that the adoption of this standard will result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas sfas provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable 
sfas also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the methods and the assumptions used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measures on earnings 
sfas will be effective for our fiscal year  although early adoption is permitted 
we are currently assessing the potential effect of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our current investment policy is to maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of us money market and high grade corporate securities  directly or through managed funds  with maturities of twenty four months or less 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of debt instruments  interest rate risk is mitigated 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december  or  we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative  foreign currency or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
