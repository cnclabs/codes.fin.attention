additional securities may be of a class preferred to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined by the board 
liquidity 
the company s principal source of short term liquidity is the credit agreement 
there was million of outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement as of december  including million of undrawn and outstanding letters of credit under the credit agreement  the company had billion of unused borrowing capacity as of december  debt ratings 
the company receives debt credit ratings from standard poor s ratings group  inc s p and moody s investor services  inc 
moody s  which are subject to regular reviews 
during  s p lowered the company s corporate credit rating to bb with a stable outlook from bbb 
during  moody s cut the company s corporate credit rating to ba with a negative outlook from baa s p and moody s consider many factors in determining the company s ratings  including production growth opportunities  liquidity  debt levels and asset and reserve mix

book capitalization and current ratio 
the company s book capitalization at december  was billion  consisting of debt of billion and stockholders equity of billion 
consequently  the company s debt to book capitalization decreased to percent at december  from percent at december  the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 
to at december   essentially unchanged from december  critical accounting estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements for inclusion in this report in accordance with gaap 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for a comprehensive discussion of the company s significant accounting policies 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements  the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including  in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
following is a discussion of the company s most critical accounting estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the company s application of gaap 
asset retirement obligations 
the company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities and to restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations 
the company s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligations  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
see notes b and l of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding the company s asset retirement obligations 
successful efforts method of accounting 
the company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities as opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method 
in general  the company believes that  during periods of active exploration  net assets and net income are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method 
the critical difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and the full cost method is as follows under the successful efforts method  exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur  whereas  under the full cost method of accounting  such costs and expenses are capitalized as assets  pooled with the costs of successful wells and charged against the earnings of future periods as a component of depletion expense 
during  and  the company recognized exploration  abandonment  geological and geophysical expense from i continuing operations of million  million and million  respectively  and ii discontinued operations of million  million and million  respectively  under the successful efforts method 
proved reserve estimates 
estimates of the company s proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap and sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of o the quality and quantity of available data  o the interpretation of that data  o the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and o the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the company s proved reserve information included in this report as of december   and was prepared by the company s engineers and audited by independent petroleum engineers with respect to the company s major properties 
estimates prepared by third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from future actual results  reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify  positively or negatively  material revisions to the estimate of proved reserves 
it should not be assumed that the standardized measure included in this report as of december  is the current market value of the company s estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the company based the standardized measure on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
see item a 
risk factors for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves 
the company s estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which the company records depletion expense will increase  reducing future net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
in addition  a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the company s assessment of its proved properties and goodwill for impairment 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
the company reviews its proved properties to be held and used whenever management determines that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable 
management assesses whether or not an impairment provision is necessary based upon its outlook of future commodity prices and net cash flows that may be generated by the properties and if a significant downward revision has occurred to the estimated proved reserves 
proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment at the level at which depletion of proved properties is calculated 
impairment of unproved oil and gas properties 
management periodically assesses unproved oil and gas properties for impairment  on a project by project basis 
management s assessment of the results of exploration activities  commodity price outlooks  planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects impacts the amount and timing of impairment provisions  if any 
suspended wells 
the company suspends the costs of exploratory wells that discover hydrocarbons pending a final determination of the commercial potential of the oil and gas discovery 
the ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity and development decisions 
if the company decides not to pursue additional appraisal activities or development of these fields  the costs of these wells will be charged to exploration and abandonment expense 
the company generally does not carry the costs of drilling an exploratory well as an asset in its consolidated balance sheets for more than one year following the completion of drilling unless the exploratory well finds oil and gas reserves in an area requiring a major capital expenditure and both of the following conditions are met i the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well 
ii the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
due to the capital intensive nature and the geographical location of certain alaskan  deepwater gulf of mexico and foreign projects  it may take the company longer than one year to evaluate the future potential of the exploration well and economics associated with making a determination on its commercial viability 
in these instances  the project s feasibility is not contingent upon price improvements or advances in technology  but rather the company s ongoing efforts and expenditures related to accurately predicting the hydrocarbon recoverability based on well information  gaining access to other companies production  transportation or processing facilities and or getting partner approval to drill additional appraisal wells 
these activities are ongoing and being pursued constantly 
consequently  the company s assessment of suspended exploratory well costs is continuous until a decision can be made that the well has found proved reserves or is noncommercial and is impaired 
see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding the company s suspended exploratory well costs 
assessments of functional currencies 
management determines the functional currencies of the company s subsidiaries based on an assessment of the currency of the economic environment in which a subsidiary primarily realizes and expends its operating revenues  costs and expenses 
the us dollar is the functional currency of all of the company s international operations except canada 
the assessment of functional currencies can have a significant impact on periodic results of operations and financial position 
argentine economic and currency measures 
in april  the company sold its assets in argentina for proceeds of million  resulting in a gain of million 
prior to the divestiture  the accounting for and remeasurement of the company s argentine balance sheets as of december  reflect management s assumptions regarding some uncertainties unique to argentina s economic environment 
the argentine economic and political situation continues to evolve and the argentine government may enact future regulations or policies that  when finalized and adopted  may materially impact  among other items  the timing of repatriations of the sales proceeds and contingent liabilities associated with the company s retained obligations and its indemnifications provided to the purchaser of the assets 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note b of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for a description of the assumptions utilized in the preparation of these financial statements 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
the company continually assesses both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized prior to their expiration 
pioneer monitors company specific  oil and gas industry and worldwide economic factors and reassesses the likelihood that the company s net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes in each jurisdiction will be utilized prior to their expiration 
there can be no assurances that facts and circumstances will not materially change and require the company to establish deferred tax asset valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions in a future period 
as of december   the company does not believe there is sufficient positive evidence to reverse its valuation allowances related to certain foreign tax jurisdictions 
goodwill impairment 
the company reviews its goodwill for impairment at least annually 
this requires the company to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting units that have goodwill 
there is considerable judgment involved in estimating fair values  particularly in the estimation of proved reserves as described above 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information 
litigation and environmental contingencies 
the company makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for ongoing litigation and environmental remediation 
actual costs can vary from such estimates for a variety of reasons 
the costs to settle litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws and opinions and assessments on the amount of damages 
similarly  environmental remediation liabilities are subject to change because of changes in laws and regulations  developing information relating to the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 
under gaap  a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if the company determines the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimable 
see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding the company s commitments and contingencies 
valuations of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans 
the company is the sponsor of certain defined benefit pension and postretirement plans 
in accordance with gaap  the company is required to estimate the present value of its unfunded pension and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations 
based on those values  the company records the unfunded obligations of those plans and records ongoing service costs and associated interest expense 
the valuation of the company s pension and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations requires management assumptions and judgments as to benefit cost inflation factors  mortality rates and discount factors 
changes in these factors may materially change future benefit costs and pension and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations 
see new accounting pronouncements below and note h of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding the company s pension and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations 
valuation of stock based compensation 
the company adopted the modified prospective approach as prescribed under sfas no 
r on january  under this approach  the company is required to expense all options and other stock based compensation that vested during the year of adoption based on the fair value of the award on the grant date 
the calculation of the fair value of stock based compensation requires the use of estimates to derive the various inputs necessary for using the black scholes valuation method elected by the company 
new accounting pronouncements the following discussions provide information about new accounting pronouncements that were issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb during fin in july  the fasb issued interpretation no

under sfas  a business entity that sponsors one or more single employer defined benefit plans is required to o recognize the funded status of a benefit plan in its balance sheet  measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value with limited exceptions and the benefit obligation  o recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period  but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost  o measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position and o disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses  prior service costs or credits  and transition assets or obligations 
an employer with publicly traded securities is required to initially recognize the funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the first fiscal year ending after december  the company has adopted the provisions of sfas effective on december  the company previously recognized the funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans and currently recognizes periodic changes in its defined benefit postretirement plans as components of service costs in the period of change as allowed by sfas consequently  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s liquidity  financial position or future results of operations

qualitative disclosures non derivative financial instruments 
the company is a borrower under fixed rate and variable rate debt instruments that give rise to interest rate risk 
the company s objective in borrowing under fixed or variable rate debt is to satisfy capital requirements while minimizing the company s costs of capital 
see note f of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for a discussion of the company s debt instruments 
derivative financial instruments 
the company utilizes interest rate  foreign exchange rate and commodity price derivative contracts to hedge interest rate  foreign exchange rate and commodity price risks in accordance with policies and guidelines approved by the board 
in accordance with those policies and guidelines  the company s executive management determines the appropriate timing and extent of hedge transactions 
foreign currency  operations and price risk 
international investments represent  and are expected to continue to represent  a significant portion of the company s total assets 
pioneer currently has international operations in africa and canada  which together represented percent of the company s oil and gas revenues 
although pioneer s primary focus is directed toward onshore north american opportunities  pioneer continues to identify and selectively evaluate other international opportunities 
as a result of such foreign operations  pioneer s financial results and international operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in the legal or regulatory environment  weak economic conditions or changes in political or economic climates and other factors 
for example o local political and economic developments could restrict or increase the cost of pioneer s foreign operations  o exchange controls and currency fluctuations could result in financial losses  o royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims could increase costs of pioneer s foreign operations  o expropriation of the company s property could result in loss of revenue  property and equipment  o civil uprising  riots  terrorist attacks and wars could make it impractical to continue operations  resulting in financial losses  o compliance with applicable us law could be in conflict with the company s contractual obligations  the laws of foreign governments or local customs  o import and export regulations and other foreign laws or policies could result in loss of revenues  o repatriation levels for export revenues could restrict the availability of cash to fund operations outside a particular foreign country and o laws and policies of the us affecting foreign trade  taxation and investment could restrict pioneer s ability to fund foreign operations or may make foreign operations more costly 
pioneer does not currently maintain political risk insurance 
pioneer evaluates on a country by country basis whether obtaining political risk coverage is necessary and may add such insurance in the future if the company believes it is prudent to do so 
argentina 
during april  the company sold its argentine assets for net proceeds of million  resulting in a gain of million 
the results of operations from the argentine operations are being presented as discontinued operations 
during the decade of the s  argentina s government pursued free market policies  including the privatization of state owned companies  deregulation of the oil and gas industry  tax reforms to equalize tax rates for domestic and foreign investors  liberalization of import and export laws and the lifting of exchange controls 
the cornerstone of these reforms was the convertibility law that established an exchange rate of one argentine peso to one us dollar 
these policies were successful as evidenced by the elimination of inflation and substantial economic growth during the early to mid s 
however  throughout the decade  the argentine government failed to balance its fiscal budget  repeatedly incurring significant fiscal deficits such that by the end of argentina had accumulated billion of debt 
during  argentina found itself in a critical economic situation with the combination of high levels of external indebtedness  a financial and banking system in crisis  a country risk rating that had reached levels beyond the historical norm  a high level of unemployment and an economic contraction that had lasted four years 
late in  the country was unable to obtain additional funding from the international monetary fund 
economic instability increased  resulting in substantial withdrawals of cash from the argentine banking system over a short period of time 
the government was forced to implement monetary restrictions and placed limitations on the transfer of funds out of the country without the authorization of the central bank of the republic of argentina 
in january  the government defaulted on a significant portion of argentina s billion of debt and the national congress passed emergency law  which  among other things  overturned the long standing  but unsustainable  convertibility plan 
the government adopted a floating rate of exchange in february two specific provisions of the emergency law directly impacted the company 
first  a tax on the value of hydrocarbon exports was established effective march  the second provision was the requirement that domestic commercial transactions  or contracts  for sales in argentina that were previously denominated in us dollars be converted to pesos ie  pesofication at an exchange rate to be negotiated between sellers and buyers 
furthermore  the government placed a price freeze on gas prices at the wellhead 
with the price of gas pesofied and frozen  the us dollar equivalent price of gas in argentina fell in direct proportion to the level of devaluation 
the abandonment of the convertibility plan and the decision to allow the peso to float in international exchange markets resulted in significant devaluation of the peso 
by september   the peso to us dollar exchange rate had increased from to however  since the end of the third quarter of  the peso to us dollar exchange rate had stabilized at approximately as a result of the argentine economic instability and government regulation  the company i received prices for the oil and gas it produced at prices significantly below those received in its other operating areas  ii curtailed the investment the company made in argentina and iii ultimately led the company to dispose of its argentine assets 
the company is currently winding up the affairs associated with its remaining argentine entity 
the company is still exposed to the uncertainties surrounding the argentine economic and political situation until the company completes i the distribution of its remaining sales proceeds to the united states  ii the liquidation of its remaining argentine entity and iii its obligations under the indemnifications and retained obligations related to the divestiture of the argentine assets 
africa 
the company s producing assets in africa are in south africa and tunisia 
the company views the operating environment in these african nations as stable and the economic stability as good 
the company also has an exploration program in the developing west african countries of equatorial guinea and nigeria 
while the values of the various african nations currencies fluctuate in relation to the us dollar  the company believes that any currency risk associated with pioneer s african operations would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations given that such operations are closely tied to oil prices  which are denominated in us dollars 
canada 
the company views the operating environment in canada as stable and the economic stability as good 
a portion of the company s canadian revenues and substantially all of its costs are denominated in canadian dollars 
while the value of the canadian dollar fluctuates in relation to the us dollar  the company believes that any currency risk associated with its canadian operations would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
as of december   the company s primary risk exposures associated with financial instruments to which it is a party include oil and gas price volatility  volatility in the exchange rates of the canadian dollar vis a vis the us dollar and interest rate volatility 
the company s primary risk exposures associated with financial instruments have not changed significantly since december
