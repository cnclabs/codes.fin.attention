item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled risks related to our business and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of recombinant human enzymes for the drug delivery  palliative care  oncology  and infertility markets 
our existing products and our products under development are based on intellectual property covering the family of human enzymes known as hyaluronidases 
hyaluronidases are enzymes proteins that break down hyaluronic acid  which is a naturally occurring substance in the human body 
our technology is based on recombinant human ph rhuph  a human synthetic version of hyaluronidase that degrades hyaluronic acid  a space filling  gel like substance that is a major component of tissues throughout the body  such as skin and cartilage 
the ph enzyme is a naturally occurring enzyme that digests hyaluronic acid to temporarily break down the gel  thereby facilitating the penetration and diffusion of other drugs and fluids that are injected under the skin or in the muscle 
it also degrades the cumulus matrix surrounding oocytes eggs facilitating in vitro fertilization ivf 
currently  we have only limited revenue from cumulase product sales and the sale of the active pharmaceutical ingredient api for hylenex 
all of our potential products  with the exception of cumulase and hylenex  are 
table of contents either in the research  pre clinical  or clinical stage 
it may be years  if ever  before we are able to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to generate meaningful revenue from the sale of these product candidates 
in addition  we have only generated minimal revenue from our biopharmaceutical operations and we have had operating and net losses each year since inception  with an accumulated deficit of  as of december  recent highlights in december  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with roche for enhanze technology 
under the terms of the agreement  roche will obtain a worldwide  exclusive license to develop and commercialize product combinations of rhuph  our proprietary recombinant human hyaluronidase  and up to thirteen roche target compounds resulting from the collaboration 
roche paid us million as an initial upfront payment for the application of rhuph to three pre defined roche biologic targets 
pending the successful completion of a series of clinical  regulatory  and sales events  roche may pay us further milestones which could potentially reach a value of up to million 
in addition  roche may pay us royalties on product sales for these first three targets 
over the next ten years  roche will also have the option to exclusively develop and commercialize rhuph with an additional ten targets to be identified by roche  provided that roche will be obligated to pay continuing exclusivity maintenance fees to us in order to maintain its exclusive development rights for these targets 
for each of the additional ten targets  roche may pay us further upfront and milestone payments of up to million per target as well as royalties on potential product sales for each of these additional ten targets 
additionally  roche will obtain access to our expertise in developing and applying rhuph to roche targets 
in addition  on december   an affiliate of roche purchased  shares of common stock for an aggregate of approximately million  or per share  which represents a premium to the average closing price of our common stock over the days immediately preceding the purchase date 
in february  we amended certain agreements with baxter for hylenex and entered into a new agreement for kits and co formulations with rhuph under the terms of these agreements  baxter paid us an initial upfront payment of million and  pending the successful completion of a series of regulatory and sales events  baxter may make milestone payments which could potentially reach a value of up to million 
in addition  baxter will pay royalties on the sales of products covered under the agreements 
baxter prepaid million of these royalties in connection with the execution of the agreements and baxter will be obligated to prepay million of additional royalties on or prior to january  baxter will also now assume all development  manufacturing  clinical  regulatory  sales and marketing costs of the products covered by the agreements 
we will continue to supply baxter with the active pharmaceutical ingredient  and baxter will fill and finish hylenex and hold it for subsequent distribution 
baxter will obtain a worldwide  exclusive license to develop and commercialize product combinations of rhuph  our proprietary recombinant human hyaluronidase  with baxter hydration fluids and generic small molecule drugs with the exception of combinations with i bisphosphonates  as well as ii cytostatic and cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents  the rights to which have been retained by us 
additionally  baxter will pay royalties on the sales  if any  of the products that result from the collaboration 
in addition  on february   an affiliate of baxter purchased  shares of halozyme s common stock for an aggregate of million  or per share  which represents a premium to the average closing price of our common stock over the days immediately preceding the purchase date 
current products and product candidates we currently have two fda approved products  cumulase and hylenex 
we also have one product candidate  chemophase  which is currently in clinical development 
all of our other product candidates are in the research or pre clinical stage of development 
we received a ce european conformity mark for cumulase in december and fda clearance in april we launched cumulase in the european union and in the united states in june during march  we filed a new drug application nda for the spreading agent hylenex 
other manufacturers have fda approved products for use as spreading agents  including ista pharmaceuticals  inc ista  with an ovine ram hyaluronidase  vitrase  amphastar pharmaceuticals  inc  with a bovine bull hyaluronidase  amphadase tm  and primapharm  inc also with a bovine hyaluronidase  hydase tm 
the fda has 
table of contents determined that amphadase  hydase  hylenex and vitrase are distinct new chemical entities and hence afforded five years of market exclusivity 
the five year market exclusivity precludes identical new chemical entity products from being marketed for a period of five years 
as each of these products is established as distinctly different new chemical entities  the marketing exclusivity granted does not prohibit the marketing of the products 
during december  we received fda approval for our hylenex nda 
during june  we submitted an investigational new drug application ind in order to begin clinical testing of our chemophase product candidate 
we received authorization to initiate clinical testing of chemophase in august  and we commenced patient enrollment in our initial clinical protocol under this ind in october in march  we completed enrollment in our chemophase phase i clinical trial 
in april  we commenced patient enrollment in our chemophase phase i iia clinical trial 
revenues product revenue will depend on our ability to develop  manufacture  obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize our product candidates 
we received a ce european conformity mark for cumulase in december  which allows the company to market cumulase in the european union 
in addition  we received fda clearance for cumulase in april  which allows the company to market cumulase in the united states 
in june  cumulase was launched in the european union and united states 
in december  we received fda approval for hylenex 
revenues from collaborative and licensing agreements are recognized based on the performance requirements of the agreement 
revenue is deferred for fees received before earned 
nonrefundable upfront fees  where we have an ongoing involvement or performance obligation  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the contract or development period 
in december  we entered into the roche agreement which consists of non refundable upfront license fees  reimbursements of research and development services and various performance or sales milestones and future product royalty payments 
due to our ongoing involvement obligation  we recorded the nonrefundable upfront license fee received under the roche agreement as deferred revenue when received in december and will be recognized over the term of the contract 
costs and expenses cost of sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of raw materials  third party manufacturing costs  fill and finish costs  freight associated with the sales of cumulase  and the api for hylenex 
research and development 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the development and manufacturing of our product candidates  compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  supplies and materials  costs for consultants and related contract research  clinical trials  facility costs  amortization and depreciation 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred 
our research and development activities are primarily focused on the development of our chemophase and hylenex product candidates which are both based on our recombinant human ph rhuph enzyme  a human synthetic version of hyaluronidase 
we completed enrollment in our chemophase phase i clinical trial in march and commenced patient enrollment in our chemophase phase i iia clinical trial in april since our inception through december   we have incurred research and development costs of million 
from january  through december   approximately of our research and development costs were associated with the research and development of our recombinant human ph enzyme used in our cumulase and hylenex products and approximately of our research and development costs were associated with the development of our chemophase product candidate 
due to the uncertainty in obtaining fda approval  our reliance on third parties  and competitive pressures  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the additional costs we will incur in the continued development of our hylenex product and our chemophase product candidate for commercialization 
however  we expect our research and development costs to increase substantially if we are able to advance our product candidates into later stages of clinical development 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success  and total costs vary widely 
although we are currently focused primarily on advancing chemophase  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which research 
table of contents and development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical progress of each product candidate and other market and regulatory developments 
product candidate completion dates and costs vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to estimate 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we received fda approval for our hylenex product candidate in december we submitted an ind for our chemophase product candidate in june  and initiated phase i clinical trials in october in march  we completed enrollment in our chemophase phase i clinical trial 
in april  we commenced patient enrollment in our chemophase phase i iia clinical trial 
we cannot be certain when or if our chemophase product candidate  or any of our other product candidates  will receive regulatory approval or whether any net cash inflow from our chemophase product candidate  or any of our other product candidates  or development projects  will commence 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and other expenses related to our corporate operations and administrative employees  accounting and legal fees  other professional services expenses  marketing expenses  as well as other expenses associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
we anticipate continued increases in selling  general and administrative expenses as our research and development activities continue to expand 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
we anticipate increases in other income due to increases in our cash and cash equivalents 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product sales cumulase revenue is recognized when the transfer of ownership occurs  upon shipment to the distributor 
accounts receivable is recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
currently  the allowance for doubtful accounts is zero as the collectibility of accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
we are not obligated to accept returns for products 
thus  no allowance for product returns has been established 
under the terms of our baxter agreement  we will supply baxter the active pharmaceutical ingredient for hylenex at our cost and baxter will fill and finish hylenex and hold it for subsequent distribution 
during the years ended december  and  we transferred  and  respectively  of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for hylenex to baxter for filling and finishing 
because of our continued involvement in the development and production process of hylenex under the terms of the supply agreement  the earnings process is 
table of contents not considered to be complete 
accordingly  we defer revenue and the related product costs resulting from transfers of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for hylenex to baxter until the product is ultimately sold to customers  or otherwise disposed 
revenues under collaborative agreements revenues from collaborative and licensing agreements are recognized based on the performance requirements of the agreement 
revenue is deferred for fees received before earned 
nonrefundable upfront fees  where we have an ongoing involvement or performance obligation  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the contract or development period 
in december  we entered into the roche agreement which consists of non refundable upfront license fees  reimbursements of research and development services and various performance or sales milestones and future product royalty payments 
due to our ongoing involvement obligation  we recorded the nonrefundable upfront license fee received under the roche agreement as deferred revenue when received in december and will be recognized over the term of the contract 
reimbursements of research and development services are recognized as revenues during the period in which the services are performed 
payments related to substantive  performance based milestones in a collaborative agreement are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the milestones as specified in the underlying agreements when they represent the culmination of the earnings process 
royalty revenue from licensed products will be recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the license agreements 
cost of sales cost of sales consists primarily of raw materials  third party manufacturing costs  fill and finish costs  freight associated with the sales of cumulase  and the api for hylenex 
share based compensation expense we grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees  directors and consultants under our stock option plans 
the benefits provided under these plans are share based payments subject to the provisions of revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
 share based payment sfas r 
effective january   we adopted sfas r  including the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab and use the fair value method to account for share based payments with a modified prospective application which provides for certain changes to the method for valuing share based compensation 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified or cancelled 
under the modified prospective application  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
total compensation cost for our share based payments recognized for the year ended december  was million 
selling  general and administrative expense and research and development expense for the year ended december  included share based compensation of  and  respectively 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes merton option pricing model black scholes model that uses assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our common stock and our peer group 
the expected term of options granted is based on analyses of historical employee termination rates and option exercises 
the risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant 
since we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future  we estimated the dividend yield to be 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate pre vesting forfeitures based on our historical experience and those of our peer group 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate 
table of contents share based compensation under sfas r 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with sfas r and the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
clinical trial and contract research expenses research and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred 
our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions  clinical research organizations  and other vendors that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
generally  these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones 
expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol 
if timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed  we modify our estimates accordingly on a prospective basis 
in addition  we have several contracts that extend across multiple reporting periods  including our largest contract representing a  clinical trial 
we recognize expenses as the services are provided pursuant to management s assessment of the progress that has been made to date 
such contracts require an assessment of the work that has been completed during the period  including measurement of progress  analysis of data that justifies the progress and management s judgment 
based on company experience and management s intimate involvement with these outsourced contracts  it is reasonably likely that we may experience a variance in our estimate of the work completed 
a variance in our estimate of the work completed in our largest contract could increase or decrease our operating expenses by  which would not represent a material change to historically reported results of operations 
inventory inventory consists of our cumulase product and our hylenex api 
inventory primarily represents raw materials used in production  work in process  and finished goods inventory on hand  valued at actual cost 
inventories are reviewed periodically for slow moving or obsolete status 
if a launch of a new product is delayed  inventory may not be fully utilized and could be subject to impairment  at which point we would record a reserve to adjust inventory to its net realizable value 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap 
there are also areas in which our management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
please see our audited financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by us gaap 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues product sales were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
cumulase product sales were  and  and sales of the api for hylenex were  and for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents revenues under collaborative agreements increased by  for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  revenues under collaborative agreements primarily consist of the amortization of the upfront fee from roche and research and development payments from baxter 
cost of sales cost of sales were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase was due to the increase in product sales for cumulase and the api for hylenex 
research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our research and development expenses consisted primarily of costs associated with the development and manufacturing of our product candidates  compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  supplies and materials  costs for consultants and related contract research  facility costs  amortization and depreciation 
research and development expenses decreased by million  primarily due to decreased contract manufacturing  analytical  and stability costs related to the development and production of our rhuph enzyme of million and decreased contract research studies of million  primarily due to a chemophase toxicology study of million performed in  and decreased consulting fees of  partially offset by higher clinical trial costs of million  increased compensation costs of  and share based compensation costs of  we expect research and development costs to increase in future periods as we increase our research efforts  expand our clinical trials  and continue to develop and manufacture our product candidates 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million primarily related to increased compensation costs of  share based compensation expenses of  increased recruiting costs of  increased professional fees of  mainly associated with increased legal services related to collaborative agreements and increased audit and consulting fees related to internal controls documentation and testing under the sarbanes oxley act of in addition  marketing costs increased  due primarily to our share of hylenex pre launch marketing expenses 
as a result of our recently amended agreements with baxter  we do not anticipate to incur any additional hylenex marketing expenses 
share based compensation through  we accounted for our stock plans using the intrinsic value method and recorded no stock based compensation for options granted to employees 
effective at the beginning of  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment  and elected to adopt the modified prospective application method 
sfas no 
r requires us to use a fair valued based method to account for share based compensation 
accordingly  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period 
total compensation cost for our share based payments for the year ended december  was million 
selling  general and administrative expense and research and development expense for the year ended december  include share based compensation of  and  respectively 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note  significant accounting policies change in accounting method for share based compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
interest and other income and expense interest and other income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in other income was due to higher interest income as a result of maintaining higher average cash balances during we anticipate increases in other income due to increases in our cash and cash equivalents 
net loss net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per common share  compared to million  or per common share for the year ended december  the increase in net loss was due to an increase in operating expenses 

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and revenues product sales were  for the year ended december  and consisted of sales of cumulase  which we launched in june  compared to for the year ended december  cost of sales cost of sales were  for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  research and development expenses increased by million primarily due to increased contract manufacturing  analytical  and stability costs related to the completion of cumulase k requirements  the completion of hylenex chemistry manufacturing and controls work and the completion of chemophase toxicology work totaling approximately million  the hiring of additional research and development personnel resulting in increased compensation costs of million  increased clinical trial costs of  and increased license fee payments of  selling  general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses increased by  due to the hiring of additional administrative personnel and increased legal fees 
interest and other income and expense interest and other income was  for the year ended december  compared to other expense of  for the year ended december  the increase in other income was due to higher interest income as a result of maintaining higher average cash balances during net loss net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per common share  compared to million  or per common share for the year ended december  the increase in net loss was due to an increase in operating expenses  reflecting our increased research and development efforts and additional personnel costs 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash and cash equivalents were million versus million as of december   an increase of million 
this increase resulted primarily from the million initial up front payment received from roche  million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock to roche  and net proceeds from the exercise of warrants and stock options of million during the year ended december   offset by our net cash used in operations and for the purchase of property and equipment for the year ended december  operating activities net cash provided by operations was million during the year ended december  compared to million of cash used in operations during the year ended december  this change was due to the million initial up front payment received from roche in of which million was recorded as deferred revenue 
net cash used in operations was million during the year ended december  compared to million of cash used in operations during the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase in our research and development efforts and additional personnel 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  during the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  this was due to the increased purchase of property and equipment during 
table of contents net cash used in investing activities was  during the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  this was due to the increased purchase of property and equipment during financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december  versus million during the year ended december  in december  we sold common stock for approximately million  net of issuance costs 
additionally  we received approximately million in net proceeds from warrant and stock option exercises during the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december  versus million during the year ended december  in december  we received proceeds from the sale of common stock for million  net of issuance costs 
additionally  we received  in proceeds from warrant and stock option exercises during the year ended december  in january  we sold common stock and warrants to purchase common stock for million  net of issuance costs 
in october  we sold common stock and warrants to purchase common stock for million  net of issuance costs 
additionally  we received million in proceeds from warrant exercises during the year ended december  we expect our cash requirements to increase significantly as we continue to increase our research and development for  seek regulatory approvals of  and develop and manufacture our current product candidates 
as we expand our research and development efforts and pursue additional product opportunities  we anticipate significant cash requirements for hiring of personnel  capital expenditures and investment in additional internal systems and infrastructure 
the amount and timing of cash requirements will depend on the research  development  manufacture  regulatory and market acceptance of our product candidates  if any  and the resources we devote to researching  developing  manufacturing  commercializing and supporting our product candidates 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds from our recent roche and baxter collaborations 
we may finance future cash needs through the sale of other equity securities  the exercise of our callable warrants  strategic collaboration agreements  debt financing  or any combination of the foregoing 
on june   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s registration no 
 which was declared effective on june   which will permit us  from time to time  to offer and sell up to million of equity or debt securities 
we currently have the ability to issue debt and equity securities for an aggregate of million under our shelf registration statement 
we cannot be certain that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs or delay the launch of our product candidates 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december   future minimum payments due under our contractual obligations are as follows payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases license payments purchase obligations total as of december   we had no long term debt or capital lease obligations 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors may include  but are not limited to  the following the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities  the number and scope of our research activities  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  our ability to establish and maintain product discovery and development collaborations  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  and the extent to which we acquire or in license new products  technologies or businesses

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we intend to continue to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   we did not have any holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments  or any foreign currency denominated transactions  and all of our cash and cash equivalents were in money market funds and other highly liquid investments
