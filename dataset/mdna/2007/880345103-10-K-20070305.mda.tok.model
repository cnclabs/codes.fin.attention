item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview tennant company is a world leader in designing  manufacturing and marketing of solutions that help create a cleaner  safer world 
we provide equipment  parts and consumables and specialty surface coatings to contract cleaners  end user businesses  healthcare facilities  schools and local  state and federal governments 
we sell our products through our direct sales and service organization and a network of authorized distributors worldwide 
geographically  our customers are primarily located in north america  europe and other international markets including the middle east  asia  japan  latin america and australia 
we strive to be an innovator in our industry through our commitment to understanding our customers needs and using our expertise to create innovative solutions 
on april   the board of directors declared a two for one common stock split effective july  as a result of the stock split  shareholders of record received one additional common share for every share held at the close of business on july  share and per share data in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split 
in  tennant built on its strong performance with record net sales of million and a increase in diluted net earnings per share to 
current year growth in net sales of was complemented by a year over year improvement of in operating profit to million 
our results included million in costs to support our strategic initiatives and million in stock option expense resulting from the required adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r share based payment revised sfas no 
r 
price increases taken earlier in the year and manufacturing cost reduction actions were not enough to offset rising material costs  resulting in a decline in gross profit margins of percentage points to 
despite these increased costs  we were able to leverage our growth in net sales into improved profitability through operating efficiencies and cost controls within selling and administrative expenses 
a decrease in the effective tax rate of percentage points  primarily due to a one time tax benefit  as well as an increase in interest and esop income also contributed to the improved profitability 
tennant s financial position remains strong  enabling continued investment in innovative product development and global expansion 
we ended with a debt to capital ratio of and million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we generated operating cash flows of million during shareholders equity increased by to million  as compared to in the fourth quarter of  as required  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
the new standard requires the net funded position of the our retirement benefit plans to be recognized as an asset or liability on our balance sheet 
the net effect of adopting this new standard was an increase to shareholders equity of million 
during  we incurred approximately million in support of our previously disclosed china expansion and global manufacturing footprint consolidation initiatives 
we manufactured our first product in our china facility during the third quarter of and have been successful at building our distributor base in china during the year 
our manufacturing footprint consolidation initiative was in its early phases during and is expected to be completed during we expect to incur approximately million to million in costs associated with completing these initiatives during through these initiatives and by establishing asia as a key source for parts and components  we expect to broaden our global sourcing capabilities  reduce product costs and improve operating efficiencies over the next three to five years 
in connection with our manufacturing footprint consolidation  we anticipate selling our maple grove  minnesota facility near the end of while we cannot estimate the impact of selling this facility because of the uncertainty of the transaction price and timing  we anticipate a substantial gain on the sale 
during  we decided to stop production of our centurion chassis mounted street sweeper once our remaining chassis commitment with a third party manufacturer had been utilized 
by the end of the year  we had produced and sold all of our remaining centurions 
during  the centurion contributed approximately million to net sales 
we discontinued this product in order to devote tennant s resources to stronger growth opportunities in other areas of the business 
during  we launched six new products which targeted all markets as part of our efforts to grow through innovation 
a similar level of new product launches are planned for sales of new products introduced in the past three years generated almost of our total growth in net sales during we also grew our revenue base during through expanded market coverage in europe with the acquisition of hofmans machinefabriek hofmans in july hofmans  a manufacturer of outdoor cleaning equipment based in schaijk  the netherlands  complements our current suite of products in the european market and adds approximately million in annual revenue to our european operations 
the acquisition is further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the operations of hofmans have been included in our results of operations since july   the date of acquisition 
we believe we can continue to grow our revenue through both innovation and expanded market coverage in and beyond 
these initiatives also support our efforts to meet the business challenges we face 
current challenges facing tennant include successful mitigation of continued cost increases for raw materials and other purchased components  due to rising commodity costs  through price increases and cost reduction actions 
we expect to see a continued upward trend in commodity prices driving increases in our cost of commodity based products in the relative strength or weakness of the global economies in may also impact demand for our products and services in the markets we serve 
despite general improvements in macro economic indicators for our industry in  the global economy remains unpredictable and somewhat volatile 
lastly  our results continue to be impacted by changes in value of the us dollar primarily against the euro  the australian and canadian dollars  the british pound  the japanese yen and the chinese yuan 
to the extent the applicable exchange rates weaken relative to the us dollar  the related direct foreign currency exchange effect would have an unfavorable impact on our results 
if the applicable exchange rates strengthen relative to the us dollar  our results would be favorably impacted

we use economic profit as a key indicator of financial performance and the primary metric for performance based incentives 
economic profit is based on our net operating profit after taxes less a charge for the net assets used in the business 
the key drivers of net operating profit we focus on include net sales  gross margin and operating expenses 
the key drivers we focus on to measure how effectively we utilize net assets in the business include accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso  days inventory on hand dioh and capital expenditures 
these key drivers are discussed in greater depth throughout management s discussion and analysis 
net sales in  consolidated net sales of million increased from consolidated net sales of million in increased from in  growth was driven by increases in all geographic regions and all product categories 
growth in equipment sales was attributable to volume growth and price increases 
equipment volume increases were driven by new product sales  organic growth in europe and the acquisition of hofmans 
organic volume growth in service  parts and consumables also contributed to the overall increase in net sales

table of contents european net sales in increased to million compared to this increase was driven by growth in service  parts and consumables and equipment sales 
increases in service  parts and consumables were primarily due to expanded market coverage  while increases in equipment sales were driven by volume increases resulting from new products  price increases and expanded market coverage 
in addition  the shipment of a large order to a new customer in the fourth quarter of contributed about to europe s net sales similar to the large order which occurred in the first quarter of positive direct foreign currency exchange effects increased european net sales by approximately in other international other international net sales in increased to million over net sales of million

negative direct foreign currency exchange effects decreased net sales in other international markets by approximately in other international net sales for increased to million compared to overall growth in net sales was primarily driven by volume growth due to new products as well as stronger sales in certain markets resulting from strengthening economies 
positive direct foreign currency exchange effects increased net sales in other international markets by approximately in gross profit gross profit margin was in  declining percentage points from in price increases taken earlier in the year and manufacturing cost reduction actions were not enough to offset higher material costs and expenses associated with the startup of our china facility and our manufacturing footprint consolidation 
gross profit margin improved percentage points to in compared to gross profit margin in was favorably impacted by operating efficiencies including cost reduction actions taken in  improved overhead absorption  and decreased net logistics costs as well as favorable foreign currency exchange 
also contributing to gross margin improvement was a favorable sales mix of products sold  including a higher percentage of direct sales which have higher gross margins 
in addition  price increases implemented in the latter part of and early in neutralized the impact of higher steel costs that had adversely affected gross margins 
future gross profit margins could continue to be impacted by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials and other product components  competitive market conditions  the mix of products both within and among product lines and geographies  and foreign currency exchange effects 
operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or in compared to  and increased to as a percentage of net sales in research and development expenses increased million  or in compared to  and increased to as a percentage of net sales in the increased research and development spending in related primarily to investments in new product development for manufacture in our china facility and new product launches in and we strive to be the industry leader in innovation and are committed to investing in research and development 
we expect to maintain our spending on research and development at approximately of net sales annually in support of this commitment 
selling and administrative expenses s a expenses increased by million  or  in compared to s a expenses increased in part due to general inflationary cost increases including salaries wages  medical  travel and fuel costs 
increases in sales incentives and warranty expenses driven primarily by growth in net sales and higher levels of marketing expenses for new product launches also contributed to the increase in s a expenses over the prior year 
additional costs due to the inclusion of expenses related to the acquired operations of hofmans  costs to support expansion in china and international growth initiatives further increased our s a expenses in comparison to lastly  s a expenses include the impact of recognizing stock option expense associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r 
as a percentage of net sales  s a expenses declined percentage point to  as growth in net sales outpaced these cost increases 
during the first quarter of  we adopted sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires that compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions  including employee stock options  be recognized in the financial statements 
we applied the modified prospective approach to transition in our adoption of this standard 
compensation cost related to the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the adoption date is based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated under the original provisions of sfas no 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  s a expenses for included million million after tax or per diluted share of expense related to stock options 
s a expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in s a expenses was primarily due to an increase in performance based incentive compensation expense  including additional expense resulting from modifications to our management compensation program which discontinued annual employee stock option grants 
our modified program is primarily comprised of performance based shares that are expensed over the performance period instead of stock option grants  for which there was no expense prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
s a expense also increased in due to expanded sales and service market coverage  primarily in europe  an increase in bad debt expense reflecting increased collection risk for certain customers  senior management transition costs  higher fuel costs for sales and service fleet vehicles and sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
s a expenses as a percentage of net sales increased percentage points to as we were unable to fully leverage our increase in net sales against these higher costs 
interest income  net interest income  net was million in  an increase of million from the increase was primarily a result of higher interest rates and average levels of cash and cash equivalents invested 
in addition  short term investments purchased during increased our level of interest earned 
interest income  net was million in  an increase of million from lower interest expense in due to a reduction in debt outstanding and an increase in interest income on higher average cash balances drove the net change between periods 
other expense income  net the million change in other expense income  net between and was primarily due to contributions made to the tennant foundation during that have not been repeated in  increased esop income due to a higher average stock price in than and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the change in other expense income  net between and was primarily due to the discretionary contribution of million to the tennant foundation during 
table of contents income taxes our effective income tax rate was  and for the years  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was substantially related to a refund from a state tax protective claim and the release of tax reserves accrued in prior years 
in  the effective rate was favorably impacted by the resolution of certain outstanding federal  state and foreign tax matters 
during each of the past three years  we had a favorable impact from the extraterritorial income exclusion act eti act  a us tax law  of approximately on our effective tax rate 
on october   the american jobs creation act of was signed into law  which phased out the eti act tax benefit during and in addition  the new law established a manufacturing deduction for profits on us manufactured product to be phased in through for  the phase out of the eti act tax benefit was substantially offset by the phase in of the us manufacturing deduction 
for  we expect the change in the us tax law will have less than one percentage point negative impact on our effective tax rate since the eti is phased out more quickly than the phase in of the us manufacturing deduction 
the american jobs creation act of also had a provision to allow companies to repatriate earnings from their foreign subsidiaries at a favorable tax rate 
we did not repatriate any earnings under the act and we do not plan to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries in the foreseeable future 
we expect our effective tax rate in to be approximately 
this rate may vary based on changes in mix of taxable earnings by country and on our ability to utilize the available foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources during  our financial condition remained strong 
our debt to capital ratio was at december   compared with at december  at december   our capital structure was comprised of million of current debt  million of long term debt and million of shareholders equity 
as of december   we had available committed and uncommitted lines of credit totaling approximately million  with terms generally one year or less  and a million letter of credit outstanding 
we also have a stand alone letter of credit of approximately million outstanding as of december  at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december   up from million as of december  cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled million at december  wherever possible  cash management is centralized and intercompany financing is used to provide working capital to subsidiaries as needed 
our current ratio was at december   and at december   based on working capital of million and million  respectively 
if the global economy deteriorates  it could have an unfavorable impact on the demand for our products and  as a result  our operating cash flow 
we believe that the combination of internally generated funds  present capital resources and available financing sources are more than sufficient to meet cash requirements for our contractual cash obligations and commitments at december   are summarized in the following table in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years on balance sheet obligations collateralized borrowings capital leases    interest payments on capital leases residual value guarantee retirement benefit plans   deferred compensation arrangements     other long term employee benefits total on balance sheet obligations     off balance sheet arrangements operating leases     purchase obligations    total off balance sheet obligations     total contractual obligations     collateralized borrowings on our balance sheet totalling million represent deferred sales proceeds on certain leasing transactions in europe accounted for as borrowings under sfas no 
 accounting for leases sfas no 

we do not expect to have to fund these obligations  as a result  these obligations are not included in the contractual cash obligations and commitments table 
certain operating leases for vehicles contain residual value guarantee provisions  which would become due at the expiration of the operating lease agreement if the fair value of the leased vehicles is less than the guaranteed residual value 
of those leases that contain residual value guarantees  the aggregate residual value at lease expiration is million  of which we have guaranteed million 
as of december   we have recorded a liability for the fair value of this residual value guarantee of million 

table of contents our retirement benefit plans  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  require us to make contributions to the plans from time to time 
our plan obligations totaled million as of december  contributions to the various plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the market performance of plan assets  if any  and future changes in interest rates  which impact the actuarial measurement of plan obligations 
as a result  we have only included our million of expected contributions in the contractual cash obligations and commitments table 
the unfunded deferred compensation arrangements covering certain current and retired management employees totaled million as of december  our estimated distributions in the contractual cash obligations and commitments table are based upon a number of assumptions including termination dates and participant distribution elections 
other long term employee benefit arrangements are comprised of long term incentive compensation arrangements with certain key management  foreign defined contribution plans and other long term arrangements totaling million 
we cannot predict the timing or amount of our future payments associated with these arrangements  as a result  these obligations are not included in the contractual cash obligations and commitments table 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of operating lease commitments for office and warehouse facilities  vehicles and office equipment as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements as well as unconditional purchase commitments 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  these obligations are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
we have a cancellation clause with our third party logistics provider which would require payment of a cancellation fee in the event we elect to cancel the agreement prior to the contract expiration date 
this fee  which approximated million at december   declines on a straight line basis through december in addition  in the event that we elect to cancel the agreement  we would be required to assume the underlying building lease for the remainder of its term 
we have applied the provisions of eitf  determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  and have determined that our agreement with our third party logistics provider contains an operating lease under sfas no 
as a result  we have included the future minimum lease payments related to the underlying building lease in our operating lease commitments in the contractual cash obligations and commitments table 
unconditional purchase obligations include purchase orders entered into in the ordinary course of business and contractual purchase commitments 
during july  we amended our purchase commitment with a third party manufacturer to extend the terms of the agreement to september the remaining commitment under this agreement totaled million as of december  this purchase commitment has been included in the contractual cash obligations and commitments table along with purchase orders entered into in the ordinary course of business 
cash requirements operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in the cash provided by operating activities in was impacted by strong net earnings and an increase in non cash share based compensation expense  an increase in accounts payable  employee compensation and benefits and other accrued expenses 
the increase in share based compensation expense was primarily attributable to the inclusion of stock option expense under sfas no 
r in and an increase in expense associated with performance share and restricted stock awards 
the increases in accounts payable  employee compensation and benefits and other accrued expenses were attributable to higher accruals for volume based incentives and warranty  an increase in payroll accruals as well as timing of payments 
partially offsetting these sources of cash were an increase in receivables driven by higher fourth quarter sales volumes and an increase in inventory 
the increase in inventory was in support of new product launches and the addition of our manufacturing facility in china 
cash flow from operations declined million in compared to this decrease was primarily driven by an increase in inventory  payments of prior year annual performance based incentive accruals and an increase in estimated tax payments during in  cash provided from operating activities was impacted by strong net earnings and an increase in accounts payable  employee compensation and benefits and other accrued expenses 
the increases in accounts payable  employee compensation and benefits and other accrued expenses were attributable to higher accruals for annual performance based incentive payments and timing of payments 
partially offsetting these sources of cash were an increase in receivables and a decrease in other current noncurrent assets and liabilities 
the increase in receivables was driven by higher fourth quarter sales volumes while the decrease in other current noncurrent assets and liabilities was primarily due to a large  lump sum payment of deferred compensation in as discussed previously  two metrics used by management to evaluate how effectively we utilize our net assets are accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso and days inventory on hand dioh  on a fifo basis 
these metrics for the years indicated were as follows in days dioh dso dioh remained at days in compared to as inventory grew at the same pace as demand during the year 
the improvement in dioh of days in reflects a continued focus on inventory reduction initiatives and the introduction of lean manufacturing principles 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in cash used in investing activities in was driven by capital expenditures  purchases of short term investments and the acquisition of hofmans 
cash used in investing activities in was driven by capital expenditures  partially offset by proceeds from disposition of property  plant and equipment and sales of short term investments 
capital expenditures were million during compared to million in capital expenditures were million in capital expenditures in included continued expansion of our information systems capabilities and investments in new product tooling as well as capital spending in support of our china expansion initiative 
capital expenditures in included investments in new product tooling and expansion of our information system capabilities 
capital expenditures in included the installation of a new powder paint system and the purchase of additional system components to provide a platform to expand the capabilities of our information systems 
in  capital expenditures are expected to approximate to million 
significant capital projects planned for include continued investments in our footprint consolidation initiative  new product tooling and capital spending related to our global expansion initiatives 
capital expenditures in are expected to be financed primarily with funds from operations 
proceeds from dispositions of property  plant and equipment in include million in proceeds from the sale of a distribution center in holland  michigan 

table of contents in july  we acquired hofmans for a purchase price of million  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
the cost of the acquisition was paid for in cash with funds provided by operations 
in january  we acquired all of the stock of walter broadley for million in the form of cash and debt as well as assuming million in outstanding debt  of which million was immediately retired 
the cost of the acquisition was paid for in cash with funds provided by operations 
subsequent to december   we acquired floorep limited  which is a distributor of cleaning equipment based in scotland for million in cash 
financing activities net cash used by financing activities was million in  million in and million in in  significant uses of cash included million of dividends paid and million in repurchases of common stock related to our share repurchase program 
in  significant uses of cash included million in dividends paid  a million scheduled debt repayment and million in repurchases of common stock related to our share repurchase program 
proceeds from issuance of common stock were million in and million in proceeds in both years were driven by an increase in employees stock option exercises due to a higher average stock price and senior management transitions 
cash dividends increased for the th consecutive year to per share in  an increase of per share over in november  an additional  shares were authorized under the share repurchase program approved by the board of directors in may in august  the board of directors approved the adjustment of the number of shares then available for repurchase to reflect the impact of the two for one stock split  which increased the number of shares available for repurchase from approximately  immediately before the stock split to approximately  repurchases made in prior to the stock split on july  totaled approximately  shares at an average repurchase price of or  shares at  post split 
following the stock split  approximately  shares were repurchased at an average price of

new accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb released eitf issue no 
 how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement  eitf issue no 

eitf issue no 
concluded that the presentation of sales  use  value added and certain excise taxes on either a gross included in revenues and costs or a net excluded from revenues basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed in the financial statements 
in addition  for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis  a company should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented if those amounts are significant 
eitf issue no 
is effective for periods beginning after december  our accounting policy is to present these on a net basis 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin no 

fin no 
clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe the adoption of fin no 
will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
the requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record a reserve for accounts receivable that are potentially uncollectible 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
in order to assess the collectibility of these receivables  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
our reserves are also based on amounts determined by using percentages applied to trade receivables 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  current economic trends  historical payment and bad debt write off experience 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers and if circumstances related to these customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if more allowances are provided than are ultimately required  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on the actual collection experience 
bad debt write offs as a percentage of net sales were in  in and in as of december   we had million reserved against our accounts receivable for doubtful accounts 
inventory reserves we value our inventory at the lower of the cost of inventory or fair market value through the establishment of a reserve for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with inventory levels 
reserve requirements are developed by comparing our inventory levels to our projected demand requirements based on historical demand  market conditions and technological and product life cycle changes 
it is possible that an increase in our reserve may be required in the future if there is a significant decline in demand for certain products 
this reserve creates a new cost basis for these products and is considered permanent 

table of contents we also record a reserve for inventory shrinkage 
our inventory shrinkage reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses that are recorded and adjusted as a part of our cycle counting and physical inventory procedures 
the reserve amount is based on historical loss trends  historical physical and cycle count adjustments as well as inventory levels 
changes in the reserve result from the completed cycle counts and physical inventories 
as of december   we had million reserved against inventories 
warranty reserves we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio of claims to net sales  the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim  new product introductions and other factors 
future claims experience could be materially different from prior results because of the introduction of new  more complex products  a change in our warranty policy in response to industry trends  competition or other external forces  or manufacturing changes that could impact product quality 
in the event we determine that our current or future product repair and replacement costs exceed our estimates  an adjustment to these reserves would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
warranty expense as a percentage of net sales was in  in and in as of december   we had million reserved for future estimated warranty costs 
income taxes when preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions 
we also establish reserves for income tax contingencies for certain tax matters that are complex in nature and uncertain as to the ultimate outcome 
although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we consider the likelihood of these matters being challenged by tax authorities and our ability to ultimately prevail in defending these matters when establishing these reserves 
we adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit 
we believe that our current reserves are adequate and reflect the most probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
however  the ultimate outcome may differ from our estimates and assumptions and could impact the income tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax returns  and some differences will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on property  plant and equipment 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years but have already been recorded as an expense in our consolidated statements of earnings 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  based on management s judgment  to the extent we believe that recovery is less likely than not  we establish a valuation reserve against those deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax asset valuation allowance could be materially different from actual results because of changes in the mix of future taxable income  the relationship between book and taxable income and our tax planning strategies 
as of december   a valuation allowance of million was recorded against foreign tax loss carryforwards

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to exposures resulting from foreign currency exchange fluctuations in the normal course of business 
our primary exchange rate exposures are with the euro  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar  the british pound  the chinese yuan and the japanese yen against the us dollar 
the direct financial impact of foreign currency exchange includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies to us dollars  the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between tennant operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses 
in addition to the direct financial impact  foreign currency exchange has an indirect financial impact on our results  including the effect on sales volumes within local economies and the impact of pricing actions taken as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
because our products are currently manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states  a stronger dollar generally has a negative impact on results from operations outside the united states while a weaker dollar generally has a positive effect 
our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize the earnings effects associated with foreign exchange rate changes on certain of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
we periodically enter into various contracts  principally forward exchange contracts  to protect the value of certain of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
the gains and losses on these contracts generally approximate changes in the value of the related assets and liabilities 
we had forward exchange contracts outstanding in the notional amounts of approximately million and million at the end of and  respectively 
the potential for material loss in fair value of foreign currency contracts outstanding and the related underlying exposures as of december   from a adverse change is unlikely due to the short term nature of our forward contracts 
our policy prohibits us from entering into transactions for speculative purposes 
commodity risk we are subject to exposures resulting from potential cost increases related to our purchase of raw materials or other product components 
we do not use derivative commodity instruments to manage our exposures to changes in commodity prices such as steel or oil and gas 
various factors beyond our control affect the price of oil and gas  including but not limited to worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and gas  political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions  the price and level of foreign imports  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  domestic and foreign governmental regulation  weather related factors and the overall economic environment 
we purchase petroleum related component parts for use in our manufacturing operations 
in addition  our freight costs associated with shipping and receiving product and sales and service vehicle fuel costs are impacted by fluctuations in the cost of oil and gas 
increases in worldwide demand and other factors affect the price for steel and related products 
we do not maintain an inventory of raw or fabricated steel in excess of near term production requirements 
as a result  increases in the price of steel can significantly increase the cost of our steel based raw materials and component parts if we are not able to fully mitigate with price increases or cost reduction actions 
during  our purchased material and other costs were unfavorably impacted by commodity prices and we were not able to fully mitigate these higher costs with selling price increases and cost reduction actions 
we will continue to focus on mitigating the risk of continued future raw material or other product component increases through product pricing  negotiations with our vendors and cost reduction actions 
the success of these efforts will depend upon our ability to increase our selling prices in a competitive market and our ability to achieve cost savings 
if the commodity prices remain at their current levels or continue to increase  our results may be unfavorably impacted in other matters management regularly reviews our business operations with the objective of improving financial performance and maximizing our return on investment 
as a result of this ongoing process to improve financial performance  we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future which  if taken  could be material to our financial results
