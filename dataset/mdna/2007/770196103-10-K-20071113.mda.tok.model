item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered  application critical equipment and systems for the energy  industrial  chemical and pharmaceutical markets worldwide 
we attribute our success to our close and continuing interaction with customers  our manufacturing  sourcing and application engineering expertise and our ability to serve customers globally 
our business consists of three market focused segments fluid management  process solutions and romaco 
beginning with the first quarter of fiscal  we reported realigned segments 
the new segment structure resulted from a significant reorganization of management  operations and reporting that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal the fluid management segment is comprised of the r m energy systems  moyno and tarby product lines 
the process solutions segment is comprised of the pfaudler  tycon technoglass  chemineer and edlon product lines 
the romaco segment includes the frymakoruma  noack  siebler  macofar  promatic  unipac  and bosspak product lines 
in certain periods the romaco segment includes results from the hapa  laetus  ipm  and zanchetta product lines  which were disposed in march  march  december and february  respectively 
as a result of the segment realignment  the goodwill recorded as of august  was allocated to the company s reporting units based on their relative fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in the first quarter of fiscal  management estimated the fair value of the romaco segment using current prices that the company may receive in the potential disposition of all or parts of romaco and recorded a million goodwill impairment charge 
a formal appraisal was completed in the third quarter of fiscal  resulting in an additional million charge 
unless otherwise noted  the costs mentioned below in this overview were included on the other expense line of our consolidated statement of operations in the period indicated 
during fiscal years  and  we incurred costs related to a restructuring program announced in fiscal the restructuring plan was initiated to improve the profitability of our romaco and process solutions segments and included plant closures  sales of excess facilities  personnel reductions  product line sales  and other activities 
we recorded restructuring costs in fiscal totaling million in the process solutions segment and million in the romaco segment 
the costs in fiscal included million to write down inventory and million to write off intangibles related to discontinued product lines 
the inventory charge is included in cost of sales 
during that year  we sold a romaco facility and a process solutions facility  as well as a process solutions product line 
cash proceeds from these asset sales totaled million 
the net loss recognized in as a result of these asset sales was million 
we recorded restructuring costs in fiscal totaling million in the process solutions segment and million in the romaco segment 
the costs in fiscal included million to write down inventory related to discontinued product lines  which is included in cost of sales

excluding sales from product lines sold in fiscal and  sales increased by approximately million 
exchange rates accounted for million of the increase in sales 
the fluid management segment had sales of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the sales increase is from strong demand for oilfield equipment products due to high levels of oil and gas exploration and recovery activity  as well as improved demand in chemical processing and general industrial markets 
the process solutions segment had sales of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase million  or 
the increase in sales is largely attributable to improved orders for original equipment over the last twelve to eighteen months 
exchange rates contributed million to the increase in sales 
primary end markets  chemical processing and pharmaceutical  continued to improve 
the segment is also benefiting from emerging applications  such as flue gas desulfurization and bio diesel 
the romaco segment had sales of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal excluding product lines sold in fiscal and  sales increased million  or 
current year sales include million of exchange rate benefit 
our orders and backlog improved all year as the pharmaceutical market strengthened over the last twelve to eighteen months  which has translated into higher sales in this segment 

table of contents earnings before interest and income taxes ebit the company s operating performance is evaluated using several measures including ebit 
ebit is income before interest and income taxes and is reconciled to net income on our consolidated statement of operations 
we evaluate performance of our business segments and allocate resources based on ebit 
ebit is not  however  a measure of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and should not be considered as an alternative to net income when evaluating our operating results 
ebit is not a measure of cash available for use by management 
consolidated ebit for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million 
the million fiscal goodwill impairment change and the change in other income expense accounted for million of the increase in ebit 
fiscal results included other income of million  which consisted of net gains on product line and facility sales of million  reduced by restructuring costs in the romaco segment of million 
fiscal results included other income of million  which consisted of net gains on product line and facility sales of million  reduced by restructuring costs in the process solutions and romaco segments of million 
the remaining increase in consolidated ebit of million resulted from the improved profitability after the aforementioned other income and goodwill impairment within each of our operating segments  and lower corporate costs 
the fluid management segment ebit for fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal the increase of million resulted from the sales increase of million 
the process solutions segment ebit was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million 
process solutions had a gain on the sale of a facility of million in fiscal in fiscal process solutions had net other expense of million  consisting of restructuring costs of million  offset by a gain on the sale of a facility of million 
after the previously mentioned change in other expense  ebit increased by million 
approximately million of the increase is attributable to higher sales and the remainder due to cost savings from recent restructuring activities 
the romaco segment ebit was million for fiscal  an increase of million compared to fiscal the change in goodwill impairment charge and other income expense accounted for million of the increase in ebit 
in fiscal  other expense was million and consisted of restructuring costs of million reduced by net gains on product line and facility sales of million  compared with a combined goodwill impairment charge and net other expense including a gain on the sale of product lines and restructuring costs of million in the prior year period 
the remaining million increase in ebit was attributable to higher sales  which contributed million in ebit improvement  and cost savings from restructuring activities 

table of contents interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the reduction in interest expense resulted from lower average debt levels in fiscal compared to fiscal the lower debt levels were attributable to cash generated from operations  asset product line sales and the conversion of million of our convertible notes into common stock late in the fiscal year income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal was 
the effective tax rate is higher than the statutory rate primarily due to certain foreign losses for which no benefit is realized  revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to current rates and increased provisions for tax contingencies 
in we had million of income tax expense in spite of a million pretax loss because of two significant transactions with minimal tax impact  the goodwill impairment charge of million and the gain on the sale of hapa and laetus of million 
after considering the impact of these transactions  our effective tax rate in fiscal was 
the fiscal effective rate was lower than the fiscal adjusted effective rate of because of profitability in jurisdictions  such as germany and italy  where we previously had losses 
net income our net income in fiscal was million compared with a net loss in fiscal of million 
the increase in net income is a result of improved operating performance  lower goodwill impairment and other expenses  lower interest expense and a lower normalized tax rate  as discussed above 

table of contents fiscal year ended august  compared with fiscal year ended august  net sales sales for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
the impact of exchange rates was minimal for the year 
we disposed of several product lines impacting the comparability of our sales 
as of august  the edlon lined pipe and fitting product line of the process solutions segment was sold and as of march  the hapa and laetus product lines of the romaco segment were sold 
these dispositions reduced sales million in fiscal as compared to fiscal continuing business sales increased million or 
the fluid management segment had sales of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase was driven primarily by strong demand for drilling and production equipment  resulting from high oil and natural gas prices 
the segment also enjoyed increases in sales for general industrial and chemical processing applications as a result of healthy end market conditions 
the process solutions segment had sales of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal continuing business sales increased million  or 
chemical processing and pharmaceutical market conditions remained flat for much of the year  however  the company experienced a significant increase in orders during the second half of the year 
the romaco segment had sales of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal continuing business sales increased million  or 
sales in this segment have stabilized at or near historically low levels 
consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry as well as the introduction of fewer new drug compounds led to a decline in the investment in new packaging capacity in this sector  which negatively impacted our sales 
earnings before interest and income taxes ebit consolidated ebit for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  a decline of million 
the decline in ebit was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of million  ebit associated with disposed product lines during the year estimated at approximately million and higher costs related to variable pay  sarbanes oxley compliance and the expensing of stock options under sfas r 
offsetting these ebit declines were lower other costs related to restructuring and facility dispositions of million  the estimated incremental profit from the sales increase of continuing businesses estimated at approximately million and estimated cost savings from restructuring activities of approximately million 
the fluid management segment ebit for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the increase of million resulted from the sales increase of million 
the process solutions segment ebit was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million 
other costs related to restructuring and facility dispositions  discussed above  were million lower in fiscal the remaining improvement in profitability was primarily due to estimated cost savings realized from our restructuring programs and the impact of product mix 
the romaco segment ebit was negative million for fiscal compared to negative million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
the decline in ebit was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of million in fiscal and the ebit associated with disposed product lines during the year estimated at approximately million 
offsetting these ebit declines were lower other costs related to restructuring and facility dispositions in fiscal of million 
the remaining improvement is primarily from estimated cost savings from restructuring programs 

table of contents interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash generated from operations  asset product line sales and the conversion of million of our convertible notes into common stock late in the fiscal year all contributed to lower debt levels in fiscal income taxes we had million of income tax expense in spite of a million pretax loss because of two significant transactions with minimal tax impact  the goodwill impairment charge of million and the gain on the sale of hapa and laetus of million 
after considering the impact of these transactions  our effective tax rate in fiscal was compared with in fiscal these high effective tax rates were the result of our inability to record tax benefits on losses incurred in certain non us tax jurisdictions  primarily germany and italy  due to uncertainty over our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions to utilize these benefits 
the fiscal adjusted rate of is lower than the fiscal rate because of lower losses in germany and italy in fiscal net loss our net loss in fiscal was million compared with a net loss in fiscal of million 
the overall reduction in net income is a result of the fiscal goodwill impairment and the change in other expenses of million  as discussed above  and higher tax expense 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources operating activities in fiscal  our cash flow from operating activities was million compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million 
this increase resulted primarily from higher net income  adjusted for the noncash goodwill impairment in the prior fiscal year of million  reduced by cash used in other operating activities 
we expect our fiscal operating cash flow to be adequate to fund fiscal year operating needs  shareholder dividend requirements and planned capital expenditures 
our planned capital expenditures are related to additional production capacity  new products and services  productivity programs  information systems and replacement items 
we have million of senior notes that are due on may  our cash and our revolving credit agreement are sufficient to retire these notes upon maturity 
investing activities our capital expenditures were million in fiscal  an increase from million in fiscal capital expenditures primarily increased our capacity and supported new product development activities in our fluid management segment and replaced equipment at our other business units

indebtedness under the agreement is unsecured except for the pledge of the stock of our us subsidiaries and two thirds of the stock of certain non us subsidiaries 
at august  we had no borrowings under the agreement 
we have million of standby letters of credit outstanding at august  these standby letters of credit are primarily used as security for advance payments received from customers 
under the agreement we have million of unused borrowing capacity 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the more critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time of title passage to our customer 
in instances where we have equipment installation obligations  the revenue related to the installation service is deferred until installation is complete 
we recognize revenue for certain longer term contracts based on the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method requires estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method since we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost applicable to various stages of the contract 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that gave rise to the revision become known 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
significant estimates made by us include the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  deferred tax asset valuation allowance  warranty  litigation  product liability and environmental accruals  goodwill valuation and retirement benefit obligations 
our estimate for uncollectible accounts receivable is based upon an analysis of our prior collection experience  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends within the industries we serve 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us eg  bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings  we record a specific reserve to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
inventory valuation reserves are determined based on our assessment of the market conditions for our products and the on hand quantities of inventory in relation to historical usage 
the inventory to which this reserve relates is still on hand and will be sold or disposed of in the future 
the expected selling price of this inventory approximates its net book value  therefore there is no significant impact on gross margin when it is sold 
we have recorded valuation allowances to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized based upon our analysis of estimated future taxable income and establishment of tax strategies 
future taxable income  reversals of temporary differences  available carryback periods  the results of tax strategies and changes in tax laws could impact these estimates 
warranty obligations are contingent upon product failure rates  material required for the repairs and service and delivery costs 
we estimate the warranty accrual based on specific product failures that are known to us plus an additional amount based on the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales 
we record litigation  product liability and environmental reserves based upon a case by case analysis of the facts  circumstances and estimated costs 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare our consolidated financial statements 
these estimates are subject to change as conditions within and beyond our control change  including but not limited to economic conditions  the availability of additional information and actual experience rates different from those used in our estimates 
accordingly  actual results may differ from these estimates 
goodwill goodwill is tested on an annual basis  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
impairment tests  which involve the use of estimates related to the fair market values of the business operations with which goodwill is associated  were performed at year end for fiscal our annual impairment test date using a discounted cash flow methodology income approach 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the businesses for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the 
table of contents future cash flows of these businesses 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over their estimated remaining useful lives 
losses  if any  resulting from impairment tests are reflected in operating income in our consolidated statement of operations 
foreign currency accounting gains and losses resulting from the settlement of a transaction in a currency different from that used to record the transaction are charged or credited to net income or loss when incurred 
adjustments resulting from the translation of non us financial statements into non us dollars are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss for all non us units 
we use permanently invested intercompany loans as a source of capital to reduce the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our foreign subsidiaries 
these loans are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
therefore  we record foreign exchange gains or losses on these intercompany loans in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
pensions we maintain defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans that provide retirement benefits to substantially all us employees and certain non us employees 
pension expense for fiscal and beyond is dependent on a number of factors including returns on plan assets and changes in the plan s discount rate and therefore cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
the following paragraphs discuss the significant factors that affect the amount of recorded pension expense 
a significant factor in determining the amount of expense recorded for a funded pension plan is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we develop the long term rate of return assumption based on the current mix of equity and debt securities included in the plan s assets and on the historical returns on those types of investments  judgmentally adjusted to reflect current expectations of future returns 
at august  the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets was 
in addition to the expected rate of return on plan assets  recorded pension expense includes the effects of service cost the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period and interest on the plan s liabilities to participants 
these amounts are determined actuarially based on current discount rates and assumptions regarding matters such as future salary increases and mortality 
differences in actual experience in relation to these assumptions are generally not recognized immediately but rather are deferred together with asset related gains or losses 
when cumulative asset related and liability related gains or losses exceed the greater of of total liabilities or the calculated value of plan assets  the excess is amortized and included in pension income or expense 
at august   the weighted average discount rate used to value the plan liabilities was 
we determine our discount rate based on an actuarial yield curve applied to the payments we expect to make out of our retirement plans 
additional changes in the key assumptions discussed above would affect the amount of pension expense currently expected to be recorded for years subsequent to specifically  a one half percent decrease in the rate of return on assets assumption would have the effect of increasing pension expense by approximately million 
a comparable increase in this assumption would have the opposite effect 
in addition  a one half percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase expense by approximately million 
new accounting pronouncement in september the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas no 

sfas no 
requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its balance sheet  and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
in july the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial 
table of contents statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
fin is effective as of the beginning of fiscal years that start after december  september  for the company 
management is currently evaluating the requirements or fin and has not yet determined the impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable 
sfas no 
also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measures on earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for the company s fiscal year  although early adoption is permitted 
we are currently assessing the potential impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
this standard permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the fair value option permits a company to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
a company will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings after adoption 
sfas no 
will be effective for us beginning in fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact sfas no 
could have on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain operations in the us and foreign countries 
we have market risk exposure to foreign exchange rates in the normal course of our business operations 
our significant non us operations have their local currencies as their functional currency and primarily buy and sell using that same currency 
we manage our exposure to net assets and cash flows in currencies other than us dollars by minimizing our non us dollar net asset positions 
we also enter into hedging transactions  primarily currency swaps  under established policies and guidelines that enable us to mitigate the potential adverse impact of foreign exchange rate risk 
we do not engage in trading or other speculative activities with these transactions as established policies require that these hedging transactions relate to specific currency exposures 
our main foreign exchange rate exposures relate to assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in british pounds  euros  swiss francs and canadian dollars and the general economic exposure that fluctuations in these currencies could have on the us dollar value of future us cash flows 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on us for fiscal  the net unhedged exposures in each currency were remeasured assuming a decrease in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar 
using this method  our ebit for fiscal would have decreased by million and our cash flow from operations for fiscal would have decreased by million 
this calculation assumed that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  these changes may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not include any effects of potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices 
we also have market risk exposure to interest rates 
at august   we had million in interest bearing debt obligations subject to market risk exposure due to changes in interest rates 
to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates  we attempt to maintain a balance between fixed and variable rate debt 
we expect this balance in the debt profile to moderate our financing cost over time 
we are limited in our ability to refinance our fixed rate debt 
however  we have the ability to change the characteristics of our fixed rate debt to variable rate debt through interest rate swaps to achieve our objective of balance 
we have an interest rate swap agreement that effectively modifies a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
this agreement involves the receipt of fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without an exchange of underlying principal amounts 
the mark to market values of both the fair value hedging instrument and the underlying debt obligation were equal and recorded as offsetting gains and losses in current period earnings 
the fair value hedge qualifies for treatment under the short cut method of measuring effectiveness 
as a result  there was no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness 
the interest rate swap agreement totals million  expires in and allows us to receive an effective interest rate of and pay an interest rate based on libor 
at august   million of our outstanding debt had a weighted average fixed interest rate of and million had a weighted average variable interest rate of 
the estimated fair value of our debt at august  was approximately million 
the following table presents the aggregate maturities and related weighted average interest rates of our debt obligations at august  by maturity dates 
table of contents us dollar us dollar us dollar fixed rate variable rate variable rate maturity date amount rate amount rate amount rate thereafter total fair value following is information regarding our long term contractual obligations and other commitments outstanding as of august  payments due by period two to long term contractual one year three four to after five obligations total or less years five years years in thousands debt obligations capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations operating leases consist primarily of building and equipment leases 
the only other commercial commitments outstanding were standby letters of credit of  of this outstanding amount  is due within a year   within two to three years and  due within four to five years
