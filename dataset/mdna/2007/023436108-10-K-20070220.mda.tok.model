index to financial statements our market and opportunity home health expenditures in the united states were approximately billion in  according to national health expenditure data 
the home health industry is comprised of facility based and hospital based agencies owned by publicly traded and privately held companies  visiting nurse associations and nurse registries 
the industry remains highly fragmented and we believe it represents an attractive consolidation opportunity 
medicare is the largest single home health payor  accounting for billion  or  of total home health spending 
these expenditures are expected to increase substantially over the coming years  growing to billion by according to the office of the actuary of the center for medicare and medicaid services cms  the us federal agency that administers medicare 
there are approximately  medicare certified home health agencies currently in operation 
medicare is also the largest payor in the hospice industry  with an estimated billion of expenditures in according to cms 
we believe many of the same growth dynamics in the home health sector are driving growth in the hospice industry 
according to the medicare payment advisory commission medpac  between and the number of medicare beneficiaries utilizing hospice increased and the share of medicare decedents in hospice increased from to 
the hospice industry is similar to home health in that it is a highly fragmented market and has a relatively small number of companies of significant size 
we believe it represents an attractive growth opportunity 
our strategy our objective is to be the leading provider of high quality  low cost home health services in each market in which we operate 
to achieve this objective  we intend to focus on medicare eligible patients 
the rapidly growing population of medicare beneficiaries represents a compelling market for home health and hospice providers 
implementation of the prospective payment system pps in the home health industry has created a relatively stable reimbursement environment favoring companies such as ours that focus on providing high quality  low cost home health and hospice services 
emphasize internal growth 
we emphasize the internal growth of medicare patient admissions  which increased approximately for the year ended december  we drive internal growth by maintaining an emphasis on high quality care  expanding and enhancing referral relationships in our local and regional markets  continuing to educate referral sources regarding our specialized programs that focus on high cost chronic conditions and diseases  developing strategic relationships with large hospital systems to increase admission volume  expanding our service coverage areas by developing new locations  and attracting and retaining highly skilled and experienced employees through communication  education  empowerment and competitive benefits 
grow through strategic acquisitions 
we believe our focus on medicare beneficiaries and our size and national reputation provides us with a strategic advantage when assessing potential acquisitions 
the majority of home health agencies and hospice programs are owned either by hospitals or independent operators 
we employ a disciplined acquisition strategy based on defined acquisition criteria  including high quality service  a strong referral base and compatible payor mix 
leverage our cost efficient operating structure 
we believe the size and scale of our infrastructure and operating systems offer the opportunity to achieve operating leverage at both the agency and corporate level 
at the agency level  we have developed a cost efficient operating model that focuses on productivity  per episode utilization and clinical outcomes  among other measures 
to manage our diverse network of locations  we use a proprietary information system that reduces administrative and operating costs through the integration of clinical  financial and operating functions 
we manage all patient care and utilization on a real time basis from both a clinical and financial perspective through a system of exception reporting 
at the corporate level  our geographic focus and investment in infrastructure and information systems enable us to leverage regional and senior management resources and add new locations without proportionate increases in corporate expense

index to financial statements continue to develop and deploy specialized programs for chronic diseases and conditions 
we have developed specialized services that focus on high cost diseases and chronic conditions and have successfully launched programs for diabetes  coronary artery disease  congestive heart failure  orthopedics  complex wound care  geriatric surgical recovery and behavioral health  among others 
our specialty programs represent an attractive growth opportunity because they combine clinical quality and hour access  seven days a week  which is appealing to patients and physicians  with cost effective delivery of high quality nursing care to patients who have high cost or chronic conditions 
our competitive strengths we believe the following competitive strengths contribute to our strong market share in each of the markets in which we operate and will enable us to grow our business successfully and increase profitability primary emphasis on medicare home health 
our primary focus is on providing home health services to medicare beneficiaries  and we derive approximately of our revenues from medicare 
we recruit and retain caregivers who are attentive to  and familiar with  the specialized needs of the elderly population 
we deploy specialized nursing programs that focus on the high cost diseases and conditions prevalent in the and older demographic segment 
we believe these efforts position us competitively to take advantage of recent cms initiatives designed to deliver disease management services to seniors with high cost or chronic conditions 
additionally  there are other benefits to our medicare focus 
for example  our billing and collections are simplified when compared to other health care providers because of our emphasis on the medicare reimbursement process 
proven operating model 
our home health model balances the benefits of promoting local agency responsibility and accountability for quality of care and operating results with the efficiencies gained from centralizing key administrative functions 
our home health agencies carry locally recognized branding and tailor their respective marketing efforts to address the specific needs of the communities  referral sources and medicare beneficiaries they serve 
agency management teams work to establish strong relationships in their communities and with referral sources 
to support our local management teams  we have centralized accounting  regulatory  marketing  payroll  intake  billing  collections  risk management and quality assurance functions 
we have deployed standardized clinical programs and believe this initiative has improved quality of care and risk management through the implementation of best practices  which helps us actively manage clinical compliance across all of our home health agencies 
in addition  our operations typically have access to more resources and financial management expertise than locally owned competitors 
integrated technology and management systems 
we have invested in information technology and real time management and monitoring capabilities that allow us to standardize the care delivered across our system and monitor the status of the patients we treat 
under the pps  the majority of our revenue is pre determined at admission based on a range of clinical criteria and the local wage index 
monitoring and controlling the time and costs associated with the care we provide is essential to maintaining our operating margins and profitability 
our real time monitoring capability has contributed significantly to our ability to manage admissions growth 
we believe that most competing providers lack the resources to implement similar systems 
we believe our investment in technology enhances our ability to provide the quality and outcomes data required by cms 
in addition  we are deploying point of care poc laptop devices  as further described under technology  to our clinical staff to enhance the accuracy of patient information and further improve our compliance controls 
demonstrated ability to identify and integrate acquisitions 
we believe that we have a demonstrated track record of identifying  evaluating  acquiring and integrating companies in the home health and hospice markets 
we attribute part of our success in integrating these agencies to our rigorous due diligence process prior to completing acquisitions 
we employ a disciplined strategy based on defined acquisition criteria  including high service quality  a strong referral base  a compatible payor mix and

index to financial statements opportunities for cost savings and significant internal growth 
we have also developed a comprehensive post acquisition strategic plan to facilitate the integration of acquired agencies that includes improving operating margins  recruiting qualified nurses and account executives  expanding relationships with local physicians and discharge planners  expanding the breadth and quality of services and transitioning acquired agencies onto our information technology platform 
significant cash flow from operations and relatively low capital expenditures 
we generate significant cash flow from operations due to the profitable operation of our business and active management of our working capital 
our capital expenditure requirements are low because our services do not require the purchase and replacement of expensive medical equipment 
historically  our maintenance capital expenditures have amounted to less than of our revenue 
patient oriented company culture 
we believe that we have developed a strong patient oriented culture that emphasizes quality of care 
we communicate frequently with our employees and provide education opportunities along with competitive benefits 
we reinforce our culture not only through an orientation program for new employees  but also an ongoing emphasis on the importance of high quality patient care and the need to remain productive while keeping our costs low 
we keep our employees informed about corporate events and solicit feedback regarding ways to improve our services and their working environment 
we also provide extensive sales and compliance training for our employees as part of their ongoing education 
our home health agencies as of december   we operated medicare certified home health agencies in states primarily in the southern and southeastern united states 
a director and team of administrative professionals lead each agency and have primary responsibility for the day to day operations 
our agencies are staffed with experienced clinical home health professionals who provide a wide range of patient care services 
our home health operations are organized into six regions  each of which provides clinical  operational and sales support 
to support our local agencies  we have centralized accounting  regulatory  marketing  payroll  intake  billing  collections  risk management and quality assurance functions 
all of our agencies are accredited or in the process of seeking accreditation by the joint commission on accreditation of health care organizations jcaho 
we deliver health related services in the home to eligible individuals who require ongoing skilled nursing and associated care 
our patients are typically recovering  disabled  or chronically or terminally ill persons in need of medical  nursing  social  or therapeutic treatment and assistance with the essential activities of daily living 
we provide a wide variety of home health services including registered nursing services such as infusion therapy  skilled monitoring  assessments and patient education  licensed practical nursing services  including performance of technical procedures  administration of medications and changing of surgical and medical dressings  physical and occupational therapy to strengthen muscles  restore range of motion and help patients perform the activities of daily living  speech pathology and therapy to restore communication and oral skills  social work to help families address the problems associated with acute and chronic illnesses  home health aide services to perform personal care such as bathing or assistance in walking  and private duty services such as continuous hourly nursing care and sitter services 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our hospice agencies as of december   we operated medicare certified hospice agencies in four states in the southern and southeastern united states 
our hospice agencies provide palliative care and comfort to terminally ill patients of all age groups and their families 
we provide hospice services to each patient using an interdisciplinary care team comprised of a physician  a patient care manager  registered nurses  certified home health aides  social workers  a chaplain  a homemaker and specially trained volunteers 
this team develops a plan of care and delivers  monitors and coordinates that plan with the goal of providing appropriate care for the patient and their family 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing efforts are directed primarily at physicians and hospital discharge planners  who are responsible for referring patients to home health and hospice agencies 
marketing activities are coordinated locally by the individual agency and are supplemented by regional sales management and dedicated corporate personnel 
these activities generally emphasize the benefits offered by our home health and hospice agencies as compared to other providers in the market  such as our focus on addressing the unique needs of medicare beneficiaries  our specialized programs and focus on specific disease and chronic conditions such as diabetes  coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure  orthopedics and wound care  our ability to schedule and coordinate patient assessment and admission  when appropriate  with little to no inconvenience to the patient  and our size and scale 
although the agency director is the primary point of contact  physicians who utilize our agencies are important sources of recommendations to other physicians regarding the benefits of using our services 
each agency director develops a target list of physicians and discharge planners  and we continually review these marketing lists and the progress in contacting and successfully attracting additional local referral sources 
technology the development and enhancement of our information technology systems continues to be a key component of our strategy 
we have invested significant time and resources enhancing the capabilities of our technology platform in recent years to provide us with a potential strategic advantage over competitors 
we have standardized and have automated most of the critical components of the operational  clinical  financial and compliance related processes at our locations 
we have implemented a wide area network that connects all of our agencies to a central corporate system 
this infrastructure allows us to introduce standardized programs to all of our locations in a highly efficient manner and to monitor and manage critical clinical and financial aspects of patient care and utilization on a real time basis 
through our poc  we are streamlining the process by which our visiting home health nurses accumulate information while in the residences of our patients 
this initiative includes providing our visiting staff with laptop computers that allow them to document all relevant clinical information 
this significantly reduces paper processing and duplicative work while contributing to a higher degree of accuracy and expediting the billing process 
we had approximately agencies on line as of december  and anticipate that the rollout will be complete in mid we have developed and utilize a proprietary windows based clinical software system to collect assessment data  schedule and log patient visits  generate medical orders and monitor treatments and outcomes in accordance with established medical standards 
we have enhanced this software extensively utilizing employed development staff 
our billing and collection software has been designed to ease the flow of information to our accounting  payroll  human resources and employee benefit software and is used throughout our operations 
we intend to continue our efforts to improve the clinical  financial and compliance applications of our information technology systems 

table of contents 
index to financial statements until such time as our poc system is fully operational  we will continue to use document recognition software developed by healthcare quality systems hqs that enables our agencies to scan assessment forms into our clinical system  which reduces the amount of time spent on data entry  standardizes the data collection process and significantly reduces data entry errors 
each assessment from our agencies is sent electronically to hqs  which uses a proprietary software system of smart edits to flag inconsistencies and errors in order to assist our nurses to make necessary corrections 
assessments are then provided to us electronically by hqs and automatically uploaded to our clinical and operational systems 
once the data is integrated into our clinical system  it is used in all of our processing functions 
compliance and quality improvement we are a health care services business and the quality and reputation of our personnel and operations are critical to our success 
we develop  implement and maintain comprehensive compliance and quality improvement programs as a component of the centralized corporate services provided to our home health and hospice agencies 
our compliance program includes a code of ethical conduct for our employees and affiliates and a process for reporting regulatory or ethical concerns to our chief compliance officer  including a toll free telephone hotline 
we have a compliance committee  which is chaired by the chief compliance officer and is comprised of our chief executive officer  chief operating officer  the senior vice president of clinical operations and the senior vice president of human resources 
this corporate compliance committee reviews and recommends appropriate courses of action for handling compliance issues 
the effectiveness of our compliance program is directly related to the legal and ethical training that we provide to our employees 
compliance education for new hires is initiated immediately upon employment with corporate video and on line training 
this education is reinforced through regional corporate orientation during the quarter following an employee s hire date when the chief compliance officer conducts a comprehensive compliance training seminar along with both the chief executive officer and the chief operating officer 
moreover  we conduct specific compliance training targeting employees in specific areas of the company 
in particular  all employees in our corporate offices and in the field that are involved in the billing process are required to participate in an annual billing compliance seminar that is led by the chief compliance officer and is conducted at various  regional sites each year 
additionally  billing staff are also required to complete an annual billing compliance training and certification course  which includes a video and workbook  as well as a post test requiring accuracy in order to maintain employment 
all newly hired sales employees receive additional training from the chief compliance officer in conjunction with business development orientation 
in addition  all of our employees are required to receive continuing compliance education and training each year 
we conduct periodic compliance surveys of all of our agencies  which include audits of patient charts and documentation to ensure compliance with medicare regulations 
audit findings and corresponding action plans are routed to both the chief compliance officer and the senior vice president of operations 
our proprietary disease management programs and clinical protocols ensure that consistent  quality care is delivered across the organization and are a critical component of improving patient outcomes 
we utilize the federal government s outcome based quality improvement scores and the home health outcome compare scores to measure the quality of our services and to monitor the effectiveness of our quality improvement initiatives 
we also use outside consultants to provide independent data and analysis to support our quality improvement initiatives 
one such consulting firm benchmarks clinical activities and outcomes for all of our agencies against state  regional and national averages and provides individual agency rankings across a host of categories that enable us to identify trends in the delivery of care 
another independent firm provides computer software systems that analyze our billings to ensure that assessment forms are completed properly and that internally mandated assessment methodologies and coding procedures are followed 
this software system identifies any assessment or billing trends that are exceptions to corporate guidelines 
our compliance and quality improvement programs are intended to ensure that our employees are well trained and capable of delivering high quality service 
we incorporate compliance staffing and oversight into our growth plans and believe our consistent focus on compliance and quality improvement provides us with a competitive advantage in the market

index to financial statements reimbursement patient eligibility and payors medicare is a federally funded and administered health insurance program  primarily for individuals entitled to social security benefits who are years of age or older or who are disabled 
the medicare home health benefit is available to patients who need care following discharge from a hospital  as well as patients who suffer from chronic conditions that require ongoing but intermittent care 
the services received need not be rehabilitative or of a finite duration  however  patients who require full time skilled nursing for an extended period of time generally do not qualify for medicare home health benefits 
as a condition of participation under medicare  beneficiaries must be homebound in that they are unable to leave their home without considerable effort  require intermittent skilled nursing  physical therapy or speech therapy services that are covered by medicare  and receive treatment under a plan of care that is established and periodically reviewed by a physician 
qualifying patients may also receive reimbursement for occupational therapy  medical social services and home health aide services if these additional services are part of a plan of care prescribed by a physician 
there is no limit to the number of episodes a beneficiary may receive as long as they remain eligible 
the medicare hospice benefit is available to medicare eligible patients who have advanced illnesses and are certified by a physician as having a life expectancy of six months or less 
revenue from our home health and hospice services is derived from medicare  medicaid  private insurance carriers  managed care organizations  individuals and other health insurance programs 
medicaid  a program jointly funded by federal  state and local governmental health care programs  is designed to pay for certain health care and medical services provided to low income individuals without regard to age 
we also have several contracts for negotiated fees with insurers and managed care organizations 
home health reimbursement under pps  we receive a standard prospective medicare payment for delivering care over a base day period episode of care 
most patients complete treatment within one payment episode  though multiple continuous episodes are allowed 
the base payment  which is established through federal legislation  is a flat rate that is adjusted upward or downward to account for differences in the expected resource needs of individual patients as indicated by clinical severity  functional severity and service utilization 
the adjustment is derived from each patient s categorization into one of payment groups  known as home health resource groups  and the cost of care for patients in each group relative to the average patient 
our payment is also adjusted for differences in local prices using the hospital wage index 
we bill and are reimbursed for services in two stages an initial claim when the episode commences and a final claim when it is completed 
we receive of the estimated payment for a patient s initial episode upon admission after the initial assessment is completed and billed and the remaining upon completion of the episode and after all final treatment orders are signed by the physician 
in the event of subsequent episodes  reimbursement is paid up front and upon completion of the episode 
final payments may reflect one of five retroactive adjustments an outlier payment if the patient s care was unusually costly  a low utilization adjustment if the number of visits was fewer than five  a partial payment if the patient transferred to another provider before completing the episode  a change in condition adjustment if the patient s medical status changed significantly  resulting in the need for more or less care  or a payment adjustment based upon the level of therapy services required 
we submit all medicare claims through two fiscal intermediaries for the federal government 
since implementation of pps in october  the base episode payment has varied due to the impact of annual market basket based increases and medicare related legislation 
the base payment for a medicare home health episode was  for each of the years ended december  and in november  cms announced a increase to medicare home health rates for  which will increase the base payment rate to  in addition  cms announced the elimination of the rural add on  an additional stipend that we receive for patients in approximately of our markets for episodes beginning after december  further  of the proposed increase is contingent upon home health providers reporting ten clinical quality measures

index to financial statements through outcome and assessment information set oasis 
cms has collected and published oasis data since and has indicated that it is considering using this data to reward providers with superior outcomes 
we collect and submit oasis data for all of our medicare episodes and believe we provide high quality services 
based upon a historical trend study evaluating approximately  episodes during the period october  through september   we believe that the change in the medicare reimbursement rate will positively impact our medicare revenues by to in hospice reimbursement hospice services became a covered benefit under medicare in medicare distinguishes between four levels of hospice care routine home care  general inpatient care  continuous home care  and respite care 
medicare reimburses for services based on a standard prospective rate for delivering care over a base day or day period 
more than of hospice care is classified as routine home care  which had a per diem reimbursement rate of for the period november  to october  for the period november  to october   cms approved a rate increase for hospice services 
government regulation our home health and hospice businesses are highly regulated by federal  state and local authorities 
regulations and policies frequently change and we monitor changes through trade and governmental publications and associations 
we also meet regularly with a group of financial  legal and regulatory consultants to discuss emerging issues that may affect our business 
our home health and hospice subsidiaries are certified by cms and are therefore eligible to receive reimbursement for services through the medicare system 
our agencies also are subject to federal  state and local laws dealing with issues such as occupational safety  employment  medical leave  insurance  civil rights  discrimination  building codes and other environmental issues 
federal  state and local governments are expanding the regulatory requirements on businesses 
the imposition of these regulatory requirements may have the effect of increasing our operating costs and reducing the profitability of our operations 
certificates of need and permits of approval home health and hospice agencies have licenses granted by the health authorities of their respective states 
additionally  state health authorities in states require a certificate of need con or  as it is referred to in arkansas  a permit of approval poa in order to establish and operate a home health agency and twelve states require a con to operate a hospice agency 
we have home health agencies in the following con states alabama  arkansas poa  georgia  kentucky  maryland  mississippi  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee and west virginia 
we have hospice locations in only one con state  tennessee 
in every state where required  our locations possess a license and or con or poa issued by the state health authority that determines the local service areas for the home health or hospice agency 
states with con and poa laws place limits on the construction and acquisition of health care facilities and operations and expansion of existing facilities and services 
in these states  approvals are required for capital expenditures exceeding amounts above the stated thresholds 
state con and poa laws generally provide that  prior to the addition of new capacity  the construction of new facilities or the introduction of new services  a designated state health planning agency must determine that a need exists for those beds  facilities or services 
the process is intended to promote comprehensive health care planning  assist in providing high quality health care at the lowest possible cost and avoid unnecessary duplication by ensuring that only those health care facilities and operations that are needed will be built and opened 

table of contents 
index to financial statements medicare participation approximately of our revenue during  and was received from medicare  and we expect to continue to receive the majority of our revenues from serving medicare beneficiaries 
to participate in the medicare program and receive medicare payments  our agencies must comply with regulations promulgated by the department of health and human services 
among other things  these regulations  known as conditions of participation  relate to the type of facility  its personnel and its standards of medical care  as well as its compliance with state and local laws and regulations 
federal and state anti kickback laws as a provider under the medicare and medicaid systems  we are subject to the various anti fraud and abuse laws  including the federal health care programs anti kickback statute and  where applicable  their state law counterparts 
these laws prohibit any offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce or reward the referral of business reimbursable under a federal health care program or in return for the purchase  lease  order  arranging for  or recommendation of items or services covered by any federal health care programs or any health care plans or programs that are funded by the united states government other than certain federal employee health insurance benefits and certain state health care programs that receive federal funds under various programs  such as medicaid 
a related law forbids the offer or transfer of any item or service for less than fair market value  or certain waivers of co payment obligations  to a beneficiary of medicare or a state health care program that is likely to influence the beneficiary s selection of health care providers 
violations of the anti fraud and abuse laws can result in the imposition of substantial civil and criminal penalties and  potentially  exclusion from furnishing services under any federal health care program 
in addition  the states in which we operate generally have laws that prohibit certain direct or indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements between health care providers where they are designed to obtain the referral of patients from a particular provider 
stark laws congress adopted legislation in  known as the stark law  that generally prohibits a physician from ordering clinical laboratory services for a medicare beneficiary where the entity providing that service has a financial relationship including direct or indirect ownership or compensation relationships with the physician or a member of his her immediate family  and prohibits such entity from billing for or receiving reimbursement for such services  unless a specified exception is available 
additional legislation  known as stark ii  became effective january  that legislation extends the stark law prohibitions to services under state medicaid programs and beyond clinical laboratory services to all designated health services  including  but not limited to  home health services  durable medical equipment and supplies  parenteral and enteral nutrients  equipment and supplies 
violations of the stark laws may also trigger civil monetary penalties and program exclusion 
pursuant to stark ii  physicians who are compensated by us are prohibited from seeking reimbursement for designated health services rendered to such patients unless an exception applies 
one such exception we use is a safe harbor that allows us to contract with certain physicians at fair market value to provide consulting work to our agencies 
another such exception that we make use of is a safe harbor allowing us to lease office space from certain physicians at fair market value for legitimate and commercially reasonable business purposes 
several of the states in which we conduct business have also enacted statutes similar in scope and purpose to the federal fraud and abuse laws and the stark laws 
hipaa the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa was enacted august  to assure health insurance portability  reduce health care fraud and abuse  guarantee security and privacy of health information and enforce standards for health information 
organizations were required to be in compliance with certain hipaa provisions relating to security and privacy beginning april  organizations are subject to significant fines and penalties if found not to be compliant with the provisions outlined in the regulations

index to financial statements regulations issued pursuant to hipaa impose ongoing obligations relative to training  monitoring and enforcement and management has implemented processes and procedures to ensure continued compliance with these regulations 
pursuant to the provisions of hipaa  covered health care providers are required to be compliant with the regulation s electronic health care transactions and code sets requirements 
in conformity with these federal regulations  we are now capable of transmitting data in the new standard format 
insurance we are obligated for certain costs under various insurance programs  including employee health  workers compensation and professional liability  and while we maintain various insurance programs to cover these risks  we are self insured for a substantial portion of our potential claims 
we recognize our obligations associated with these costs in the period in which a claim is incurred  including with respect to both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported  up to specified deductible limits 
these costs have generally been estimated based on independent actuarial analysis and historical data of our claims experience 
such estimates  and the resulting reserves  are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
we are self insured for employee health claims up to contractual policy limits 
claims in excess of  are insured by a third party insurance carrier 
as of december   our accrual for both outstanding and incurred but not reported claims was million based upon independent actuarial estimates 
as of december  our obligations were partially collateralized by deposits of million 
we are self insured for workers compensation claims up to  claims in excess of  are insured by a third party insurance carrier 
we have elected to either fund our carrier with a letter of credit or a deposit for the purpose of guaranteeing the payment of claims 
our deposits may be depleting or non depleting 
a depleting deposit allows the carrier to draw upon the funds in order to pay the claims 
where we have provided a non depleting deposit  the carrier invoices us each month for reimbursement of claims that they have paid 
our accrual at december  for both outstanding and incurred but not reported claims  as determined by an independent actuarial estimate  was million  of which million is included in other long term obligations on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   our obligations were partially collateralized by deposits of million and letters of credit of million 
we maintain insurance coverage with per claim deductible limits of  with respect to professional liability 
as of december  our accrual for both outstanding claims and incurred but not reported claims was million based upon actual claims outstanding and actuarial estimates 
in the case of potential liability with respect to employment and other matters where litigation may be involved  or where no insurance coverage is available  our policy is to use advice from both internal and external counsel as to the likelihood and amount of any potential cost 
such estimates  and the resulting reserves  are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
we maintained reserves of million for all such claims as of december  the estimate for claims incurred under certain employee related liabilities has been discounted at the prevailing risk free rate for government issues of an appropriate duration as of december  all other self insured liabilities are undiscounted 
we maintain directors and officers insurance with an aggregate annual limit of million 
competition we compete with local  regional and national home health and hospice providers for referrals based primarily on scope and quality of services  geographic coverage  outcome data and  in selected instances  pricing 
the impact of this competition is best determined on a market by market basis 
our primary competitors for our home health business are hospital based home health agencies  local home health agencies and visiting nurse 
table of contents 
index to financial statements associations 
we compete with other home health providers on the basis of availability of personnel  quality and expertise of services and the value and price of services 
in addition  there are relatively few barriers to entry in some of the home health and hospice markets in which we operate 
we believe our generally favorable competitive position is attributable to our reputation for consistent  high quality care  comprehensive range of services  state of the art information management systems and widespread service network 
employees at december   we had  employees  of which  were full time employees 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement

risk factors investing in our common stock involves risk  including the risks we describe below 
you should consider carefully the following risks  as well as other information in this filing and the incorporated documents  before investing in our common stock 
if any of the following risks occur  our results of operations  financial condition and business could be harmed materially and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
risks related to our industry our revenue is substantially derived from medicare 
reductions in medicare rates  rate increases that do not cover cost increases and or significant changes to the current medicare reimbursement methodology may adversely affect our business 
we generally receive fixed payments from medicare for our home health services based on the level of care that we provide patients 
reductions to medicare rates and or changes in medicare reimbursement methodology could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 
medicare payments could be reduced as a result of changes in the way medicare pays providers that provide significant therapy services to beneficiaries  or administrative or legislative changes to the base episode rate  the elimination or reduction of annual rate increases based on medical inflation  adjustments to the relative components of the wage index used in determining reimbursement rates  the imposition by medicare of co payments or other mechanisms shifting responsibility for a portion of payment to beneficiaries  the reclassification of home health resource groups  other adverse changes to payment rates or payment methodologies 
although current medicare legislation provides for an annual adjustment of the various payment rates based on increases or decreases in the medical care expenditure category of the consumer price index  this adjustment may be less than actual inflation in any given year or could be reduced or eliminated in any given year 
in fact  the home health industry received no increase to the medicare reimbursement rate in

cms has collected and published oasis data since and has indicated that it is considering using this data to reward providers with superior outcomes 
we collect and submit oasis data for all of our medicare episodes and believe we provide high quality services 
based upon a historical trend study evaluating approximately  episodes during the period october  through september   we believe that the change in the medicare reimbursement rate will positively impact our medicare revenues by to in we cannot assure you that we will receive medicare reimbursement rate increases in the future 
overall payments made by medicare to us for hospice services are subject to two payment limitations  known as hospice caps  calculated by the medicare fiscal intermediary on an annual basis 
under the first limitation  total medicare payments to us per provider number are compared to a hospice cap amount that is calculated by multiplying the number of medicare beneficiaries under that provider number electing hospice care for the first time during the cap period by a statutory amount that is indexed for inflation 
the cap amount per medicare beneficiary for the twelve month period ending october  is  we must return any payments in excess of the cap amount to medicare 
the second hospice cap  which is also calculated on a per provider number basis  provides that reimbursement for any in patient days that exceed of the total in service days for the particular provider number shall be reimbursed at a lower rate 
our ability to avoid these limitations depends on a number of factors  each determined on a provider number basis  including the average length of stay and mix in level of care 
revenue and profitability associated with our hospice operations may be materially reduced if we are unable to avoid triggering these and other medicare payment limitations 
as we expand our hospice operations  we cannot be certain that we will not exceed the cap amounts in the future 
thus  we cannot assure you that these limitations will not negatively affect our profitability on a company wide basis in the future 
further  for our hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state medicaid programs who elect hospice care under medicare or medicaid  the state must pay us  in addition to the applicable medicare or medicaid hospice per diem rate  an amount equal to at least of the medicaid per diem nursing home rate for room and board furnished to the patient by the nursing home 
we contract with various nursing homes for the nursing homes provision of certain room and board services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide medicaid nursing home patients 
we bill and must collect from the applicable state medicaid program an amount equal to at least of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing home under the state s medicaid plan 
under our standard nursing home contracts  we generally pay the nursing home for these room and board services in advance of reimbursement from medicaid at of the medicaid per diem nursing home rate 
approximately of our hospice patients reside in nursing homes 
consequently  the reduction or elimination of medicare payments for hospice patients residing in nursing homes  our ability to collect for these services or any change in our ability to provide service to such patients would significantly reduce the net patient service revenue and profitability related to our hospice operations or may have an adverse effect on our bad debt expense 
if any of our agencies fail to comply with the conditions of participation in the medicare program  that agency could be terminated from the medicare program  which would adversely affect our net patient service revenue and profitability 
each of our home health and hospice agencies must comply with the extensive conditions required of participation in the medicare program 
if any of our agencies fail to meet the medicare conditions of participation  that agency may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable state surveyor 
if that agency then fails to institute a plan of correction to remediate the deficiency within the correction period provided by the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements state surveyor  that agency could be terminated from the medicare program 
any termination of one or more of our home health agencies from the medicare program for failure to satisfy the program s conditions of participation could adversely affect our net service revenue and profitability 
cms has announced that it is currently revising the medicare conditions of participation for home health  with publication expected no earlier than the second half of we do not know at this time what effect the revisions will have on our operations  and there can be no assurances that the revisions will not negatively affect our profitability 
in addition  we are subject to various routine and non routine reviews  audits and investigations by the medicare and medicaid programs and other federal and state governmental agencies 
violation of the laws governing our operations  or changes in interpretations of those laws  could result in the imposition of fines  civil or criminal penalties  the termination of our rights to participate in federal and state sponsored programs and or the suspension or revocation of our licenses 
if we become subject to material fines or if other sanctions or other corrective actions are imposed on us  we might suffer a substantial reduction in profitability 
we are subject to extensive government regulation 
any changes to the laws and regulations governing our business  or the interpretation and enforcement of those laws or regulations  could cause us to modify our operations and could negatively impact our operating results 
the federal government and the states in which we operate regulate our industry extensively 
the laws and regulations governing our operations  along with the terms of participation in various government programs  regulate how we do business  the services we offer and our interactions with patients and the public and impose certain requirements on us relating to  among other things licensure and certification  adequacy and quality of health care services  qualifications of health care and support personnel  quality of medical equipment  confidentiality  maintenance and security issues associated with medical records and claims processing  relationships with physicians and other referral sources  operating policies and procedures  addition of facilities and services  and billing for services 
these laws and regulations  and their interpretations  are subject to frequent change 
changes in existing laws and regulations  or their interpretations  or the enactment of new laws or regulations could reduce our profitability by increasing our liability  increasing our administrative and other costs  increasing or decreasing mandated services  forcing us to restructure our relationships with referral sources and providers  or requiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems 
for example  congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  which mandates that provider organizations enhance privacy protections for patient health information 
this requires companies like us to develop  maintain and monitor administrative  information and security systems to prevent inappropriate release of protected health information 
compliance with this law has added  and will continue to add  costs that affect our profitability 
failure to comply with hipaa s privacy and security requirements could result in substantial fines and penalties 

table of contents 
index to financial statements if we are unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources  our growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
our success depends significantly on referrals from physicians  hospitals and other patient referral sources in the communities that our agencies serve  as well as on our ability to maintain good relationships with these referral sources 
our referral sources are not contractually obligated to refer home health or hospice patients to us and may refer their patients to other providers 
our growth and profitability depend on our ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of the benefits of home health and hospice care by our referral sources and their patients 
we may not be able to maintain our existing referral source relationships or develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets 
our loss of  or failure to maintain  existing relationships or our failure to develop new referral relationships could adversely affect our ability to expand our operations and operate profitably 
we are subject to federal and state laws that govern our financial relationships with physicians and other health care providers  including potential or current referral sources 
we are required to comply with federal and state laws  generally referred to as anti kickback laws  that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or other financial arrangements between health care providers that are designed to encourage the referral of patients to a particular provider for medical services 
in addition to these anti kickback laws  the federal government has enacted specific regulations  commonly known as the stark law  that prohibit certain financial relationships  specifically including ownership interests and compensation arrangements  between physicians and providers of designated health services  such as home health agencies  to whom said physicians refer patients 
some of these same financial relationships are subject to regulation by the individual states as well 
under both the anti kickback law and stark law  there are a number of safe harbors that permit certain  carefully constrained relationships 
amedisys avails itself of these safe harbors in several instances 
for example  we currently have contractual relationships with certain physicians who provide consulting services to our company 
many of these physicians are current or potential referral sources 
in addition  in some of our local markets  we lease office space from physicians who may also be referral sources 
we cannot assure you that courts or regulatory agencies will not interpret state and federal anti kickback laws and state laws regulating relationships between health care providers in ways that will implicate our practices 
violations of these laws could lead to fines or sanctions that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may be subject to substantial malpractice or other similar claims 
the services we offer involve an inherent risk of professional liability and related substantial damage awards 
as of december   we had over  direct care employees working for our home health agencies and over direct care employees working for our hospice agencies 
in addition  we employ direct care workers on a contractual basis 
on any given day  the majority of these nurses  therapists and other direct care personnel are driving to and from patients homes where they deliver medical and other care 
due to the nature of our business  we and the caregivers who provide services on our behalf may be the subject of medical malpractice claims 
these caregivers could be considered our agents  and  as a result  we could be held liable for their medical negligence 
we cannot predict the effect that any claims of this nature  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could have on our business or reputation or on our ability to attract and retain patients and employees 
we maintain malpractice liability insurance and are responsible for amounts in excess of the limits of our coverage 
an economic downturn  continued deficit spending by the federal government and state budget pressures in states in which we operate could result in a reduction in reimbursement and covered services 
the existing federal deficit  as well as deficit spending by the government as the result of adverse developments in the economy or other reasons  could lead to increased pressure to reduce government expenditures for other purposes  including governmentally funded programs in which we participate  such as medicare and medicaid 
such actions in turn could adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements an economic downturn could have a detrimental effect on our revenues 
historically  state budget pressures have translated into reductions in state spending 
given that medicaid outlays are a significant component of state budgets  we can expect continuing cost containment pressures on medicaid outlays for our services in the states in which we operate 
in addition  an economic downturn may also affect the number of enrollees in managed care programs as well as the profitability of managed care companies  which could result in reduced reimbursement rates 
our industry is highly competitive  with relatively few barriers to entry in some markets 
our home health agencies compete with local and regional home health companies  hospitals  nursing homes and other businesses that provide home health services  some of which are large established companies that have significantly greater resources than we do 
in addition  there are relatively few barriers to entry in some of the home health services markets in which we operate 
our primary competition comes from local companies in each of our markets and these privately owned or hospital owned health care providers vary by region and market 
we compete based on the availability of personnel  the quality  expertise and value of our services  and in select instances  on the price of our services 
increased competition in the future from existing competitors or new entrants may limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share 
some of our existing and potential new competitors may enjoy greater name recognition and greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
this may permit our competitors to devote greater resources than we can to the development and promotion of services 
these competitors may undertake more far reaching and effective marketing campaigns and may offer more attractive opportunities to existing and potential employees and services to referral sources 
we expect our competitors to develop new strategic relationships with providers  referral sources and payors  which could result in increased competition 
the introduction of new and enhanced service offerings  in combination with industry consolidation and the development of strategic relationships by our competitors  could cause a decline in revenue or loss of market acceptance of our services or make our services less attractive 
additionally  we compete with a number of non profit organizations that can finance acquisitions and capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis or receive charitable contributions that are unavailable to us 
managed care organizations and other third party payors have continued to consolidate in order to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of health care services 
consequently  the health care needs of a large percentage of the united states population are increasingly served by a smaller number of managed care organizations 
these organizations generally enter into service agreements with a limited number of providers for needed services 
to the extent that such organizations terminate us as a provider and or engage our competitors as a preferred or exclusive provider  our business could be adversely affected 
in addition  private payors  including managed care payors  could seek to negotiate additional discounted fee structures or the assumption by health care providers of all or a portion of the financial risk through prepaid capitation arrangements  thereby potentially reducing our profitability 
we expect that industry forces will continue to have an impact on our business and that of our competitors 
in recent years  the health care industry has undergone significant changes driven by efforts to reduce costs and we expect these cost containment measures to continue in the future 
frequent regulatory changes in our industry  including reductions in reimbursement rates and changes in services covered  have increased competition among home health providers 
if we are unable to react competitively to new developments  our operating results may suffer 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements state efforts to regulate the establishment or expansion of health care providers could impair our ability to expand our operations 
some states require health care providers including skilled nursing facilities  hospices  home health agencies and assisted living facilities to obtain prior approval  known as a certificate of need  or con  or as it is referred to in some states  a permit of approval  or poa  for the purchase  establishment or expansion of health care facilities  capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  or changes in services or bed capacity 
to the extent that we require a con  poa or other similar approvals to expand our operations  either by acquiring facilities or expanding or providing new services or other changes  our expansion could be adversely affected by the failure or inability to obtain the necessary approvals  changes in the standards applicable to those approvals and possible delays and expenses associated with obtaining those approvals 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain a con or poa for all future projects requiring that approval 
additionally  our ability to expand operations in a state will depend on our ability to obtain a state license to operate 
states may have a limit on the number of licenses they issue 
for example  as of december   we operated home health agencies and one hospice agency in louisiana 
louisiana currently has a moratorium on the issuance of new home health agency licenses through july  we cannot predict whether this moratorium will be extended beyond this date or whether any other states in which we currently operate  or may wish to operate in the future  may adopt a similar moratorium 
our failure to obtain any license  con or poa could impair our ability to operate or expand our business 
a shortage of qualified registered nursing staff and other caregivers could adversely affect our ability to attract  train and retain qualified personnel and could increase operating costs 
we rely significantly on our ability to attract and retain caregivers who possess the skills  experience and licenses necessary to meet the requirements of our patients 
we compete for personnel with other providers of home health and hospice services 
our ability to attract and retain caregivers depends on several factors  including our ability to provide these caregivers with attractive assignments and competitive benefits and salaries 
we cannot assure you that we will succeed in any of these areas 
in addition  there are occasional shortages of qualified health care personnel in some of the markets in which we operate 
as a result  we may face higher costs of attracting caregivers and providing them with attractive benefit packages than we originally anticipated  and  if that occurs  our profitability could decline 
finally  although this is currently not a significant factor in our existing markets  if we expand our operations into geographic areas where health care providers historically have unionized  we cannot assure you that negotiating collective bargaining agreements will not have a negative effect on our ability to timely and successfully recruit qualified personnel 
generally  if we are unable to attract and retain caregivers  the quality of our services may decline and we could lose patients and referral sources 
risks related to our business our revenue is substantially derived from medicare 
reductions in medicare rates  rate increases that do not cover cost increases and or significant changes to the current medicare reimbursement methodology may adversely affect our business 
for the years ended december   and  we received of our revenue from medicare 
we generally receive fixed payments from medicare for our home health services based on the level of care that we provide patients 
consequently  our profitability largely depends upon our ability to manage the cost of providing those services 

table of contents 
index to financial statements future cost containment initiatives undertaken by private third party payors may limit our future revenues and profitability 
our non medicare revenues and profitability also are affected by the continuing efforts of third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care by lowering reimbursement rates  narrowing the scope of covered services  increasing case management review of services and negotiating reduced contract pricing 
any changes in reimbursement levels from these third party payor sources and any changes in applicable government regulations could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
there is no guarantee that third party payors will provide us with timely payments for our services 
we can provide no assurance that we will continue to maintain our current payor or revenue mix 
migration of our medicare beneficiary patients to medicare managed care providers could negatively impact our operating results 
historically  we have generated the majority of our revenue from the medicare fee for service market 
under the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of december  however  congress allocated significant additional funds and other incentives to medicare managed care providers in order to promote greater participation in those plans by medicare beneficiaries 
if these increased funding levels have the intended result  the size of the potential medicare fee for service market could decline  thereby reducing the size of our potential patient population  which could cause our operating results to suffer 
our allowance for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts may not be sufficient to cover uncollectible amounts 
on an ongoing basis  we estimate the amount of medicare  medicaid and private insurance receivables that we will not be able to collect 
this allows us to calculate the expected loss on our receivables for the period we are reporting 
our allowance for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts may underestimate actual unpaid receivables for various reasons  including adverse changes in our estimates as a result of changes in payor mix and related collection rates  inability to collect funds due to missed filing deadlines or inability to prove that timely filings were made  adverse changes in the economy generally exceeding our expectations  or unanticipated changes in reimbursement from medicare  medicaid and private insurance companies 
if our allowance for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts is insufficient to cover losses on our receivables  our business  financial position or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
delays in reimbursement may cause liquidity problems 
our business is characterized by delays in reimbursement from the time we provide services to the time we receive reimbursement or payment for these services 
if we have difficulty in obtaining documentation  such as physician orders  information system problems or issues that arise with medicare or other providers  we may encounter additional delays in our payment cycle 
timing delays may cause working capital shortages 
working capital management  including prompt and diligent billing and collection  is an important factor in achieving our financial results and maintaining liquidity 
it is possible that documentation support  system problems  medicare or other provider issues or industry trends may extend our collection period  adversely impacting our working capital  and that our working capital management procedures may not successfully negate this risk 
a provision in the deficit reduction act of  which was passed by congress earlier this year  caused a brief delay in reimbursement to our home health agencies by medicare 
the provision stipulated that cms make no payments on medicare home health claims during the last nine days of the federal fiscal year  which ended 
table of contents 
index to financial statements september  no interest was accrued or paid by cms  and no late penalties were paid to providers for delays in payment due to this hold 
as a result of the hold  the timing of our cash flows was negatively impacted and million of payments we would have received over the last nine days of september were delayed until october  we may experience delays in reimbursement in the future that may cause us liquidity problems 
our hospice operations may also experience reimbursement delays 
our hospice operations bill various state medicaid programs for room and board associated with hospice patients residing in nursing homes that we routinely pay in advance of receipt of payment from the provider 
in addition  we have experienced timing delays when attempting to collect funds from state medicaid programs in certain instances 
delays in receiving reimbursement or payments from these programs may adversely impact our working capital 
our growth strategy depends on our ability to manage growing and changing operations 
our business has grown significantly in size and complexity in recent years 
our internal growth rate for medicare patient admissions was approximately  and for  and  respectively 
this growth has placed  and will continue to place  significant demands on our management systems  internal controls and financial and professional resources 
in addition  we will need to further develop our financial controls and reporting systems to accommodate future growth 
this could require us to incur expenses for hiring additional qualified personnel  retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding our information technology infrastructure 
our inability to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
our growth strategy depends on our ability to open agencies  acquire additional agencies on favorable terms and integrate and operate these agencies effectively 
if our growth strategy is unsuccessful or we are not able to successfully integrate newly acquired or opened agencies into our existing operations  our future results could be adversely impacted 
we expect to continue to open agencies in our existing and new markets 
our new agency growth  however  will depend on several factors  including our ability to obtain locations for agencies in markets where need exists  identify and hire a sufficient number of appropriately trained home health and other health care professionals  obtain adequate financing to fund growth  and operate successfully under applicable government regulations 
we are focusing significant time and resources on the acquisition of home health and hospice agencies  or of certain of their assets  in targeted markets 
not only do we face competition for acquisition candidates  which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and may lead to higher acquisition prices  but we may also be unable to identify  negotiate and complete suitable acquisition opportunities on reasonable terms 
additionally  acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties  including difficulties in recouping partial episode payments and other types of misdirected payments for services from the previous owners  difficulties integrating acquired personnel and business practices into our business  the potential loss of key employees or patients of acquired agencies  and the assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired agencies 
we may not be able to fully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with our current business structure in an efficient and cost effective manner 
the failure to effectively integrate any of these businesses could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our acquisitions may impose strains on our existing resources 
as a result of our past and current acquisition strategy  we have grown significantly over the last two years 
as we continue to add acquisition related revenue and expand our markets  our growth could strain our 
table of contents 
index to financial statements resources  including management  information systems  regulatory compliance  logistics and other controls 
we cannot assure you that our resources will keep pace with our anticipated growth 
if we do not manage our expected growth effectively  our future results could be adversely affected 
our inability to effectively integrate  manage and keep secure our information systems could disrupt our operations 
our business depends on effective and secure information systems that assist us in  among other things  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  processing claims  reporting financial results  measuring outcomes and quality of care  managing regulatory compliance controls and maintaining operational efficiencies 
these systems include software developed in house and systems provided by external contractors and other service providers 
to the extent that these external contractors or other service providers become insolvent or fail to support the software or systems  our operations could be negatively affected 
our agencies also depend upon our information systems for accounting  billing  collections  risk management  quality assurance  payroll and other information 
if we experience a reduction in the performance  reliability  or availability of our information systems  our operations and ability to produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely affected 
our information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
our acquisition activity requires transitions and integration of various information systems 
we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities 
if we experience difficulties with the transition and integration of information systems or are unable to implement  maintain  or expand our systems properly  we could suffer from  among other things  operational disruptions  regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches  including unauthorized access to patient data stored in our information systems  and the introduction of computer viruses to our systems 
our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations would be negatively impacted by cancellation of contracts and loss of patients if security breaches are not prevented 
we are implementing a new poc system that includes providing laptop computers to our staff 
we anticipate that laptops will be provided to all of our full time home health visiting clinicians by the later half of we have installed privacy protection systems and devices on our network and the poc laptops in an attempt to prevent unauthorized access to information in our database 
however  our technology may fail to adequately secure the confidential health information we maintain in our databases and protect it from theft or inadvertent leakage 
in such circumstances  we may be held liable to our patients and regulators  which could result in litigation or adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
even if we are not held liable  any resulting negative publicity could harm our business and distract the attention of management 
further  our information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins and similar events 
a failure to restore our information systems after the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because of the confidential health information we store and transmit  loss of electronically stored information for any reason could expose us to a risk of regulatory action  litigation  possible liability and loss 
failure of  or problems with  our clinical software system could harm our business and operating results 
we have developed and utilize a proprietary windows based clinical software system to collect assessment data  schedule and log patient visits  generate medical orders and monitor treatments and outcomes in accordance with established medical standards 
the system integrates billing and collections functionality as well as accounting  human resource  payroll and employee benefits programs provided by third parties 
problems with

any such problems or failures could adversely affect our operations and reputation  result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to provide our services in the future 
the costs incurred in correcting any errors or problems may be substantial and could adversely affect our profitability 
we depend on outside software providers 
we depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems in operating our business  some of which are provided by outside software providers 
these information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
if our providers are unable to maintain or expand our information systems properly  we could suffer from operational disruptions and an increase in administrative expenses  among other things 
we are operating under a corporate integrity agreement 
violations of that agreement could result in penalties or exclusion from participation in the medicare program 
in  we uncovered certain improprieties stemming from the unauthorized conduct of an agency director in an agency we had acquired in monroe  louisiana 
we self reported these improprieties to the office of the inspector general  or oig 
following an extensive series of audits  we reached a settlement with the federal government in august  whereby we agreed to repay approximately million to the government in three annual payments  the last of which we made in august as part of the settlement  we also executed a three year corporate integrity agreement cia  which required  among other things  that we maintain our training and compliance programs  provide additional  specific training in certain areas  conduct annual  independent audits of the monroe agency  and make timely disclosure of  and repay  overpayments resulting from any potential fraud or abuse of which we became aware 
the term of the cia expired on august  notwithstanding this expiration  we have continuing obligations under the cia 
for example  we are required to submit final annual reports and audits  must grant the oig inspection and review rights for days post filing of the final annual report  and must retain records of our compliance with the cia through august we may become subject to other such settlements or agreements in the future 
our compliance with state and federal fraud and abuse provisions and regulations may be subject to future government review and interpretation and possible regulatory actions currently unknown or unasserted 
if we are found to be in violation of any of these provisions  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we also operate our agencies under licenses issued and regulated by the respective states in which they are located 
each agency is subject to periodic surveys and complaint based surveys 
if a survey identifies violations of state standards  the agency typically is afforded a grace period in which to comply or otherwise lose its license to operate 
if we are found to be in violation of any of these state standards  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our insurance liability coverage may not be sufficient for our business needs 
we maintain professional liability insurance for us and our subsidiaries 
however  we cannot assure you that claims will not be made in the future in excess of the limits of such insurance  nor can we assure you that any such claims  if successful and in excess of such limits  will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business or on our assets 
our insurance coverage also includes fire  property damage and general liability with varying limits 
we cannot assure you that the insurance we maintain will satisfy claims made against us 
in addition  as a result of operating in the home health industry  our business entails an inherent risk of claims  losses and potential lawsuits alleging incidents involving our employees that are likely to occur in a patient s home 
we cannot assure you that insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at commercially reasonable rates  in adequate amounts or on satisfactory terms 

table of contents 
index to financial statements any claims made against us  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  could damage our reputation and business 
from december  to november   we were insured for risks associated with professional and general liability by an insurance company that currently is in liquidation under federal bankruptcy laws and may not be able to pay or defend claims incurred by us during this period  and our current insurance does not cover any such claims 
we do not  however  believe that the ultimate resolution of current claims will be materially different from reserves established for them or that any material claims will be made in the future based on occurrences during that period 
we are self insured against certain potential liabilities and our insurance reserves may be inadequate if unexpected losses occur 
we are self insured for health insurance and workers compensation claims up to  and  respectively  per incident and maintain appropriate reserves to cover anticipated payments 
insurance reserves are recorded based on estimates made by management and validated by third party actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure such estimates are within acceptable ranges 
actuarial estimates are based on detailed analyses of health care cost trends  mortality rates  claims history  demographics  industry trends and federal and state law 
as a result  the amount of reserve and related expense may be significantly affected by the outcome of these studies 
calculation of the estimated accrued liability for self insured claims remains subject to inherent liability and significant and adverse changes in the experience of claims settlement and other underlying assumptions could negatively impact operating results 
we have established reserves for medicare liabilities that may be payable by us in the future 
these liabilities may be subject to audit or further review  and we may owe additional amounts beyond what we expect and have reserved for 
prior to the implementation of the pps on october   we recorded medicare revenue at the lower of actual costs  the per visit cost limit  or a per beneficiary cost limit on an individual provider basis 
we determined ultimate reimbursement upon review of annual cost reports 
as of december   we have estimated an aggregate payable to medicare of million  all of which is reflected as a current liability in our consolidated financial statements 
the million liability has two components a cost report adjustments reserve million and pps payment adjustments reserve million 
if actual amounts exceed our reserves  we may incur additional costs that may adversely affect our results of operations 
cost report adjustments reserve 
the recorded million cost report adjustments reserve relates to cost report reserves filed prior to the implementation of the pps 
the reserve includes a million obligation of a wholly owned subsidiary that is currently in bankruptcy and which we could be responsible for if the debt of the subsidiary is not discharged in bankruptcy  a balance of million  which represents the final payment to settle certain and cost reports that will be remitted in the near future and a balance of million that reflects our estimate of amounts likely to be assessed by medicare as overpayments in respect of prior years when medicare audits of our cost reports through october are completed 
we cannot be sure that we have accurately evaluated this liability and estimated an appropriate reserve 
pps payment adjustments reserve 
the remaining balance of million is related to notice from cms that it intends to seek recovery of overpayments that were made for patients who had  within days of a readmission to home health prior to the expiry of days from the previous admission date at another home health agency  been discharged from inpatient facilities  including hospitals  rehabilitation and skilled nursing units for the periods dating from the implementation of the pps on october  through particular dates in and we cannot be sure that we have accurately evaluated this liability and estimated an appropriate reserve 
if we must write off a significant amount of intangible assets or long lived assets  our earnings will be negatively impacted 
because we have grown in part through acquisitions  goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets 
goodwill was approximately million as of december  if we 
table of contents 
index to financial statements make additional acquisitions  it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements 
we also have long lived assets consisting of property and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets of million as of december   which we review both on a periodic basis as well as when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if a determination that a significant impairment in value of our unamortized intangible assets or long lived assets occurs  such determination could require us to write off a substantial portion of our assets 
such a write off would negatively affect our earnings 
we depend on the services of our executive officers and other key employees 
our success depends upon the continued employment of certain members of our senior management team  including our chairman and chief executive officer  william f 
borne and our president and chief operating officer  larry r

our operations could be affected by natural disasters or terrorist acts 
our corporate office and a substantial number of our agencies are located in the southeastern united states and the gulf coast region  increasing our exposure to hurricanes and other natural disasters 
the occurrence of natural disasters in the markets in which we operate could not only affect the day to day operations of our agencies  but could also disrupt our relationships with patients  employees and referral sources located in the affected areas and  in the case of our corporate office  our ability to provide administrative support services  including  for example  billing and collection services 
in addition  any episode of care that is not completed due to the impact of a natural disaster will generally result in lower revenue for the episode 
for example  in late august and early september  hurricanes katrina and rita impacted our agencies  employees and patients located in southern louisiana and southern mississippi 
to date  only one of our agencies affected by hurricanes katrina and rita  located in chalmette  louisiana  has not reopened 
also  for a period of time after the hurricane  other agencies located in the louisiana gulf coast region operated at lower capacities and our corporate headquarters was adversely impacted as employees domiciled in affected areas recovered from the disaster 
we cannot assure you that hurricanes or other natural disasters will not have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations in the future 
in addition  the occurrence of terrorist acts and the erosion to our business caused by such an occurrence  could adversely affect our profitability 
in the affected areas  our offices could be forced to close for limited or extended periods of time 
we may be held responsible for some or all of the million liability of a bankrupt subsidiary 
we consolidate the net liabilities of alliance home health  inc  or alliance  a bankrupt subsidiary that is no longer in operation  in our consolidated financial statements 
alliance was acquired in and ceased operations in alliance filed for chapter federal bankruptcy protection with the united states bankruptcy court in the northern district of oklahoma on september  a trustee was appointed for alliance in on january   a federal judge from the united states bankruptcy court in the northern district of oklahoma bankruptcy court overseeing the chapter federal bankruptcy protection proceedings for alliance home health  inc issued an order approving a proposed distribution of funds to creditors 
the case is still subject to the issuance of a final closing order  at which time we will be informed of our final obligation  if any 
until such time as the final closing order is issued  we will continue to consolidate the alliance contingencies that net to a million dollar liability

the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of securities  particularly securities of health care companies 
the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors  including our operating and financial performance  variances in our quarterly financial results compared to research analyst expectations  the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock  future sales of common stock or the perception that sales could occur  investor and analyst perception of our business and our prospects  developments relating to litigation or governmental investigations  changes or proposed changes in health care laws or regulations or enforcement of these laws and regulations  or announcements relating to these matters  departure of key personnel  changes in the medicare  medicaid and private insurance reimbursement rates for home health and hospice  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  or general economic and stock market conditions 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq global select market in particular  has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of health care provider companies 
these broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their respective securities 
we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future 
litigation of this type is often expensive to defend and may divert our management team s attention as well as resources from the operation of our business 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the availability of those shares for future sale  could adversely affect our stock price and limit our ability to raise capital 
at december    shares of our common stock were outstanding 
there are  shares of our common stock that may be issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
as of december    shares of our common stock were issuable upon the exercise of stock options which were outstanding but not exercisable   shares of our common stock were issuable upon the exercise of stock options which were outstanding and exercisable  and  shares of our common stock were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public or the perception that substantial sales could occur 
these sales also may make it more difficult for us to sell common stock in the future to raise capital 
in the past we have had to defend class action lawsuits  and there is no assurance that we will not face similar suits in the future that could require us to pay substantial damage awards 
on august and october   two class action lawsuits  which were later consolidated  were filed on behalf of all purchasers of our common stock between november  and june   against us and

index to financial statements three of our executive officers  in the united states district court for the middle district of louisiana 
the suits sought damages based on the decline in our stock price following an announced restatement of earnings for the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  alleging that our management knew or were reckless in not knowing the facts giving rise to the restatement 
on june   we entered into a settlement agreement for  with the ten individual plaintiffs in these two lawsuits 
on july   the united states district court for the middle district of louisiana issued an order dismissing the consolidated lawsuits 
we cannot assure you that we will not face similar suits in the future that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our board of directors may use anti takeover provisions or issue stock to discourage control contests 
our certificate of incorporation currently authorizes us to issue up to  shares of common stock and  shares of undesignated preferred stock 
our board of directors may cause us to issue additional stock to discourage an attempt to obtain control of the company 
for example  shares of stock could be sold to purchasers who might support the board of directors in a control contest or to dilute the voting or other rights of a person seeking to obtain control 
in addition  the board of directors could cause us to issue preferred stock entitling holders to vote separately on any proposed transaction  convert preferred stock into common stock  demand redemption at a specified price in connection with a change in control  or exercise other rights designed to impede a takeover 
the issuance of additional shares may  among other things  dilute the earnings and equity per share of our common stock and the voting rights of common stockholders 
we have implemented other anti takeover provisions or provisions that could have an anti takeover effect  including advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals and a stockholder rights plan  also known as a poison pill 
these provisions  and others that the board of directors may adopt hereafter  may discourage offers to acquire us and may permit our board of directors to choose not to entertain offers to purchase us  even if such offers include a substantial premium to the market price of our stock 
therefore  our stockholders may be deprived of opportunities to profit from a sale of control 
item properties our corporate headquarters are located in baton rouge  louisiana in a building that we own that consists of approximately  square feet 
typically  our home health and hospice agencies are located in leased facilities 
generally  the leases have initial terms of three years  but range from one to six years 
most of the leases contain options to extend the lease period for up to five additional years 
item legal proceedings legal proceedings we are involved in legal actions in the normal course of business  some of which seek monetary damages  including claims for punitive damages  which may not be covered by our insurance 
these actions  when finally concluded and determined  will not  in our opinion  have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  collectibility of accounts receivable  reserves related to insurance and litigation  intangible assets and contingencies 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we

index to financial statements believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in these consolidated financial statements 
business combinations accounted for as purchases are included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition 
revenues we earn revenues through our home health and hospice agencies by providing a variety of services in the homes of our patients 
we are dependent on reimbursement from medicare for a significant portion of our revenues 
we derived approximately of our net service revenue from the medicare system and the remaining from medicaid  private insurance companies and private payors for each of the years ended december   and medicare revenue recognition on october   medicare began paying home health providers at fixed  predetermined rates for services and supplies bundled into day episodes of home health care 
an episode of home health care spans a day period  starting with the first day a billable visit is furnished to a medicare beneficiary and ending days later 
if a patient is still in treatment on the th day  a new episode begins on the st day regardless of whether a billable visit is rendered on that day and ends days later 
the first day of a consecutive episode  therefore  is not necessarily the new episode s first billable visit 
a base episode payment is established by the medicare program through federal legislation for all episodes of care  as follows period base episode payment october  through march  april  through december  january  through december  january  through december  the actual episode payment rates  as presented in the table  vary depending on the home health resource groups hhrgs to which medicare patients are assigned and the per episode payment is typically reduced or increased by such factors as the patient s clinical  functional  and services utilization characteristics 
as further described in recent developments  on november   cms announced a increase to medicare home health rates for episodes ending on or after january  and before january  our episodes that began prior to december  but will not conclude until subsequent to december  will be reimbursed at the rate in effect for under the prospective payment system pps for medicare reimbursement  net revenues are recorded based on a reimbursement rate that varies based on the severity of the patient s condition  service needs and other factors 
net revenues are recorded as services are rendered to patients over the day episode period 
at the end of each month  a portion of our revenue is estimated for episodes in progress 
medicare reimbursement  on an episodic basis  is subject to adjustment if there are significant changes in the patient s condition during the treatment period or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period 
revenue recognition under the medicare reimbursement program is based on certain variables including  but not limited  to i changes in the base episode payments established by 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the medicare program  ii adjustments to the base episode payments for partial episodes and for other factors  such as case mix  geographic wages  low utilization and intervening events  and  iii recoveries of overpayments 
adjustments to revenue result from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
revenue recognition for episodes in progress is estimated based upon historical trends 
we continuously compare the estimated medicare reimbursement amounts recorded to the actual medicare reimbursement received 
historically  any difference between estimated amounts recorded and actual amounts received from medicare has been immaterial 
management believes based on information available and our judgment that changes to one or more of the factors that impact the accounting estimate  which are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  will not materially impact our reported financial results  our liquidity or our future financial results 
deferred revenue of approximately million and million relating to the medicare pps program was included as a reduction to our accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and december   respectively  since only a nominal amount of deferred revenue represents cash collected in advance of providing services 
hospice revenue recognition hospice services are generally billed to medicare weekly for discharged patients and monthly for ongoing care 
each hospice provider is subject to payment caps for inpatient services  and the cap is based on inpatient days that cannot exceed of all medicare hospice days 
overall medicare reimbursement is also subject to a cap amount calculated by the medicare fiscal intermediary at the end of each hospice cap period 
on a monthly and quarterly basis  we estimate our potential cap exposure using information available for both inpatient day limits as well as per beneficiary cap amounts 
the total cap amount for each provider is calculated by multiplying the number of beneficiaries electing hospice care during the period by a statutory amount that is indexed for inflation 
the per beneficiary cap amount was  for the twelve month period ending october  in august  cms announced a rate increase for the twelve month period beginning november  any amounts received in excess of the beneficiary cap must be refunded to medicare within fifteen days 
we have settled all years through october  without exceeding any of the cap limits and believe that  based upon our calculations and historical experience  we have not exceeded any of the cap limits and will have no amounts due the fiscal intermediary for the cap period ending october   which is expected to be settled in mid management believes that changes to one or more of the factors that impact the accounting estimate for hospice revenue  which are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  will not materially impact our reported financial results  our liquidity or our future financial results 
medicaid revenue recognition medicaid  a program jointly funded by federal  state  and local governmental health care programs  is designed to pay for certain health care and medical services provided to low income individuals without regard to age 
revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which services are provided 
private insurance companies and private payor revenue recognition we have entered into agreements with third party payors that provide payments for services rendered at amounts different from established rates 
gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established rates or estimated reimbursement rates  as applicable 
allowances and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements contractual adjustments are recorded for the difference between the established rates and the amounts estimated to be payable by third parties and are deducted from gross revenue to determine net service revenue 
net service revenue is the estimated net amounts realizable from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered  including estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements 
revenue is recorded as services are rendered and is based upon discounts from established rates 
we receive less than one percent of our net revenues from patients who are either self insured or are obligated for an insurance co payment 
collectibility of accounts receivable in the year ended december   our accounts receivable increased  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts  from million at december  to million  and days revenue outstanding decreased from days at december  to days 
the improvement in days revenue outstanding was due primarily to the collection of million in medicare payments that had been delayed due to pending changes of ownership requirements related to acquired businesses and the write off of approximately million in uncollectible accounts that was fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
this was partially offset by collection efforts related to hospice reimbursement  which is now a larger portion of our outstanding accounts receivable and is generally subject to slower cash collections in comparison to our home health agencies 
the following schedule details our accounts receivable by payor class  aged based upon initial date of service current over total amounts in thousands december  medicare medicaid private total allowance for doubtful accounts net accounts receivable days revenue outstanding december  medicare medicaid private total allowance for doubtful accounts net accounts receivable days revenue outstanding accounts receivable includes final unbilled amounts of million and million as of december  and december   respectively  that have been aged based upon initial service date 
due to our significant acquisitions and our internal growth  our calculation for days revenue outstanding is derived by dividing the ending gross accounts receivable  net of contractual allowances  at december  and by the average daily net patient revenues for the three month periods ended december  and  respectively 
the process for estimating the ultimate realization of accounts receivable involves judgment  with the greatest subjectivity relating to non medicare accounts receivable 
our collection process begins with a concerted effort to ensure that our billings are accurate 

table of contents 
index to financial statements medicare we derive approximately of our net service revenue from medicare 
our pre billing process includes an electronic medicare claim review referred to as a scrubber to improve the quality of filed claims data in an effort to reduce the volume of collection effort on these accounts 
a portion of the estimated medicare prospective payment system reimbursement from each submitted home health episode is received in the form of a request for accelerated payment rap 
we submit a rap for of the estimated reimbursement for the initial episode at the start of care 
the full amount of the episode is billed after the episode has been completed final billed 
the rap received for that particular episode is deducted from the final payment 
if a final bill is not submitted within the greater of days from the start of the episode  or days from the date the rap was paid  any raps received for that episode will be recouped by medicare from any other claims in process for that particular provider 
the rap and final claim must then be re submitted 
for any subsequent episodes of care contiguous with the first episode for a particular patient  we submit a rap for instead of of the estimated reimbursement 
final payments from medicare may reflect one of five retroactive adjustments a an outlier payment if the patient s care was unusually costly  b a low utilization adjustment if the number of visits was fewer than five  c a partial payment if the patient transferred to another provider before completing the episode  d a change in condition adjustment if the patient s medical status changes significantly  resulting in the need for more or less care  or e a payment adjustment based upon the level of therapy services required in the population base 
management estimates the impact of these payment adjustments based on historical experience and records this estimate during the period that the services are rendered as a contractual adjustment to revenue 
as such  we believe that the amount that is reflected in our accounts receivable accurately represents the amount that we believe will be reimbursed by medicare 
non medicare we derive approximately of our net service revenue from non medicare providers 
non medicare accounts are billed based upon payor requirements and include multiple third party payors 
we routinely perform pre billing reviews to improve the quality of filed claims and in purchased and are in the process of implementing new software to assist us in improving the quality of electronically submitted claims 
to provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts to reduce the carrying amount of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
our review and evaluation of our non medicare accounts includes a detailed review of outstanding balances and special consideration to concentrations of receivables from particular payors or groups of payors with similar characteristics that would subject us to any significant credit risk 
where such groups have been identified  we have given special consideration to both the billing methodology and our evaluation of the ultimate collectibility of such accounts 
in addition  the amount of the provision for bad debts is based upon our assessment of historical and expected net collections  business and economic conditions  trends in reimbursement and an evaluation of collectibility based upon the date that the service was provided 
uncollectible accounts are written off when we have determined the account will not be collected 
as of december   our provision for uncollectible accounts was million 
based upon our best judgment  we believe that this amount adequately provides for accounts that will not be collected 
insurance we are obligated for certain costs under various insurance programs  including employee health  workers compensation and professional liability  and while we maintain various insurance programs to cover these risks  we are self insured for a substantial portion of our potential claims 
we recognize our obligations associated with these costs in the period in which a claim is incurred  including with respect to both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported  up to specified deductible limits 
these costs have generally been estimated based on independent actuarial analysis and historical data of our claims experience 
such estimates  and the resulting reserves  are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we are self insured for employee health claims up to contractual policy limits 
claims in excess of  are insured by a third party insurance carrier

we are self insured for workers compensation claims up to  claims in excess of  are insured by a third party insurance carrier 
we have elected to either fund our carrier with a letter of credit or a deposit for the purpose of guaranteeing the payment of claims 
our deposits may be depleting or non depleting 
a depleting deposit allows the carrier to draw upon the funds in order to pay the claims 
where we have provided a non depleting deposit  the carrier invoices us each month for reimbursement of claims that they have paid 
as of december  and  our accrual for both outstanding and incurred but not reported claims as determined by an independent actuarial estimate was million and million  respectively  which million and million  respectively  is included in other long term obligations on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december  and  our obligations were partially collateralized by deposits with the carriers net of claims already paid of million and million  respectively and outstanding letters of credit totaled million and million  respectively 
we maintain insurance coverage with per claim deductible limits of  with respect to professional liability 
as of december  and our accrual for both outstanding claims and incurred but not reported claims was million and million  respectively  based upon actual claims outstanding and actuarial estimates 
in the case of potential liability with respect to employment and other matters where litigation may be involved  or where no insurance coverage is available  our policy is to use advice from both internal and external counsel as to the likelihood and amount of any potential cost 
such estimates  and the resulting reserves  are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
we maintained reserves of million and million for all such claims as of december  and  respectively 
the estimate for claims incurred under certain employee related liabilities has been discounted at the prevailing risk free rate for government issues of an appropriate duration as of december  all other self insured liabilities are undiscounted 
we maintain directors and officers insurance with an aggregate annual limit of million 
while we believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures  there can be no assurance that we will not incur liabilities in excess of recorded reserves or in excess of our insurance limits 
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived assets as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

the impairment analysis requires numerous subjective assumptions and estimates to determine fair value of the respective reporting units as required by sfas no

depending on changes in medicare reimbursement  admissions volume and other factors  we may be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 
income taxes we use the asset and liability approach for measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences existing at each balance sheet date using currently enacted tax rates in accordance with sfas no

index to financial statements certain estimates about future operations 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect of a change in tax rate is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
as of december  and  our net deferred tax liabilities were million and million  respectively  representing an increase of million 
the increase was primarily related to an increase of million related to revenue tax timing differences  an increase of million to the deferred tax liability related to property and equipment as a result of accelerated depreciation pursuant to the gulf opportunity zone act of  and million in additional amortization of tax basis goodwill 
medicare settlement issues prior to october   reimbursement of medicare home care services was based on reasonable  allowable costs incurred in providing services to eligible beneficiaries subject to both per visit and per beneficiary limits in accordance with the interim payment system established through the balanced budget act of these costs were reported in annual cost reports that were filed with cms and were subject to audit by the fiscal intermediary engaged by cms 
the fiscal intermediary has not finalized its audit of the fiscal cost reports 
furthermore  settled cost reports relating to certain years prior to fiscal could be subject to reopening of the audit process by the fiscal intermediary 
included in our reserves is a medicare settlement obligation of a wholly owned subsidiary that is currently in bankruptcy  and it is not clear whether we will have any responsibility for that amount if the debt of the subsidiary is discharged in bankruptcy 
although we believe that established reserves are sufficient  it is possible that adjustments resulting from such audits and the final resolution of our potential obligation related to the bankruptcy could result in adjustments to our consolidated financial statements that are different from our established reserves

fsp r  which amends fsp r  addresses instruments originally issued as employee compensation and later modified solely to reflect an equity restructuring that occurs when the holders are no longer employees 
in that situation  no change in the recognition or measurement due to change in classification of those instruments will result if i there is no increase in the fair value of the award  or an antidilution provision is not added to the terms of the award in contemplation of an equity restructuring  and ii all holders of the same class of equity instruments are treated in the same manner 
the guidance in fsp r is to be applied in the first reporting period beginning after october  with early adoption allowed for periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
we do not believe that the application of this guidance will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the us securities and exchange commission sec adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which expresses the sec s staff views on the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
sab requires that registrants consider evaluating errors under both the rollover and iron curtain approaches to determine if such errors are material  thus requiring a restatement to prior period financial statements 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november  and allowed the registrant to avoid restating prior period financial statements for such errors that are governed by sab if the registrant properly disclosed such errors in its financial statement during the period of adoption 
we adopted this new standard as of december  and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and thus will be adopted during the first quarter of fin provides a two step approach to recognize and measure tax benefits when the benefits realization is uncertain 
the first step is to determine whether the benefit is to be recognized  the second step is to determine the amount to be recognized 
income tax benefits should be recognized when  based on the technical merits of a tax position  the entity believes that if a dispute arose with the taxing authority and were taken to a court of last resort  it is more likely than not ie a probability of greater than percent that the tax position would be sustained as filed 
if a position is determined to be more likely than not of being sustained  the reporting enterprise should recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin upon adoption will be reported as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
we have assessed the effect of the adoption of fin and have concluded that the effect of the adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
overview we are a multi state provider of home health and hospice services

our net proceeds from this offering were approximately million  after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses of approximately million 
we used million of the proceeds to pay in full and terminate the term loan portion of our senior credit facility with wachovia bank  n 
a wachovia 
we plan to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes  including working capital and possible acquisitions 
in conjunction with this event  we expensed million in unamortized deferred financing fees 
on december   we terminated our revolving credit facility with wachovia that consisted of a million revolving credit facility and up to million in letters of credit 
we incurred no penalties as a result of the termination 
as of the date of termination  we had million in letters of credit outstanding and had no amount borrowed against the revolving credit facility 
upon termination of the credit facility  we entered into a separate agreement with wachovia to retain our letters of credit 
in conjunction with this event  we expensed million in unamortized deferred financing fees 
we added home health agencies through a series of acquisitions in we also opened new home health agencies and new hospice agencies 
we refer to the opening of new locations as start ups 
each of the following acquisitions was completed in order to pursue our strategy of achieving market prominence in the southern and southeastern united states by expanding our service base and enhancing our position in certain geographic areas as a leading provider of home health services 
the purchase price of each acquisition was determined based on our analysis of comparable acquisitions and expected cash flows 
goodwill generated from the acquisitions was recognized given the expected contributions of each acquisition to the overall corporate strategy 
each of the acquisitions completed was accounted for as a purchase and is included in our financial statements from the respective acquisition date 
summary of acquisitions on november   we acquired certain assets and certain liabilities of a home health agency in arizona for approximately million
