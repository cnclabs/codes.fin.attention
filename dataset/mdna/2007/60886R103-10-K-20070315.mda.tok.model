risk factors and in part i  item business 
overview background monaco coach corporation the company is a leading manufacturer of premium recreational vehicles including class a  b  and c motor coaches  as well as towable recreational vehicles 
the company also develops and sells luxury motorcoach resort facilities 
these three operations  while closely tied into the recreational lifestyle  are segmented for reporting purposes as the motorized recreational vehicle mrv segment  the towable recreational vehicle trv segment  and the motorhome resort mr segment 
motorized and towable recreational vehicle segment products our products range in suggested retail price from  to  for motor coaches and from  to  for towables 
based upon retail registrations in  we believe we had share of the market for diesel class a motor coaches  a share of the market for gas class a motor coaches  a share of the market for all class a motor coaches  a market for all class c motor coaches  a share of the market for fifth wheel towables and a share of the market for travel trailers 
motorhome resort segment in addition to the manufacturing of premium recreational vehicles  the company also owns and operates two motorhome resort properties the resorts  located in las vegas  nevada  and indio  california 
in addition  the company has acquired a piece of property in la quinta  california  and has a second piece of property in naples  florida under contract for future developments 
the resorts offer sales of individual lots to owners  and also offer a common interest in the amenities at the resort 
lot prices at the two resorts range from  to  amenities at the resorts include club house facilities  tennis  swimming  and golf 
the resorts provide destination locations for premium class a recreational vehicle owners  and help to promote the recreational lifestyle 
business changes we have conducted a series of acquisitions during our history 
beginning in march  we commenced operations by acquiring substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a predecessor company that had been formed in in march  we acquired the holiday rambler division of harley davidson  inc  a manufacturer of a full line of class a motor coaches and towables 
in august  we acquired smc corporation  manufacturer of the beaver and safari brand class a motorhomes 
in november  we acquired from outdoor resorts of america ora three luxury motorcoach resort properties being developed by ora in las vegas  nevada  indio  california  and naples  florida 
in september  we sold the property in naples  florida 
in november of  we acquired r vision  inc  r vision motorized  llc  bison manufacturing  llc  and roadmaster  llc  referred to as r vision  manufacturers of r vision  bison  and roadmaster motorized and towable products 
the r vision acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  through a cash offer on november  all operations of r vision have been incorporated for the period of november  through december  in the consolidated annual financial statements of the company 
during the third quarter of  the company announced the closure of its royale coach operations in elkhart  indiana 
royale coach produced prevost bus conversion motor coaches with price points in excess of million 
royale coach sold approximately coaches per year and was not a significant portion of the company s overall business 
as of the end of  the company had sold all remaining assets of royale coach 
in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  no goodwill amortization has been recorded for any of the company s acquisitions for the years of   or instead  sfas requires annual testing of goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we completed our annual testing of goodwill during the third quarter of as required by sfas and determined that there has been no impairment requiring a write down

results of operations the following table sets forth our results of continuing operations for the fiscal years ended december   and december  dollars in thousands of sales of sales change change net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses plant relocation costs operating income performance in motorized and towable recreational vehicle segments the beginning of began with a temporary upswing in the motorized wholesale markets 
our dealer partners were optimistic that the slow downs in the industry that occurred in were behind them and  accordingly  they increased their orders 
however  as the first quarter came to a close and headed into the second quarter  which is usually the most robust for motorhome sales  it became evident that the retail markets were still lagging wholesale shipments 
as a result  the second half of the year  and particularly the third quarter  were below expectations 
similar to the motorized segment  the towable segment  which had been very strong in  began to show signs of slowing 
the heated pace that was in part fueled by the hurricane season of which resulted in a huge demand for travel trailers  slowed at the beginning of the second quarter 
due to these market constraints  we used this opportunity to focus on aligning our plants and component facilities to meet lower demands  while still optimizing manufacturing facility utilization 
while was challenging on several fronts  we worked aggressively to introduce new and innovative products such as our full slide options on several models  and a new lower priced front end diesel motorized coach 
we also worked with the r vision management team to leverage their expertise in low cost manufacturing processes  and introduced these processes into our legacy towable plants 
the recreational vehicle industry is extremely competitive  and retail customers have many choices available to them 
to distinguish ourselves within the industry  we introduced our franchise for the future fftf program in june of this program is designed to introduce the concept to our dealer partners that our specific brands have intrinsic values as a selling tool 
to support this  and to encourage our dealers to participate in fftf  we worked with outside marketing consultants to develop brand signage  informational computer kiosks  and brand specific displays that are placed within our various independent dealer locations 
in  we followed this up with monaco financial services mfs 
mfs is a branded financing program from general electric commercial distribution finance gecdf and general electric consumer finance gecf 
through mfs  our dealer partners earn rebates from gecdf and gecf for wholesale floorplanning  and retail financing for customers 
we believe that these concepts  along with other features designed to encourage our dealers to focus selling efforts on our various product offerings  will assist them in their sales efforts through the strength of improved brand identity 
motorhome resorts segment while was difficult for the recreational vehicle industry  our motorhome resort properties sales and profits were strong contributors to our operations 
both our properties in las vegas  nevada and indio  california continued to attract new owners  and we anticipate selling through most of the remaining lots in the first half of in addition  we expect to develop two new projects  one in southern california and the other in southern florida during  with lots available at these new resorts sometime late in the fourth quarter of  or early compared with net sales increased from billion in to billion in gross diesel motorized revenues were down  gas motorized revenues were down  and towable revenues were up

prior periods are shown as previously reported as reclassification is impractical 
corporate overhead allocation is comprised of certain shared services such as executive  financial  information systems  legal  and investor relations expenses 
plant relocation costs reflect the costs incurred to relocate the bend  oregon manufacturing operations to the coburg  oregon plant 
we believe this relocation will ultimately result in improved margins for the oregon operations 
operating loss increased as both a percent of sales and in total dollars due to lower gross margins  which was offset by a decrease in s  g  a and corporate overhead allocation as a percent of sales

this increase was due to a shift in the mix of towables produced 
in there was a large amount of fema travel trailer production that carried very little warranty cost associated with their sales 
the overall increase in total dollars associated with warranty costs of million is the result of the increase of sales volumes in compared to decreases in other direct costs in  as a percent of sales  were million 
this decrease was the result of the inclusion of a full year s sales of r vision products which have a lower direct cost structure than our legacy products

the company s capital expenditures were million in  which included costs related to additions of automated machinery in many of its production facilities  upgrades to its information systems infrastructure  and other various capitalized upgrades to existing facilities 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures for all of will be approximately to million  which includes expenditures to purchase additional machinery and equipment in both the company s coburg  oregon and wakarusa  indiana facilities  as well as upgrades to existing information systems infrastructures 
the company may require additional equity or debt financing to address working capital and facilities expansion needs  particularly if the company significantly increases the level of working capital assets such as inventory and accounts receivable 
the company may also from time to time seek to acquire businesses that would complement the company s current business  and any such acquisition could require additional financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available if required or on terms deemed favorable by the company 
as is typical in the recreational vehicle industry  many of the company s retail dealers utilize wholesale floor plan financing arrangements with third party lending institutions to finance their purchases of the company s products 
under the terms of these floor plan arrangements  institutional lenders customarily require the recreational vehicle manufacturer to agree to repurchase any unsold units if the dealer defaults on its credit facility from the lender  subject to certain conditions 
the company has agreements with several institutional lenders under which the company currently has repurchase obligations 
the company s contingent obligations under these repurchase agreements are reduced by the proceeds received upon the sale of any repurchased units 
the company s obligations under these repurchase agreements vary from period to period up to months 
at december   approximately million of products sold by the company to independent dealers were subject to potential repurchase under existing floor plan financing agreements with approximately concentrated with one dealer 
historically  the company has been successful in mitigating losses associated with repurchase obligations 
during  the losses associated with the exercise of repurchase agreements were approximately   and  in and  respectively 
gross repurchase amounts for   and  were million  million  and million  respectively 
dealers for the company undergo credit review prior to becoming a dealer and periodically thereafter 
financial institutions that provide floor plan financing also perform credit reviews and floor checks on an ongoing basis 
we closely monitor sales to dealers that are a higher credit risk 
the repurchase period is limited  usually to a maximum of months 
we believe these activities help to minimize the number of required repurchases 
additionally  the repurchase agreement specifies that the dealer is required to make principal payments during the repurchase period 
since the company repurchases the units based on the schedule of principal payments  the repurchase amount is typically less than the original invoice amount 
this lower repurchase amount helps mitigate our loss when we offer the inventory to another dealer at an amount lower than the original invoice as incentive for the dealer to take the repurchased inventory 
this helps minimize the losses we incur on repurchased inventory

inflation during and to a lesser extent in  we experienced increases in the prices of certain commodity items that we use in the manufacturing of our products 
these include  but are not limited to  steel  copper  aluminum  petroleum  and wood 
while these raw materials are not necessarily indicative of widespread inflationary trends  they had an impact on our production costs 
accordingly  in the second half of we adjusted selling prices to compensate for increases in commodity pricing 
also  due to increases in fuel prices  particularly in  our cost of delivering coaches to our dealers has risen 
accordingly  we have increased our delivery charges subsequent to the end of to offset these rising costs 
while we do not anticipate additional price increases  we may from time to time increase our prices to maintain gross profit margins 
if we should continue to experience adverse trends in these prices it could have a material adverse impact on our business going forward 
see results of operations compared with critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to warranty costs  product liability  and impairment of goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
warranty costs estimated warranty costs are provided for at the time of sale of products with warranties covering the products for up to one year from the date of retail sale five years for the front and sidewall frame structure  and three years on the roadmaster chassis 
these estimates are based on historical average repair costs  as well as other reasonable assumptions as have been deemed appropriate by management 
product liability the company provides an estimate for accrued product liability based on current pending cases  as well as for those cases which are incurred but not reported 
this estimate is developed by legal counsel based on professional judgment  as well as historical experience 
impairment of goodwill the company assesses the potential impairment of goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
this annual test involves management comparing the fair value of each of the company s reporting units  to the respective carrying amounts  including goodwill  of the net book value of the reporting unit  to determine if goodwill has been impaired 
the company uses an estimate of discounted future cash flows to determine fair value for each reporting unit 
inventory allowance the company writes down its inventory for obsolescence  and the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated fair market value 
these write downs are based on assumptions about future sales demand and market conditions 
if actual sales demand or market conditions change from those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes in conjunction with preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company must estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
a discussion of the income tax provision and the components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities can be found in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
repurchase obligations upon request of a lending institution financing a dealer s purchases of the company s product  the company will execute a repurchase agreement 
the company has recorded a liability associated with the disposition of repurchased inventory 
to determine the appropriate liability  the company calculates a reserve  based on an estimate of potential net losses  along with qualitative and quantitative factors  including dealer inventory turn rates  and the financial strength of individual dealers 
new accounting pronouncements fin in june  the board issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes the interpretation 
the interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with fasb  accounting for income taxes by defining a criterion that an individual tax position must be met for any part of the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements

this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are reviewing the provisions of this statement and will adopt it for the fiscal year beginning sab on september  the sec staff issued sab which provides guidance for companies with respect to quantifying financial statement misstatements 
specifically  sab addresses immaterial differences and how they relate to the balance sheet as well as the income statement 
we adopted sab without any impact to the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our borrowings 
we do not currently use rate swaps  futures contracts or options on futures  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
our line of credit permits a combination of fixed and variable interest rate options which allows us to minimize the effect of rising interest rates by locking in fixed rates for periods of up to months 
we believe these features of our credit facilities help us reduce the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations
