item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our business relies on remodeling activity and residential construction 
our results of operations are affected by levels of home improvement and residential construction activity  including repair and remodeling and new construction 
interest rates  energy costs  consumer confidence  national and regional economic conditions  and weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly impact levels of home improvement and residential construction activity 
we have increased our emphasis on new product development in recent years  and continue to focus on organic growth 
consequently  our financial performance will  in part  reflect our success in implementing our growth strategies in our existing markets and in introducing new products 
the loss or a reduction in business from either of our key customers would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the size and importance to the company of the two largest customers is significant 
these customers could effect significant changes in their volume of purchases and could otherwise significantly affect the terms and conditions on which we do business 
our sales to the home depot and lowe s companies were approximately of total company sales for fiscal although builders  dealers  and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for the company s products  an unplanned loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot or lowe s companies could have a material adverse impact on the company 
our operating results are affected by the cost and availability of raw material 
because we are dependent on outside suppliers for our raw material needs  we must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from our suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner 
we have no long term supply contracts with our key suppliers 
a substantial decrease in the availability of products from our suppliers  the loss of key supplier arrangements  or a substantial increase in the cost of our raw materials could adversely impact our results of operations 
we may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of our products in response to inflation and increasing costs 
short term market and competitive pressures may prohibit us from raising prices to offset inflationary raw material and freight costs  which would adversely impact profit margins
