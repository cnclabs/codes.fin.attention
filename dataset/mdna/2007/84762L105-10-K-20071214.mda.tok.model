income taxes 
our effective tax rate on losses from continuing operations is approximately for fiscal our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was approximately for fiscal the primary drivers of the change in our effective tax rate consist of additional tax expense recorded related to an increase in the valuation allowance associated with our us deferred tax assets and the tax impact of the impairment charges recorded in fiscal for certain non deductible goodwill 
as of september   we have us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately and  million  respectively  which will expire between and  and we have foreign net 
table of contents operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which will expire beginning in certain of the foreign net operating losses have indefinite carryforward periods 
as of september  we had us federal  foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and million  respectively  which  at that time  were scheduled to expire between and certain of the foreign net operating losses have indefinite carryforward periods 
limitations apply to a portion of these net operating loss carryforwards in accordance with internal revenue code section the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions 
we establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate it is more likely than not that the tax assets will not be realized 
we base these estimates on projections of future income  including tax planning strategies  in certain jurisdictions 
changes in industry conditions and other economic conditions may impact our ability to project future income 
sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas requires the establishment of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in accordance with sfas  we periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized and determine if adjustments to the valuation allowance are appropriate 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded an approximately million non cash deferred income tax charge related to a valuation allowance against us net deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  we recorded a non cash deferred income tax charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to an increase in the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in mexico 
in addition to these valuation allowances  we have also recorded valuation allowances  primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards  in brazil  argentina  chile and canada 
our total valuation allowance  established for the tax benefit of deferred tax assets that may not be realized  is approximately million at september  of this amount  approximately million relates to us net deferred tax assets and approximately million relates to foreign net deferred tax assets 
sfas requires companies to test goodwill and indefinite lived assets for impairment annually  or more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
during fiscal and  the company recorded non cash pretax impairment charges of approximately million and million  respectively 
the tax impact  prior to consideration of the current year valuation allowance  of the impairment charges was limited to a deferred tax benefit of approximately million and million respectively  because a significant portion of the impaired assets are not deductible for tax purposes 
discontinued operations

fiscal reflects a loss from discontinued operations of approximately million  net of tax  which includes a non cash pretax charge of million to reduce the carrying value of certain assets  principally consisting of goodwill and intangible assets  related to the home and garden business in order to reflect the estimated fair value of this business 
such estimated fair value was based on a range of estimated sales values  taking into account current market conditions provided by independent third party advisors 
if and when a sale is consummated the actual fair value at that time may vary from the estimated fair value reflected herein 
net sales related to discontinued operations totaled million in fiscal our fiscal loss from discontinued operations includes an income tax benefit of million  which includes a million non cash deferred income tax charge related to increasing the valuation allowance against us deferred tax assets related to our home and garden business  coupled with an income tax benefit of million  which was recorded in connection with the non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of certain assets  principally goodwill and intangible assets related to the home and garden business

businesses acquired in fiscal contributed million to net sales during the months these businesses were included in fiscal but not included in fiscal net sales 
the following table details the principal components of the change in net sales from fiscal to fisca in millions net sales fiscal net sales impact of united acquisition from october january impact of tetra acquisition from october april impact of jungle labs acquisition from october august increase in pet products sales  excluding impact of tetra  united and jungle labs acquisitions decline in global batteries personal care remington branded product sales decline in global batteries personal care battery sales foreign currency impact  net other  net fiscal net sales 
table of contents consolidated net sales by product line for fiscal and fiscal are as follows in millions fiscal year product line net sales consumer batteries pet supplies electric shaving and grooming electric personal care portable lighting total net sales to external customers segment net sales to external customers in fiscal increased to  million from  million during fiscal consumer battery sales for fiscal were down to million when compared to fiscal sales of million 
the decline in consolidated consumer battery sales was due primarily to an million decline in europe row battery sales and an million decline in north america alkaline battery sales 
europe row battery sales declined in fiscal as we experienced a product mix shift from branded batteries to lower priced private label batteries and exited some low margin private label alkaline business 
in addition  in fiscal european consumers began to shift their purchasing habits from high end electronic specialty stores and photo stores  where we enjoy strong market shares  to deep discount and food retail channels where we do not have as strong a presence 
the decline in our north america alkaline battery sales was driven by a number of factors  but primarily due to a reduction of inventory levels at certain retailers in north america  lost distribution and the completion of our transition to a new alkaline marketing strategy in north america  centered around an improved value position  which took longer than anticipated 
our previous alkaline marketing strategy of more focused on the cost of our product to the customer while our current alkaline marketing strategy  which was introduced in fiscal  same performance  better price  was designed to highlight the fact that battery performance tests show that our alkaline batteries perform as well as the leading alkaline battery brands and are offered at better prices 
we experienced decreased battery sales as a result of the change in packaging and pricing from the more strategy to the same performance  better price strategy as customers and consumers adjusted to the new message and the related changes in our pricing and package sizes 
during this transition  some of the existing inventories of more alkaline battery products were heavily promoted to sell and others were sold to discounters at prices lower than the prices we would have typically received in the marketplace 
the decline in consolidated electric shaving and grooming sales was primarily attributable to a million decline in north america sales driven by lower than expected sales of remington men s shaving products  primarily during the father s day holiday and christmas holiday 
these declines were partly offset by a million increase in sales of remington branded products in latin america as we continued the introduction of remington branded products throughout that region 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the north american consumer battery business showed some signs of improvement 
fourth quarter fiscal battery sales in north america increased by approximately over the prior year s fourth quarter due primarily to the non reoccurrence of certain retailer inventory reductions which began in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we benefited from strong customer acceptance of our new rayovac marketing campaign referenced above 
gross profit 
gross profit margin for fiscal decreased slightly to compared to our fiscal gross profit margin of 
our fiscal gross profit margin was impacted by approximately million of restructuring and related charges  primarily related to a series of initiatives in europe to reduce operating costs and rationalize our manufacturing structure as well as the costs associated with our integration of united and tetra 
our fiscal gross margin was impacted by charges recognized in cost of goods sold related to inventory acquired as part of the tetra and united acquisitions 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  this inventory was revalued as part of the purchase price allocation 

table of contents for fiscal  this accounting treatment resulted in an increase in acquired inventory of million and million for tetra and united  respectively 
these inventory valuation adjustments were non cash charges 
we also incurred approximately million of restructuring and related charges during fiscal related to the closing of a zinc carbon manufacturing facility in breitenbach  france 
see restructuring and related charges below as well as note  restructuring and related charges  of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional information regarding our restructuring and related charges 
in addition to the items discussed above  our gross profit margin in fiscal included a seven month benefit from higher margin tetra pet product sales during the comparable months not owned in fiscal this benefit  however  was more than offset by declines in gross margins on our consumer battery  electric shaving and grooming and electric personal care products 
the decline in consumer battery gross margins was driven by higher raw material costs  primarily zinc  reduced utilization of our manufacturing facilities due to volume declines and the previously mentioned shift in european product mix and distribution channels 
higher prices of zinc negatively impacted fiscal gross profit by approximately million 
electric shaving and grooming and electric personal care margins declined primarily as a result of consumers purchasing lower margin products 
operating loss income 
an operating loss of approximately million was recognized in fiscal as compared to operating income in fiscal of million 
the fiscal operating loss is directly attributable to a non cash pretax impairment charge of approximately million for certain trade name intangible assets and goodwill written down to fair value in accordance with sfas see goodwill and intangibles impairment below for further details on this impairment charge

see restructuring and related charges below as well as note  restructuring and related charges  of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional information regarding our restructuring and related charges 
in addition to the items discussed above  operating expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal increased due to increased distribution costs which totaled approximately million  or of sales  in fiscal versus million  or of sales  in the prior year 
fiscal distribution costs were well above historical levels as we incurred increased fuel costs and above normal shipping and delivery costs in north america in our global batteries personal care and global pet supplies segment during the peak selling season to meet customer needs 
all other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal were in line with fiscal percentages

consumer battery sales for fiscal were down to million when compared to fiscal sales of million 
the decline in consolidated consumer battery sales was due primarily to an million decline in europe row battery sales and an million decline in north america alkaline battery sales 
the entire million decline in europe row battery sales occurred in continental europe as a result of i our decision to exit certain low margin private label alkaline battery businesses  ii a shift in european distribution channels from electronic specialty stores and photo stores  where we enjoy strong market shares  to deep discount and food retail channels where we have not established as strong a presence  and iii a shift in product mix due to consumer preferences for lower priced private label batteries 
the decline in our north america alkaline battery sales was driven by a number of factors  primarily a reduction of inventory levels at certain retailers in north america  lost distribution and the completion of our transition to a new alkaline marketing strategy in north america centered around an improved value position  as described above  which took longer than anticipated 
consolidated electric shaving and grooming sales were also down in fiscal as compared to fiscal the sales decline was primarily attributable to a million decline in north america sales  which was driven by lower than expected sales of remington men s shaving products  primarily during the father s day holiday and christmas holiday

if any other event of default under the indenture occurs and is continuing  the trustee  or the registered holders of at least in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding new notes  may declare the acceleration of the amounts due under the new notes 
we were in compliance with all covenants associated with our million principal amount of new notes  our million principal amount of existing notes that remain outstanding and our million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due collectively referred to as the senior subordinated notes  with the exception of the fixed charge coverage ratio test relating to the indebtedness under the senior subordinated notes  that were in effect as of and during the fiscal year ended september  due to significant restructuring charges and reduced business performance  we have not met the minimum requirement of for the fixed charge coverage ratio test under the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes 
until we 
table of contents satisfy such test  we are limited in our ability to make significant acquisitions or incur significant additional senior debt beyond our senior credit facilities 
we do not expect our inability to meet the fixed charge coverage ratio test to impair our ability to provide adequate liquidity to meet the short term and long term liquidity requirements of our existing businesses  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
equity financing activities 
during fiscal  we granted approximately million shares of restricted stock 
of these grants  approximately million shares are time based and vest on a pro rata basis over a three year period and million shares are performance based and vest upon achievement of certain performance goals 
all vesting dates are subject to the recipient s continued employment with us 
the total market value of the restricted shares on the date of grant was approximately million which has been recorded as unearned restricted stock compensation 
unearned compensation is amortized to expense over the appropriate vesting period 
during fiscal  we also issued a minimal number of shares of common stock associated with the exercise of stock options with an aggregate cash exercise value of approximately million

we believe the following accounting policies are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
the application of these policies requires management s judgment and estimates in areas that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of assets and asset impairment we evaluate certain long lived assets to be held and used  such as property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets for impairment based on the expected future cash flows or earnings projections associated with such assets 
impairment reviews are conducted at the judgment of management when it believes that a change in circumstances in the business or external factors warrants a review 
circumstances such as the discontinuation of a product or product line  a sudden or consistent decline in the sales forecast for a product  changes in technology or in the way an asset is being used  a history of operating or cash flow losses or an adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  among others  may trigger an impairment review 
an asset s value is deemed impaired if the discounted cash flows or earnings projections generated do not substantiate the carrying value of the asset 
the estimation of such amounts requires management s judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital and selection of an appropriate discount rate  as applicable 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease discounted future operating cash flows or earnings projections and could  therefore  change impairment determinations 
sfas requires companies to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
in fiscal and  we  with the assistance of independent third party valuation specialists  tested our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
as a result of this testing  we recorded a non cash pretax impairment charge of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the million impairment charge incurred in fiscal reflects goodwill associated with our north america reporting unit  which is part of our global batteries personal care reportable segment  coupled with an impairment of trade name intangible assets primarily associated with our global batteries personal care reportable segment 
the million non cash pretax impairment charge incurred in fiscal reflects impaired goodwill of million of which million relates to our global pet supplies reportable segment and million relates to our latin america reporting unit  which is included as part of our global batteries personal care reportable segment 
the remaining charge of million relates to impaired trade name intangible assets of which million is associated with our global pet supplies business segment and million is associated with our latin america and europe row reporting units  both of which are part of our global batteries personal care reportable segment 
future cash expenditures will not result from these impairment charges 
there were no impairment charges recognized in fiscal as a result of our testing 

table of contents we used a discounted estimated future cash flows methodology to determine the fair value of our reporting units goodwill 
fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets  which represent trade names  was determined using a relief from royalty methodology 
assumptions critical to our fair value estimates were i the present value factors used in determining the fair value of the reporting units and trade names or third party indicated fair values for assets expected to be disposed  ii royalty rates used in our trade name valuations  iii projected average revenue growth rates used in the reporting unit and trade name models  and iv projected long term growth rates used in the derivation of terminal year values 
we also tested fair value for reasonableness by comparison to the market capitalization of the company 
these and other assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and expectations of management and will change in the future based on period specific facts and circumstances 
as previously discussed  we have designated our home and garden business as discontinued operations 
in accordance with sfas  long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
during fiscal  we recorded a non cash pretax charge of million in discontinued operations to reduce the carrying value of certain assets  principally consisting of goodwill and intangible assets  related to the home and garden business in order to reflect the estimated fair value of this business 
such estimated fair value was based on a range of estimated sales values  taking into account current market conditions  provided by independent third party advisors 
if and when a sale is consummated the actual fair value at that time may vary from the estimated fair value reflected herein 
in accordance with sfas  we establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate it is more likely than not that the tax assets will not be realized 
we base these estimates on projections of future income  including tax planning strategies  by individual tax jurisdictions 
changes in industry and economic conditions and the competitive environment may impact the accuracy of our projections 
in accordance with sfas  during each reporting period we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized and determine if adjustments to the valuation allowance are appropriate 
as a result of this assessment  during fiscal and fiscal we recorded a non cash deferred income tax charge of approximately million and million  respectively  related to increasing the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets

revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk we recognize revenue from product sales generally upon delivery to the customer or the shipping point in situations where the customer picks up the product or where delivery terms so stipulate 
this represents the point at which title and all risks and rewards of ownership of the product are passed  provided that there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is deemed reasonably assured 
we are generally not obligated to allow for  and our general policy is not to accept  product returns for battery sales 
we do accept returns in specific instances related to our electric shaving and grooming  electric personal care  lawn and garden  household insect control and pet supply products 
the provision for customer returns is based on historical sales and returns and other relevant information 
we estimate and accrue the cost of returns  which are treated as a reduction of net sales 
we enter into various promotional arrangements  primarily with retail customers  including arrangements entitling such retailers to cash rebates from us based on the level of their purchases  which require us to estimate and accrue the costs of the promotional programs 
these costs are generally treated as a reduction of net sales 

table of contents we also enter into promotional arrangements that target the ultimate consumer 
such arrangements are treated as either a reduction of net sales or an increase in cost of sales  based on the type of promotional program 
the income statement presentation of our promotional arrangements complies with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
cash consideration  or an equivalent thereto  given to a customer is generally classified as a reduction of net sales 
if we provide a customer anything other than cash  the cost of the consideration is classified as an expense and included in cost of sales 
for all types of promotional arrangements and programs  we monitor our commitments and use statistical measures and past experience to determine the amounts to be recorded for the estimate of the earned  but unpaid  promotional costs 
the terms of our customer related promotional arrangements and programs are tailored to each customer and are generally documented through written contracts  correspondence or other communications with the individual customers 
we also enter into various arrangements  primarily with retail customers  which require us to make an upfront cash  or slotting payment  to secure the right to distribute through such customer 
we capitalize slotting payments  provided the payments are supported by a time or volume based arrangement with the retailer  and amortize the associated payment over the appropriate time or volume based term of the arrangement 
the amortization of slotting payments is treated as a reduction in net sales and a corresponding asset is reported in deferred charges and other in our consolidated balance sheets included in this annual report on form k 
our trade receivables subject us to credit risk which is evaluated based on changing economic  political and specific customer conditions 
we assess these risks and make provisions for collectibility based on our best estimate of the risks presented and information available at the date of the financial statements 
the use of different assumptions may change our estimate of collectibility 
we extend credit to our customers based upon an evaluation of the customer s financial condition and credit history and generally do not require collateral 
our credit terms generally range between and days from invoice date  depending upon the evaluation of the customer s financial condition and history 
we monitor our customers credit and financial conditions in order to assess whether the economic conditions have changed and adjust our credit policies with respect to any individual customer as we determine appropriate 
these adjustments may include  but are not limited to  restricting shipments to customers  reducing credit limits  shortening credit terms  requiring cash payments in advance of shipment or securing credit insurance

pensions our accounting for pension benefits is primarily based on discount rate  expected and actual return on plan assets and other assumptions made by management  and is impacted by outside factors such as equity and fixed income market performance 
pension liability is principally the estimated present value of future benefits  net of plan assets 
in calculating the estimated present value of future benefits  net of plan assets  for both fiscal and  we used discount rates of to in fiscal and to in fiscal in adjusting the discount rates from fiscal to  we considered the change in the general market interest rates of debt and solicited the advice of our actuary 
we believe the discount rates used is reflective of the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
pension expense is principally the sum of interest and service cost of the plan  less the expected return on plan assets and the amortization of the difference between our assumptions and actual experience 
the expected 
table of contents return on plan assets is calculated by applying an assumed rate of return to the fair value of plan assets 
we used expected returns on plan assets of to in fiscal and to in fiscal based on the advice of our independent actuary  we believe the expected rates of return are reflective of the long term average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested 
if such expected returns were overstated  it would ultimately increase future pension expense 
similarly  an understatement of the expected return would ultimately decrease future pension expense 
if plan assets decline due to poor performance by the markets and or interest rate declines our pension liability will increase  ultimately increasing future pension expense

restructuring and related charges restructuring charges are recognized and measured according to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
under sfas  restructuring charges include  but are not limited to  termination and related costs consisting primarily of severance costs and retention bonuses  and contract termination costs consisting primarily of lease termination costs 
related charges  as defined by us  include  but are not limited to  other costs directly associated with exit and integration activities  including impairment of property and other assets  departmental costs of full time incremental integration employees  and any other items related to the exit or integration activities 
costs for such activities are estimated by us after evaluating detailed analyses of the cost to be incurred 
we present restructuring and related charges on a combined basis 
liabilities from restructuring and related charges are recorded for estimated costs of facility closures  significant organizational adjustment and measures undertaken by management to exit certain activities 
costs for such activities are estimated by management after evaluating detailed analyses of the cost to be incurred 
such liabilities could include amounts for items such as severance costs and related benefits including settlements of pension plans  impairment of property and equipment and other current or long term assets  lease termination payments and any other items directly related to the exit activities 
while the actions are carried out as expeditiously as possible  restructuring and related charges are estimates 
changes in estimates resulting in an increase to or a reversal of a previously recorded liability may be required as management executes a restructuring plan 
we report restructuring and related charges associated with manufacturing and related initiatives in cost of goods sold 
restructuring and related charges reflected in cost of goods sold include  but are not limited to  termination and related costs associated with manufacturing employees  asset impairments relating to manufacturing initiatives and other costs directly related to the restructuring initiatives implemented 
we report restructuring and related charges associated with administrative functions in operating expenses  such as initiatives impacting sales  marketing  distribution or other non manufacturing related functions 
restructuring and related charges reflected in operating expenses include  but are not limited to  termination and related costs  any asset impairments relating to the administrative functions and other costs directly related to the initiatives implemented

loss contingencies loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the outcome of existing litigation  the impact of environmental matters and pending or potential examinations by various taxing authorities are examples of situations evaluated as loss contingencies 
estimating the probability and magnitude of losses is often dependent upon management s judgment of potential actions by third parties and regulators

recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the fasb believes sfas also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
under sfas  fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
in sfas  the fasb clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  for example  the reporting entity s own data 
under sfas  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
the provisions of sfas for financial assets and liabilities  as well as any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in financial statements  are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the fasb did  however  provide a one year deferral for the implementation of sfas for other non financial assets 
earlier application is encouraged  provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial 
table of contents statements for that fiscal year  including any financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas will have on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin is a two step process 
the first step is recognition  whereby the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  the enterprise should presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is permitted as long as the enterprise has not yet issued financial statements  including interim financial statements  in the period of adoption 
the provisions of fin are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of this standard 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of fin the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin should be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or other appropriate components of equity or net assets in the statement of financial position for that fiscal year 
the company is required to adopt fin in the first quarter of fiscal and does not believe such adoption will have a material effect on its financial condition  results of operation or cash flows 
in june  the eitf issued eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation  eitf to clarify diversity in practice on the presentation of different types of taxes in the financial statements 
the eitf concluded that  for taxes within the scope of the issue  a company may adopt a policy of presenting taxes either gross within revenue or net 
that is  it may include charges to customers for taxes within revenues and the charge for the taxes from the taxing authority within cost of sales  or  alternatively  it may net the charge to the customer and the charge from the taxing authority 
if taxes are reported on a gross basis  and are significant  an entity should disclose the amounts of those taxes subject to eitf the guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we currently record our sales net of any value added or sales tax 
accordingly  the adoption of eitf will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors we have market risk exposure from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we use derivative financial instruments for purposes other than trading to mitigate the risk from such exposures 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note r  significant accounting policies and practices derivative financial instruments  of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 

table of contents interest rate risk we have bank lines of credit at variable interest rates 
the general level of us interest rates  libor and euro libor affect interest expense 
we use interest rate swaps to manage such risk 
the net amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swap agreements are accrued as interest rates change  and are recognized over the life of the swap agreements as an adjustment to interest expense from the underlying debt to which the swap is designated 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the contract counter parties are included in accrued liabilities or accounts receivable 
foreign exchange risk we are subject to risk from sales and loans to and from our subsidiaries as well as sales to  purchases from and bank lines of credit with  third party customers  suppliers and creditors  respectively  denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign currency sales and purchases are made primarily in euro  pounds sterling  brazilian reals and canadian dollars 
we manage our foreign exchange exposure from anticipated sales  accounts receivable  intercompany loans  firm purchase commitments  accounts payable and credit obligations through the use of naturally occurring offsetting positions borrowing in local currency  forward foreign exchange contracts  foreign exchange rate swaps and foreign exchange options 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the contract counter parties are included in accounts payable or accounts receivable 
commodity price risk we are exposed to fluctuations in market prices for purchases of zinc  urea and di ammonium phosphates used in the manufacturing process 
we use commodity swaps  calls and puts to manage such risk 
the maturity of  and the quantities covered by  the contracts are closely correlated to our anticipated purchases of the commodities 
the cost of calls  and the premiums received from the puts  are amortized over the life of the contracts and are recorded in cost of goods sold  along with the effects of the swap  put and call contracts 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the counter parties are included in accounts payable or accounts receivable 
sensitivity analysis the analysis below is hypothetical and should not be considered a projection of future risks
