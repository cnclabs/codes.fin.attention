item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  for information on the composition of bankunited s loan portfolio by type of loan  including mortgage loans held for sale  at the end of each of the five past fiscal years  and for information on asset quality 
one to four family residential mortgage lending includes residential mortgages and specialty consumer mortgages 
we originate both fixed and adjustable rate arms residential loans secured by first mortgages for our own loan portfolio and for sale in the secondary market to government sponsored entities and other investors 
residential loans are originated through locations consisting of neighborhood banking offices and two loan production offices located in florida as well as seven loan production offices located in other states 
the origination channels we use include a network of mortgage brokers  internal retail loan originators  and the sales staff at each banking and loan production office 
this wide origination network allows us to generate a continuous flow of residential loans for our portfolio and for sale in the secondary market 
the neighborhood banking offices offer specialty consumer mortgage loans  which provide our customers the convenience of an accelerated application  review and approval process 
these offices also offer additional products and services to loan customers 
first mortgage loans generally have contractual maturities between and years 
however  residential loans typically remain outstanding for shorter periods than their contractual maturities because borrowers prepay the loans in full upon the sale of the mortgaged property or upon refinancing of the original loan 
interest rates may be fixed or variable and a wide array of mortgage products is offered to the consumer 
for the fiscal years ended september    and  first mortgage residential loans  including specialty consumer mortgages  represented   and  respectively  of the total loan portfolio 
interest income from these loans  including amortization of deferred fees and costs  represented   and  respectively  of total interest income and fees on loans 
the average loan size in our residential loan portfolio at september  was  and the average loan to value ratio of the residential loan portfolio was at inception when adjusted for coverage provided by private mortgage insurance and the average credit score is payment option loans payment option products provide borrowers with payment options  which could change the amount of interest collected on a monthly basis and may increase the outstanding balance of the loan 
growth in the residential loan portfolio during the past three years has been centered in payment option loans 
payment option products may have an interest rate that adjusts periodically  generally on a monthly basis  and require a minimum monthly loan payment that adjusts annually 
borrowers have the ability to pay a minimum payment that may not cover interest accrued on the loan for the month and this would result in deferred interest being added to the loan balance 
this is generally referred to as negative amortization 

table of contents alternatively  the borrower has the option to pay the full amount of interest due if higher than the minimum payment or another amount above the minimum payment that would cover interest and reduce the outstanding balance of the loan 
contractual terms of the payment option loans limit the amount that the loan balance may increase to of the original loan balance 
at the earlier of five years or upon reaching the maximum level of negative amortization the loan must be repaid on a fully amortizing basis over the remaining term 
payment requirements at that point may result in higher payments for the remaining life of the loan 
our underwriting is performed internally and aims to limit risk by qualifying the borrowers by analyzing their ability to make a fully amortizing repayment at the fully indexed loan rate not allowing financing of the down payment through other loans at bankunited requiring mortgage insurance mi on loans where the loan to value exceeds without the insurance utilizing in house appraisers to review external appraisals 
the majority of our payment option loan originations during the second half of fiscal was in the form of three and five year fixed rate loans  which adjust after the initial fixed rate period 
generally  these loans carry approximately a pay rate of to  which allows for a rate of negative amortization that is currently less than that of a monthly payment option loan 
these loans comprised of our payment option balances as of september  consumer lending 
consumer loans are originated through our branch network in the form of home equity loans and lines of credit  and to a lesser extent  automobile  boat  and cash collateral loans 
home equity lines of credit are made with adjustable rates indexed to the prime rate  and generally have maturities of ten years or less 
home equity loans are fixed rate loans with maturities up to years 
automobile  boat  and cash collateral loans are offered on a fixed rate basis 
commercial real estate and multi family lending 
bankunited originates and participates in commercial real estate loans  and to a lesser degree  multi family loans  which may have fixed or variable interest rates 
our commercial real estate strategy is to increase originations by developing long term relationships with businesses  real estate developers  investors  and other professionals in the real estate market 
the commercial real estate loan portfolio includes loans secured by industrial warehouses  retail centers  apartment buildings  office buildings  and other properties located primarily in our market area 
real estate construction lending 
we make real estate construction loans to builders and real estate developers for the construction of commercial and single and multi family real estate 
these loans are secured by primarily single family homes  condominiums  apartments  retail centers  commercial warehouse properties  office buildings  medical facilities or other property 
the loans generally provide for the payment of interest and loan fees from loan proceeds and are underwritten to the same standards as commercial real estate loans 
because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs and the market for the project upon completion  it is often difficult to determine the total loan funds that will be required to complete a project  the related loan to value ratios and the likelihood of a project s ultimate success 
we are sensitive to trends that may increase risk for certain projects and takes precautionary measures when considering loans related to condominium developments in certain segments of the florida market 
land 
we make land loans to individuals for the purchase of land for their residences  as well as to builders and real estate developers for the purchase of land slated for future development 
the bank generally requires that the properties securing land loans to be developed within to months and these loans generally have a lower loan to value ratio than other commercial real estate loans 
the majority of our land loans are secured by property located in southeastern florida 

table of contents commercial lending 
we make and participate in both secured and unsecured commercial business loans to companies in our market area 
the strategy for commercial lending focuses on forming and maintaining customer relationships with primarily middle market companies doing business in florida  but also places significant attention on small businesses 
the majority of our commercial business loan portfolio is secured by accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  and or general corporate assets of the borrowers  as well as the personal guarantee of the principal 
we also make and participate in loans originated by third parties 
commercial loans may have fixed or variable interest rates and are typically originated for maturities ranging from one to five years 
commercial loans are generally made for shorter maturities and may involve a higher level of risk because of the difficulty in liquidating the underlying collateral  if any  in the event of default 
mortgage loan servicing we sell a portion of the mortgage loans that we originate and in some cases may retain the right to service those loans 
at september   and  we were servicing loans of approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  for others 
as of september   and  bankunited had mortgage servicing rights with a carrying value of million  million and million  respectively 
the majority of loans sold in fiscal year were sold on a servicing released basis 
mortgage servicing rights msr arise from contractual agreements between bankunited and investors in mortgage securities and mortgage loans 
under these contracts  we perform loan servicing functions in exchange for fees and other remuneration 
we recognize msr as assets upon the sale of loans that continue to be serviced by us 
the value of msr assets is derived from future revenues from contractually specified servicing fees  late charges  and other ancillary revenues that are expected to be more than adequate compensation to cover the costs associated with performing the service  and are generally expressed as a percent of the unpaid principal balance 
the servicing functions typically performed include collecting and remitting loan payments  responding to borrower inquiries  accounting for principal and interest  holding custodial funds for payment of property taxes and insurance premiums  and generally administering the loans 
the servicing fees paid to us are collected from the monthly payments made by the mortgagors 
in addition to fees paid for servicing the loans  we receive other ancillary servicing fees such as late charges and prepayment fees 
investments and mortgage backed securities we maintain an investment portfolio consisting of debt and equity instruments including mortgage backed securities of fnma and fhlmc  trust preferred obligations  mortgage backed securities of private issuers and municipal obligations 
federal regulations limit the instruments in which we may invest our funds 
our current investment policy permits us to acquire securities which are rated primarily investment grade by a nationally recognized rating agency 
the majority of our investment portfolio consists of mortgage backed securities which are primarily acquired for their liquidity  yield  and credit characteristics 
such securities may be used as collateral for borrowing or pledged as collateral for certain deposits  including public funds deposits 
mortgage backed securities may be fixed or adjustable rate and include collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage pass through certificates 
we acquire mortgage backed securities through direct purchases  as proceeds for loans sales to fnma and fhlmc  or through securitization of its own loans

insurance of deposit accounts 
the bank is chartered by the ots and deposits are insured by the savings association insurance fund saif and the bank insurance fund bif 
deposits are insured up to  for each insured account holder  subject to applicable terms and conditions 
the fdic may terminate deposit insurance or impose sanctions if it finds that an institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices  cannot continue operations because it is in an unsafe and unsound condition  or has violated regulatory requirements 
the bank s management does not know of any present condition pursuant to which the fdic would seek to impose sanctions on the bank or terminate insurance of its deposits 
the fdic uses a risk based premium system to assess insurance premiums based upon an institutions level of capital and supervisory evaluation 
institutions  which the fdic considers well capitalized and financially sound pay the lowest premiums  while institutions that are less than adequately capitalized and of substantial supervisory concern pay the highest premiums 
during  assessment rates for insured institutions ranged from of insured deposits for well capitalized institutions with minor supervisory concerns to of insured deposits for undercapitalized institutions with substantial supervisory concerns 
the federal deposit insurance reform act of fdira and the federal deposit insurance reform conforming amendments act of revised the laws governing federal deposit insurance and provided the fdic with more discretion in managing deposit insurance assessments 
insurance premiums are based on a number of factors including the risk of loss that insured institutions pose to the deposit insurance fund 
under this risk based system  the fdic will evaluate an institution s risk based on supervisory ratings for all insured institutions  financial ratios for most institutions  and long term debt issuer ratings for certain large institutions 
the pricing structure for sets rates with the minimum premium starting at 
of insured deposits 
certain credits were allowed against premiums for certain eligible institutions with premium assessments prior to management expects premium cost to be between 
and 
for the remainder of calendar reduced by applicable costs

as such  the bank started accruing for fdic deposit insurance premium in january the total expense for insurance premium for the nine months starting january and ending september amounted to  partially offset by the credit mentioned below 
the fdira provided for a one time assessment credit otac to eligible institutions with premium assessments prior to a one time assessment credit of  was awarded to the bank in fiscal year credits could not be used to offset the fico assessments  but were applied as a subtraction deduction from the quarterly fdic deposit insurance charge 
as a result  a  credit was applied to the fdic deposit insurance third fiscal quarter offsetting the deposit insurance balance due in full 
the remaining  credit was applied to the fourth fiscal quarter s deposit insurance charge 
regulatory capital requirements 
ots regulations incorporate a risk based capital requirement that is designed to be at least as stringent as the capital standard applicable to national banks and that is similar to fdic 
table of contents requirements 
associations whose exposure to interest rate risk is deemed to be above normal must deduct a portion of such exposure in calculating their risk based capital 
as of september   the bank met all applicable regulatory requirements 
see note regulatory capital to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
there are currently no regulatory capital requirements directly applicable to holding companies 
regulators have also established capital levels for institutions to implement the prompt corrective action provisions of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia 
insured institutions are categorized under the following levels well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
an institution s category depends upon its capital levels in relation to relevant capital measures  which include a risk based capital measure  a leverage ratio capital measure  and certain other factors 
a well capitalized institution must have a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a ratio of capital to risk weighted assets tier risk based capital ratio of or more and a ratio of capital to adjusted total assets tier leverage ratio of or more  and may not be subject to any written agreement order capital directive  or prompt corrective action directive issued by the ots 
an institution will be categorized as adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a tier risk based capital ratio of or more  and either a tier leverage ratio of or more or a tier leverage ratio of or more  if the institution is assigned a composite rating of the composite rating is the numeric rating assigned by the ots under its rating system  as a result of the most recent ots examination 
any institution that is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized will be considered undercapitalized 
the ots would be required to take prompt corrective action to resolve the bank s situation if the bank failed to satisfy these minimum capital requirements 
at september   the bank was a well capitalized institution under the definitions as adopted 
risk based capital guidelines take into account various factors  including concentration of credit risk  risks associated with nontraditional activities  and the actual performance and expected risk of loss of multi family mortgages 
ots regulations include an interest rate risk component to the risk based capital requirements for savings associations such as the bank 
management monitors interest rate risk based on the ots s and bankunited s standards  and believes that the effect of including such an interest rate risk component in the calculation of risk adjusted capital will not cause the bank to cease being well capitalized 
the fdic also requires the ots to review its capital standards every two years to ensure that its standards require sufficient capital to facilitate prompt corrective action and to minimize loss to the saif and the bif 
restrictions on dividends and other capital distributions 
the bank must provide the ots with at least days written notice before declaring any dividend or approving any capital distribution 
the ots may object to any distribution on safety and soundness grounds and prior approval  instead of notice  may be required in some cases

the guidance discusses the importance of ensuring that loan terms and underwriting standards are consistent with prudent lending practices  including consideration of a borrower s repayment capacity 
the guidance also suggests that banks i implement strong risk management standards  ii maintain capital levels commensurate with the risk and iii establish an allowance for loan and lease losses that reflects the collectability of the portfolio 
the guidance urges banks to ensure that consumers have sufficient information to clearly understand loan terms and associated risks prior to making a product or payment choice

table of contents item a 
risk factors the continuation of current market conditions could adversely impact our business 
in fiscal a combination of rising interest rates and softening real estate prices throughout the united states culminated in an industry wide increase in borrowers unable to make their mortgage payments and increased foreclosure rates 
lenders in certain sections of the housing and mortgage markets were forced to close or limit their operations 
in response  financial institutions have tightened their underwriting standards  limiting the availability of sources of credit and liquidity 
these conditions have already directly impacted the demand for our products by customers and by secondary market participants 
if these negative market conditions become more widespread or continue for a prolonged period our earnings and capital could be negatively impacted 
in response  we have shifted from primarily originating monthly payment option products to select my payment loans and conforming agency loans 
additionally  we are transitioning to selling more loans into the secondary market and maintaining a smaller portion of our production in portfolio 
our business may be adversely influenced if the markets do not accept our new products on a similar scale to our traditional offerings 
changes in economic conditions could cause an increase in delinquencies and non performing assets  including loan charge offs  and depress our income and growth 
our loan portfolios include many real estate secured loans  demand for which may decrease during economic downturns as a result of  among other things  an increase in unemployment  a decrease in real estate values  a slowdown in housing price appreciation or increases in interest rates 
these factors could depress our earnings and consequently our financial condition because customers may not want or need our products and services  borrowers may not be able to repay their loans  the value of the collateral securing our loans to borrowers may decline  and the quality of our loan portfolio may decline 
any of the latter four scenarios could cause an increase in delinquencies and non performing assets or require us to charge off a percentage of our loans and or increase our provision for loan losses  which would reduce our income 
in order to limit our credit risk  certain of our loans require borrowers to purchase credit enhancements such as private mortgage insurance 
fraud or misrepresentation could result in the denial of our mortgage insurance claim  which could increase our potential loss on a property 
repeated denials of claims or the financial failure of one of our mortgage insurance providers could have a negative affect on our earnings 
an inadequate allowance for loan losses would reduce our earnings 
we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans will not be sufficient to assure full repayment 
credit losses are inherent in the lending business and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our ability to meet our obligations 
volatility and deterioration in domestic and foreign economies may also increase our risk for credit losses 
our portfolio composition  as of september   of which approximately of loans are primarily secured by real estate  tends to reduce loss exposure 
we evaluate the collectibility of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate based upon such factors as the risk characteristics of various classifications of loans  previous loan loss experience  specific loans that have loss potential  
table of contents delinquency trends  estimated fair market value of the collateral  current economic conditions  the views of our regulators  and geographic and industry loan concentrations 
if our evaluation is incorrect and borrower defaults cause losses exceeding our allowance for loan losses  our earnings could be significantly and adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that our allowance will be adequate to cover loan losses inherent in our portfolio 
we may experience losses in our loan portfolios or perceive adverse trends that require us to significantly increase our allowance for loan losses in the future  which would also reduce our earnings 
during the quarter ended september   we experienced elevated levels of nonperforming assets and correspondingly recorded an increase to the allowance 
if nonperforming assets were to remain elevated we would need to maintain a higher allowance which would reduce our earnings 
reduced demand for our loans in the secondary market could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
historically  we have held our loan production in our portfolio 
however  periodically we have sold a portion of our loans in the secondary market 
we are transitioning to selling a greater portion of our loans into the secondary market and retaining a smaller portion of our production 
a lack of demand or secondary market illiquidity could have an adverse effect on our balance sheet  earnings and capital levels 
we may need additional capital resources in the future and these capital resources may not be available when needed or at all 
we may need to incur additional debt or equity financing in the future for growth  investment or strategic acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may not be able to grow or make strategic acquisitions or investments 
net interest income could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates and lag in repricing of assets as compared to liabilities 
our profitability depends to a large extent on the bank s net interest income  which is the difference between income on interest earning assets such as mortgage loans and investment securities  and expense on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
we are affected by changes in general interest rate levels and by other economic factors beyond our control 
our net interest income may be reduced if i more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature during a time when interest rates are declining or ii more interest bearing liabilities than interest earning assets reprice or mature during a time when interest rates are rising 
changes in the difference between short and long term interest rates may also harm our business 
for example  short term deposits may be used to fund longer term loans 
when differences between short term and long term interest rates shrink or disappear  the spread between rates paid on deposits and received on loans could narrow significantly  decreasing our net interest income 
if market interest rates rise rapidly  interest rate adjustment caps may limit increases in the interest rates on adjustable rate loans arms  thus reducing our net interest income because we will need to pay the higher rates 
table of contents on our deposits and borrowings while being limited on the repricing of these loans due to the interest rate caps 
as of september   payment option loans made up approximately of our residential mortgage loan portfolio including loans held for sale and represented of our total loans excluding unearned premiums discounts  and deferred loan cost  and including loans held for sale 
the interest rates on payment option loans adjust periodically based upon a contractually agreed index or formula up to a specified cap 
in times of sharply rising interest rates  these caps could negatively affect our net interest margin by limiting the potential increase to interest income 
in addition  certain arm loans reprice based on lagging interest rate indices 
the effect of this lag may also negatively affect our net interest income when general interest rates continue to rise periodically 
lag risk results from timing differences between repricing of adjustable rate assets and liabilities 
the effect of this timing difference  or lag  would be generally favorable in a falling interest rate environment and negative during periods of rising interest rates 
this lag risk can produce short term volatility in the net interest margin during periods of interest rate movements even though over time the lag effect will balance out 
our earnings are affected by the relationship between the levels and movement of certain interest rates 
since august there has been a wide spread between treasury rates and the libor index 
the majority of our loans are based on the monthly treasury average mta index which is the average of the last months year treasury adjusted to a constant maturity 
thus a prolonged period with wide spreads between treasury and libor rates  without a return to the traditionally narrow spread between the two indices could limit our earnings 
an increase in loan prepayments and on prepayment of loans underlying mortgage backed securities may adversely affect our profitability 
prepayment rates are affected by consumer behavior  conditions in the housing and financial markets  general economic conditions and the relative interest rates on fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans 
changes in prepayment rates are therefore difficult for us to predict 
prepayments of our mortgage loans may increase as we continue to expand our mortgage loan originations outside of florida 
we recognize our deferred loan origination costs and premiums paid in originating these loans by adjusting our interest income over the contractual life of the individual loans 
as prepayments occur  the rate at which net deferred loan origination costs and premiums are expensed increases 
the effect of the increases of deferred costs and premium amortization may be mitigated by prepayment fees paid by the borrower when the loan is paid in full within a certain period of time which varies between loans 
if prepayment occurs after the period of time when the loan is subject to a prepayment fee  the effect of the acceleration of premium and deferred cost amortization is no longer mitigated 
as of september   we had million in unearned premiums  discounts and net deferred origination costs 
of the million  million were related to residential mortgage loans and million to commercial real estate loans 
we recognize premiums we pay on mortgage backed securities as an adjustment to interest income over the life of the security based on the rate of repayment of the securities 
acceleration of prepayments on the loans underlying a mortgage backed security shortens the life of the security  increases the rate at which premiums are expensed and further reduces interest income 
in addition  we may not be able to reinvest loan and security prepayments at rates comparable to the prepaid instrument particularly in a period of declining interest rates 
changes in interest rates could have additional adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in interest rates could have significant adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations  including  without limitation  decreasing the value of our mortgage servicing rights or our derivative 
table of contents instruments 
the initial and ongoing valuation and amortization of mortgage servicing rights is significantly impacted by interest rates  prepayment experience and the credit performance of the underlying loans 
mortgage servicing rights are also impacted by other factors  including  but not limited to  the amount of gains or losses recognized upon the securitization and sale of residential mortgage loans  the amortization of the assets and the periodic valuation of the assets 
at september   we serviced billion of loans for others and we had mortgage servicing rights with a carrying amount of million 
we are unable to predict changes in market interest rates  which are affected by many factors beyond our control including inflation  recession  unemployment  money supply  domestic and international events and changes in financial markets in the united states and in other countries 
our net interest income is affected not only by the level and direction of interest rates  but also by the shape of the yield curve and relationships between interest sensitive instruments and key driver rates basis risks such as rate differential between the mta and libor rates  as well as balance sheet growth  client loan and deposit preferences and the timing of changes in these variables 
in an increasing rate environment  our interest costs on liabilities may increase more rapidly than our income on interest earning assets 
this could result in a deterioration of our net interest margin 
changes in interest rates could also adversely affect our financial condition by reducing the value of our derivative instruments 
we use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management activities to reduce risk associated with our borrowing activities 
our use of derivative instruments  however  exposes us to credit risk and market risk 
our credit risk is heightened when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  which generally means that a counterparty owes money to us 
we try to minimize credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties 
while  our derivatives balance as of september  is a net credit of thousand  there can be no assurance that our financial evaluation of a counterparty will be accurate or that its financial status will not change 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument from a change in interest rates or implied volatility of rates 
we manage market risk by establishing and monitoring limits on the types and degree of risk undertaken 
changes in interest rates may have either a positive or negative effect on the value of a derivative instrument depending on the nature of the derivative instrument 
additionally  a substantial and sustained increase in interest rates could harm our ability to originate loans because refinancing an existing loan or taking out a subordinate mortgage would be less attractive  and qualifying for a loan may be more difficult 
the non cash portion of our net interest income and repayment risks may grow because of our concentration in payment option loans 
at september   our payment option loans made up of our total loans excluding unearned premiums discounts  and deferred loan costs  and including loans held for sale 
these loans provide the consumer with several payment options each month and may result in monthly payments being lower than the amount of interest due on the loan 
any unpaid monthly interest is added to the loan balance 
the amount of the negative amortization is a non cash item that is accrued in net interest income 
this amount of net interest income will continue to increase as the negative amortization in our payment option loans increases 
these loans provide the consumer with the ability to reduce his or her initial loan payment and limit the amount of annual increase in the required monthly payment 
the loans are re amortized and the loan payments re calculated at the earlier of i five years from inception of the loan  or ii when a loan balance has increased to of the original loan 
it is anticipated that approximately million of the payment option portfolio will reach the level during fiscal if a loan negatively amortizes in the initial year the consumer must make the payments up in the later years of the loan 
this presents a potential repayment risk if the consumer is unable to meet the higher payment or to repay the loan through refinancing or sale of the underlying property 

table of contents our exposure to credit risk is increased by our commercial real estate  commercial business and construction lending 
commercial real estate  commercial business and construction lending generally involve higher credit risk than single family residential lending 
such loans involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers 
at september   we had a balance of million in commercial real estate loans including multi family residential loans  million in construction loans  million in land and development loans  and million in commercial business loans 
commercial real estate loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy because commercial real estate borrowers ability to repay their loans depends on successful development of their properties  as well as the factors affecting residential real estate borrowers 
these loans also involve greater risk because they generally are not fully amortizing over the loan period  but have a balloon payment due at maturity 
a borrower s ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to either refinance the loan or timely sell the underlying property 
risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon whether our initial estimate of the property s value at completion of construction equals or exceeds the cost of the property construction including interest and the availability of permanent take out financing 
during the construction phase  a number of factors can result in delays and cost overruns 
if our estimate of value is inaccurate or if actual construction costs exceed estimates  the value of the property securing our loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan or by seizure of collateral 
commercial business loans are typically based on the borrowers ability to repay the loans from the cash flows of their businesses 
such loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay each loan depends substantially on the success of the business itself 
in addition  the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time  be difficult to appraise and liquidate  and fluctuate in value based on the success of the business 
commercial real estate  commercial business and construction loans are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle 
the underwriting  review and monitoring performed by our officers and directors cannot eliminate all of the risks related to these loans 
negative events in certain geographic areas could adversely affect our results 
some of our depositors and borrowers are citizens of other countries  including countries of europe  central and south america and the caribbean  who are in the process of moving to the united states or have second homes in the united states 
these loans are secured by property located in the united states  primarily in florida  and generally carry a lower loan to value ratio than loans to domestic residents 
as of september   the amount of residential mortgage loans made to these borrowers was approximately billion  or of our overall portfolio 
the value of the underlying property provides a source of liquidation in the united states but the consumer s ability to make his or her monthly payments may be affected by factors such as foreign exchange rates  capital outflow limitations  and other political and economic risks associated with the country of residence 
changes in the united states laws and regulations affecting residents from those countries could also adversely affect us if they result in a significant loss of deposits  increased loan defaults or a decreased market for our products 
we endeavor to limit our risk through our underwriting criteria on these loans 
adverse market conditions in florida could adversely impact us the majority of the loans in our portfolio are secured by residential and commercial properties in florida 
deteriorating market conditions  any economic downturn in florida or adverse changes in laws and regulations that impact the banking industry may have a negative impact on our business 
negative conditions in the florida real estate markets could adversely affect our borrowers ability to repay and the value of the underlying collateral 
real estate values are impacted by various factors  including general economic conditions  
table of contents governmental rules or policies and natural disasters  such as hurricanes 
additionally  our borrowers may be confronted with increased insurance costs as a result of such natural disasters 
these factors may adversely impact our borrowers ability to make required payments  which in turn  may negatively impact our results 
competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect our profitability 
the banking and financial services industry is very competitive 
legal and regulatory developments have made it easier for new and sometimes unregulated competitors to compete with us 
consolidation among financial service providers has resulted in fewer very large national and regional banking and financial institutions holding a large accumulation of assets 
these institutions generally have significantly greater resources  a wider geographic presence or greater accessibility to capital  compared to us 
our competitors sometimes are also able to offer more services  more favorable pricing or greater customer convenience than we do 
in addition  our competition has grown from new banks and other financial services providers that target our existing or potential customers 
as consolidation continues among large banks  we expect additional smaller institutions to try to exploit our market 
we face substantial competition for both deposits and loans 
we compete for deposits with banks  savings institutions and credit unions  as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives  including money market funds and mutual funds 
these competitors may offer higher interest rates than we do  which could decrease the deposits that we attract or require us to increase our rates to attract new deposits 
increased competition for deposits could increase our cost of funds and adversely affect our ability to generate the funds necessary for our lending operations 
competition for loans comes principally from other banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking companies and other lenders 
in originating mortgage loans  we compete with real estate investment trusts  investment banking firms  savings and loan associations  banks  mortgage bankers  insurance companies  mutual funds  other lenders  the fnma  the fhlmc  the government national mortgage association gnma and other entities purchasing mortgage loans 
this competition could decrease the number and size of loans that we make and the interest rates and fees that we receive on these loans 
the demand for residential mortgage loans in recent years has made it more difficult and expensive to recruit and retain the services of qualified lending personnel 
increased competition for loan officers and other personnel could hinder our ability to close loans and to improve our results of operations 
technological developments have allowed competitors  including some non depository institutions  to compete more effectively in local markets  and have expanded the range of financial products  services and capital available to our target customers 
if we are unable to implement  maintain and use such technologies effectively  we may not be able to offer products or achieve cost efficiencies necessary to compete in our industry 
in addition  some of these competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and lower cost structures 
we are dependent upon the services of our management team and qualified personnel 
we are dependent upon the ability and experience of a number of our key management personnel who have substantial experience with our operations  the financial services industry and the markets in which we offer our services 
it is possible that the loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or key managers would have an adverse effect on our operations 
we depend on our account executives and loan officers to attract borrowers by  among other things  developing relationships with commercial and consumer clients  mortgage companies  real estate agents  brokers and others 
we believe that these relationships lead to repeat and referral business 
the market for skilled account executives and loan officers is highly competitive and historically has experienced a high rate of turnover 
in addition  if a manager leaves our company  other members of the manager s team may follow 

table of contents competition for qualified account executives and loan officers may lead to increased hiring and retention costs 
our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  manage and retain other qualified personnel as we grow 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to attract or retain such personnel 
adjustments for loans held for sale may adversely affect our profits 
in our financial statements we must revalue  on a quarterly basis  loans that we originate and classify as held for sale to the lower of their cost or market value 
depending on market conditions  such adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations 
at september   loans held for sale totaled million compared to a total loan portfolio size of billion including unearned discounts  premiums and deferred loan costs at the same date 
we are exposed to credit risk from the sale of mortgage loans 
we retain limited exposure from the sale of mortgage loans 
we make standard representations and warranties to the purchasers 
if individual mortgages are found to have not complied with the representations and warranties  we may be required to repurchase the loans 
the standard representations and warranties do not assure against credit risk associated with the loans 
if we are unable to maintain or expand our volume of business with independent brokers  our loan origination business may decrease 
we originate a high volume of residential mortgage loans through a network of mortgage brokers 
we follow careful procedures to select the brokers with whom we establish relationships and the brokers are not required to work exclusively with us 
our competitors also have relationships with the brokers in our network and actively compete with us to obtain loans and increase broker relationships 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining our existing relationships or expanding our broker networks 
failure to do so could negatively affect the volume and profitability of our mortgage loan originations  and thus adversely affect our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
our earnings could be adversely impacted by incidences of fraud and compliance failures that are not within our direct control 
we are subject to fraud and compliance risk in connection with the origination of mortgage loans 
fraud risk includes the intentional misstatement of information in property appraisals or other underwriting documentation provided to us by third parties 
compliance risk is the risk that loans are not originated in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our standards 
there can be no assurance that we can prevent or detect acts of fraud or violation of law or our compliance standards by the third parties that we deal with 
repeated incidences of fraud or compliance failures adversely impact the performance of our portfolio and could require us to repurchase such loans which were sold in the secondary market 
we grant residential loans under reduced documentation programs  which accounted for of residential loans excluding unearned premiums  discounts and deferred loan costs as of september  customary industry guidelines for these programs may not require information about borrowers income and or assets to be submitted or verified 
to the extent borrowers overstate their income and or assets  the ability of borrowers to repay their loans may be impaired which could adversely affect the quality of our loan portfolio 
while we design and structure our underwriting guidelines and practices to mitigate this risk  these guidelines and mitigating practices may not be effective in preventing increased defaults by borrowers 
recent developments in the mortgage market may affect our ability to originate loans and the profitability of loans in our pipeline 
the mortgage lending industry has experienced a significant increase in delinquencies in recent months 
the decline in credit quality is most noteworthy among subprime lenders 
generally  we have not originated 
table of contents residential loans with credit scores below  except for cra loans 
over the last several years  we have continuously tightened our credit standards and since august we have concentrated our originations on loans with credit scores over while we have never been a subprime lender recent reports of credit quality  financial solvency and other problems among subprime lenders have increased volatility in the price of our common stock 
if the subprime segment continues to have problems in the future and or credit quality problems spread to other industry segments  including lenders who make reduced documentation loans to prime credit quality borrowers  there could be a prolonged decrease in the demand for our loans in the secondary market  adversely affecting our earnings and negatively impacting the price of our common stock 
the residential mortgage origination business is a cyclical industry  has started to decline from its highest levels ever  reducing the number of loans we originate and could adversely impact our business 
the residential mortgage origination business has historically been a cyclical industry  enjoying periods of strong growth and profitability followed by periods of shrinking volumes and industry wide losses 
the primary influence on our originations is the aggregate demand for loans in the united states  which is affected by prevailing interest rates 
increases in interest rates may adversely affect our results of operations 
liquidity risk our liquidity may be affected by an inability to access the capital markets or by unforeseen demands on cash 
this situation may arise due to circumstances beyond our control  such as a general market disruption 
during  there has been significant volatility in the capital markets 
in the fiscal year there was a market disruption resulting in an illiquid market for our loans 
the continuation of these conditions in the secondary market reduces our ability to raise liquidity through the sale of loans 
we cannot predict with any degree of certainty how long these market conditions may continue  nor can we anticipate the degree of impact such market conditions will have on loan origination volumes and gain on sale results 
additionally  several of our competitors have experienced rating downgrades based in part upon the market disruption 
a similar downgrade of the company s debt could have the effect of reducing the company s access to funding and increase borrowing costs 
loan sales may be difficult or less profitable to execute if our loans are defective 
in connection with the sales of our loans  we are required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding our company and the loans 
we are subject to these representations and warranties for the life of the loan and they relate to  among other things compliance with applicable laws  eligibility for whole loan sale or securitization  conformance with underwriting standards  the accuracy of the information in the loan documents and loan file  and the characteristics and enforceability of the loan 
we may not be able to sell a loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties  or such sale may require greater effort or expense 
if individual mortgages are found to have not complied with the representatives and warranties and if such loans are sold before we detect non compliance  we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly  or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such losses 
these circumstances could adversely impact the profitability of loan sales and our financial results 
failure to pay interest on our debt may adversely impact us 
deferral or default in making interest payments on debt could affect our ability to fund our operations and pay dividends on our common stock 
as of september   we had approximately million of trust 
table of contents preferred securities and subordinated debentures outstanding related to ten trust subsidiaries owned by us 
interest payments  including those on adjustable rate notes  are projected to be approximately million per year based on interest rates at september   which must be paid before we pay dividends on our capital stock  including our class a common stock 
we have the right to defer interest payments on the notes for up to consecutive quarters 
however  if we elect to defer interest payments  all deferred interest must be paid before we may pay dividends on our capital stock 
deferral of interest payments could also cause a decline in the market price of our class a common stock 
as of september   we also had credit lines of billion under our fhlb atlanta credit line of which billion including million in letters of credit was outstanding 
such borrowings from the fhlb atlanta were secured by a pledge of approximately billion of our residential first mortgage loans and other eligible collateral 
our total credit line with the fhlb atlanta is approximately of the bank s assets at each prior quarter s end 
failure to pay interest or principal on this debt could adversely affect our business by causing us to lose our collateral and the fhlb atlanta as a funding source 
in addition to our fhlb atlanta borrowings  we had million in repurchase agreements outstanding as of september  all of which are secured by mortgage backed securities or other investment securities 
as of september   we had outstanding million of convertible senior notes that mature in march and bear interest at an annual rate of payable semiannually 
upon conversion of the notes we will deliver cash for of the principal amount of the notes and may  at our discretion  in lieu of delivering shares of class a common stock  deliver cash or a combination of cash and shares of class a common stock for the profit shares 
we may redeem for cash some or all of the notes at any time on or after march  at of the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest  contingent interest and additional amounts  if any

the notes are senior unsecured obligations  ranking equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 
the notes are effectively subordinated to our entire senior secured indebtedness and all indebtedness and liabilities of its subsidiaries 
as of september   we had outstanding million of himeds equity units 
the himeds carry a total distribution rate of 
each unit has a stated amount of and is comprised of i a year purchase contract which will obligate the holder to purchase from bankunited on may   a certain number of shares of our class a common stock  for  and ii a undivided beneficial interest in  principal amount of our senior notes due may  holders of the himeds will be entitled to receive quarterly contract adjustment payments at a rate of per year of the state amount of per unit

if we do not manage our growth effectively  our financial performance could be harmed 
in recent years  we have experienced rapid growth that has placed certain pressures on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
as of september   we had  full time equivalent employees 
many of these employees have limited experience with us and a limited understanding of our systems and controls 
as we grow  we need to hire additional associates and management in an intensely competitive hiring environment 
additionally  we must upgrade and expand our operational  managerial and financial systems and controls 
plans for the continued development and growth of our business in the future will also require numerous resources  systems development and capital 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and hire qualified employees  expand our systems effectively  
table of contents allocate our human resources optimally  or meet our capital needs 
the failure to manage growth effectively could significantly harm our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
our ability to continue to grow depends  in part  on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel  open new branch locations  successfully attract deposits to those locations  and identify loan and investment opportunities 
we also depend on maintaining productive relationships with the brokers through whom we generate the majority of our one to four family residential mortgage loans that we originate 
our ability to profit from our growth also will depend on whether we can efficiently fund our growth  control our costs and maintain asset quality  as well as on factors beyond our control  such as economic conditions and interest rate trends 
market conditions affecting the demand for our products  which have existed since august may not be advantageous or support continued expansion 
if these conditions continue for a prolonged period we may reduce the size of our loan portfolio and balance sheet and our earnings could be adversely affected 
our future growth is dependent upon our ability to recruit additional  qualified employees  especially seasoned relationship bankers 
our business plan includes  and is dependent upon  hiring and retaining highly qualified and motivated executives and employees at every level 
in particular  our success has been partly the result of our management s ability to seek and retain highly qualified relationship bankers who have long standing relationships in their communities 
these professionals bring with them valuable customer relationships  and have been an integral part of our ability to attract deposits and to expand rapidly in our market areas 
we expect to experience substantial competition in our endeavor to identify  hire and retain the top quality employees that we believe are key to our future success 
if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees  we may not be able to grow our franchise and successfully execute our business strategy 
we rely heavily on the proper functioning of our technology 
we rely on our computer systems and outside servicers providing technology for much of our business  including recording our assets and liabilities 
if our computer systems or outside technology sources fail  are not reliable  or suffer a breach of security  our ability to maintain accurate financial records may be impaired  which could materially affect our operations and financial condition 
terrorist activities could cause reductions in investor confidence and substantial volatility in real estate and securities markets 
it is impossible to predict the extent to which terrorist activities may occur in the united states or other regions 
it is also uncertain what affects any past or future terrorist activities and or any consequent actions on the part of the united states government and others will have on the united states and world financial markets  local  regional and national economies  and real estate markets across the united states 
among other things  reduced investor confidence could result in substantial volatility in securities markets  a decline in general economic conditions and real estate related investments and an increase in loan defaults 
such unexpected losses and events could materially affect our results of operations 
tourism and the travel industry are important factors to the general economy of our primary market  which could be adversely affected by terrorism 
valuation risk we carry certain assets  including investments and mortgage backed securities  at fair value 
generally  for asset that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value 
in certain cases quoted market prices or market data inputs may not be readily available or availability could be diminished due to market conditions 
in those cases  different assumptions could result in significant changes in valuation 

table of contents we are subject to extensive regulation that could restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business and limit our ability to receive dividends from the bank 
the bank is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the ots as its primary federal regulator  and by the fdic  which insures its deposits 
as a member of the fhlb  the bank must also comply with applicable regulations of the federal housing finance board and the fhlb 
regulation by these agencies is intended primarily for the protection of our depositors and the deposit insurance fund and not for the benefit of our stockholders 
the bank s activities are also regulated under consumer protection laws applicable to our lending  deposit and other activities 
a sufficient claim against us under these laws could have a material adverse effect on our results 
among other things  the bank s ability to pay cash dividends to the holding company is limited by these regulations 
the bank must notify the ots in advance of any proposed distribution  and may not pay dividends or distribute any capital assets if the distribution is disapproved by the ots 
ots regulations also impose certain minimum capital requirements that affect the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends by the bank 
because income is received by us from the bank through dividend payments  our ability to service the debt issued by us and dividends on our capital stock is limited by the financial condition of the bank 
the bank s ability to make capital distributions is subject to regulatory limitations 
generally the bank may make a capital distribution if notice of the proposed capital distribution is filed with the ots at least days before the board of directors approves the distribution  and the ots does not disapprove the notice 
the ots may disapprove the notice if it determines that the bank would be undercapitalized after the proposed distribution  that the proposed distribution raises safety and soundness concerns or that the proposed distribution would violate a statute  regulation or agreement with the ots or any condition imposed by the ots 
the bank s ability to make such distribution by filing a notice  instead of an application for approval  depends on maintaining eligibility for expedited status 
the bank currently qualifies for expedited status  but there can be no assurance that it will maintain its current status 
in addition  the bank would be required to file an application for approval of the proposed distribution  instead of a notice  if the total amount of all capital distributions for the calendar year  including the proposed distribution  would exceed the bank s net income for that year plus retained net income for the preceding two years 
fdic regulations also require all insured depository institutions to remain in a safe and sound condition  as defined in regulations  as a condition of federal deposit insurance 
ots regulations also restrict our ability to open new banking offices 
we must publish notice of the proposed office in area newspapers and  if objections are made  the new office may be delayed or disapproved 
the agencies have also promulgated guidelines regarding nontraditional mortgages  which could result in additional scrutiny regarding the underwriting and portfolio management of arms  as well as establishing specific disclosure requirements for payment option and interest only mortgages 
it is possible that one or more legislative proposals may be adopted or regulatory changes may be made that would have an adverse effect on our business 
changes in the regulation of financial services companies and housing government sponsored entities could adversely affect our business 
proposals for further regulation of the financial services industry are continually being introduced in congress 
the agencies regulating the financial services industry also periodically adopt changes to their regulations 
proposals that are now receiving a great deal of attention include regulation of government sponsored entities  consumer protection initiatives relating to capital  consumer loan disclosures  security of customer information  marketing practices  the real estate settlement procedures act  predatory lending and risk management for commercial real estate loans 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory activities that could be used to restrict our business 
changes in the laws or regulations that govern us could further restrict our operations  impose burdensome requirements and increase our expenses which could impair our ability to meet our obligations 

table of contents our operations could be harmed by a challenging legal climate 
class action or other litigation against lenders in certain regions or related to particular products  services or practices may arise from time to time  even if the activities subject to complaint are not unlawful 
such claims may be brought  for example  under state or federal consumer protection laws 
the damages and penalties claimed in these types of matters can be substantial 
we may also be adversely affected by the actions of our brokers  or if another company in our industry engages in criticized practices 
negative publicity may result in more regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices  as well as more litigation  which may further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by impeding our ability to market our products  requiring us to change them or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate 
negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely affect our earnings 
reputational risk is the risk to our operations from negative public opinion 
negative public opinion can result from the actual or perceived manner in which we conduct our business activities  including our sales practices  practices used in our origination and servicing operations and retail banking operations  our management of actual or potential conflicts of interest and ethical issues  and our protection of confidential customer information 
negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract customers and can expose us to litigation

no assurance can be given that new legislation  treasury regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualifications as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification in a way that would adversely affect our reit subsidiary s ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust 
any such legislation could cause a tax event that would adversely affect our future consolidated after tax earnings 
provisions in our articles of incorporation  bylaws and florida law could impede efforts to remove management and frustrate takeover attempts 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and make a merger  tender offer or proxy contest more difficult  even if such events appear to benefit stockholders 
certain provisions of state and federal law may also discourage or prohibit a future takeover attempt in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a substantial premium for their shares over then current market prices

table of contents purchases of bankunited stock on october   our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for its class a common stock 
under the program  we could initially purchase up to  shares of our class a common stock in open market transactions  from time to time  at such prices and on such conditions as the executive committee of the board of directors determines to be advantageous 
this plan does not have an expiration date 
bankunited initiated this program in the belief that the volatility of the financial markets  in general  has at times generated a market price that does not adequately reflect the real value of our stock or the level of confidence that management and the board of directors have in our ability to implement our strategy and achieve continued growth 
bankunited intends to repurchase shares under this authorization as the executive committee deems such repurchases appropriate 
the basis for the carrying value of our treasury stock is the purchase price or fair value of the shares in the open market at the time of purchase 
on october   the board of directors increased the number of shares that could be acquired under the stock repurchase program from  shares to  shares

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis and the related financial data present a review of the consolidated financial condition and operating results of bankunited for the periods presented 
this discussion and analysis is presented to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating the financial condition  results of operations and future prospects of bankunited  and is intended to supplement  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview our results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on assets  primarily our loan and securities portfolios  and our cost of funds  which consists of the interest paid on our deposits and borrowings 
our results of operations are also affected by our provision for loan losses  gain or loss on the sale of loans  other non interest income  non interest expenses and income taxes 
our operations  like those of other financial institution holding companies  are affected by our asset and liability management policies  as well as factors beyond our control  such as general economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government 
lending activities are affected by the demand for mortgage financing and other types of loans  and are thus influenced by interest rates and other factors that are beyond management s control 
deposit flows and cost of deposits and borrowings are influenced by local competition and by general market rates of interest 
bankunited executed its strategy effectively during fiscal to achieve record operating net income for the fiscal year 
however  our net income was adversely affected by the deterioration in general economic conditions and real estate markets throughout the country  particularly in certain geographic regions  and the generalized fear caused by the crisis in the subprime lending industry 
while bankunited is not  and has not been  a subprime lender  like other lenders throughout the mortgage industry our asset quality declined during the fiscal year as mortgage borrowers experienced a downturn in residential real estate values and economic conditions 
our net charge offs remained low as a percentage of average annual loans during fiscal  but increased by compared to fiscal non performing assets increased throughout the fiscal year  and are expected to continue increasing in fiscal during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year bankunited significantly increased its allowance for loan losses relative to its level of non performing assets and past practice  in consideration of industry trends and continued difficulty in the housing markets  particularly in regions impacted by housing price decreases 
we anticipate that we may take larger provisions for loan losses during the coming year  if deemed appropriate 
our net income for fiscal was also affected by reduced demand and profitability for payment option loan sales in the secondary market and further tightening of our credit standards 
the crisis in the subprime lending market has generated substantial speculation and concern in the financial markets that the same level of mortgage delinquencies and writedowns of securities will occur with respect to lower documentation loans and payment option loans 
while bankunited has for years applied many of the principles now required by banking regulators for non traditional loans such as payment option loans  and has historically employed compensating underwriting criteria on lower documentation loans  the generalized concern in the secondary markets reduced our opportunities for profitable sales of our loans during the fiscal year 
we sold million of payment option loans into the secondary market in fiscal  as compared to billion in fiscal  and none during the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal although the demise of numerous mortgage lenders  especially subprime lenders  during created some opportunities for producing loans  many lenders  including bankunited  tightened credit standards in consideration of the risk posed by market conditions 
some of our larger competitors  however  also ran aggressive pricing campaigns to gain market share 
these elements combined to negatively affect bankunited s loan productions efforts during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 
table of contents the problems in the subprime lending market also inhibited funding sources in the capital markets  as writedowns of securities and rating downgrades cast doubt on collateral values 
besides deeming it prudent to further tighten our credit standards  during the fiscal year we determined to preserve our capital levels by limiting growth 
we are transitioning to selling more loans into the secondary market rather than maintaining the majority for portfolio  and we have altered our residential loan production mix to comprise approximately saleable residential mortgage loans  which are sold to fnma  fhlmc  and other conduits 
in addition  during fiscal  we transitioned the production of payment option loans from those that are monthly adjustable to a select my payment product which carries a fixed rate for three or five years and then becomes an adjustable rate loan 
this product also carries payment rates with generally higher payment start rates than our monthly payment option loan 
for the quarter ended september   our monthly adjustable payment option production comprised only of total production 
significant items for fiscal included net income of million compared to million for fiscal net interest margin of  an increase of basis points from fiscal total assets of billion at september   up billion  or  from september  asset growth was centered in the residential loan portfolio  which grew by billion during the fiscal year 
during fiscal we shifted our focus to originating a select my payment product that has a fixed interest rate for three or five years before converting to an adjustable rate 
this product also carries payment options 
total loans grew by billion  or  to billion at september  compared to billion at september  total deposits reached billion at september   up billion  or  from september  issued million from the sale of  himeds equity units 
the units require holders to purchase common equity by may at a price in the range of to 
bankunited commenced operations in the two new florida coastal markets of indian river and pinellas counties  opened ten new neighborhood branches  and opened two additional residential loan offices in oregon and colorado during the fiscal year 
provisions for loan losses totaling million were taken during the fiscal year  up million or from fiscal this increase reflects industry trends and continued difficulties in the housing markets  as well as the increase in bankunited s level of non performing assets 
however  during fiscal net charge offs remained low at in proportion to the loan portfolio 
due to the continued deterioration of real estate market conditions  non accrual loans and real estate owned reo are expected to increase in the fiscal year 
while not necessarily indicative of future results  the following tables present the changes in our non accruing loans and reo during the month of october non accruing loans during october total loans dollar amount number of loans dollars in thousands non accruing loans at september  loans placed on non accrual status foreclosed loans transferred to reo loans past due days and still accruing and transferred to non accrual loan amounts charged off loans returned to accrual status or paid in full non accruing loans at october  
table of contents reo during october total properties dollar amount number of properties dollars in thousands total properties at september  transfers from loan portfolio at estimated net realizable value after charge off loss on disposition sales total properties at october  dispositions net of additional write offs of thousand 
of the total million in reo at september   approximately million had million in mortgage insurance coverage 
bankunited anticipates that the environment will continue to be challenging  and intends to continue concentrating during fiscal on absorbing the growth of the last two years  achieving efficiencies in all of its business lines and executing its expense control measures 
in spite of the significant volatility in the real estate markets  the continuing downturn in the housing sector  and the likelihood that non performing assets have not yet leveled off  we have several factors that are expected to aid our future performance our capital position is strong  we are a florida based banking franchise with strong liquidity sources  our net charge offs remain manageable and we have an experienced management team 
critical accounting estimates our financial position and results of operations are impacted by management s application of accounting policies involving judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of certain assets 
in implementing our policies  management must make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently less than certain 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates  which could materially affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  income and expenses 
critical accounting estimates made by management include those that relate to the allowance for loan losses  the carrying amount of investments and mortgage backed securities available for sale  and stock based compensation 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a subjective judgment that management must make regarding the loan portfolio  and is established and maintained at levels that management believes are adequate to cover probable losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payments on loans 
estimates for loan losses are made by analyzing historical loan losses  current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  plans for problem loan administration and resolution  the views of regulators  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  and peer group information 
in addition  the economic climate and direction  increases or decreases in overall lending rates  political conditions  legislation directly or indirectly impacting the banking industry  and economic conditions affecting specific geographical areas in which bankunited conducts business are all considered 
we transfer a portion of our credit risk on residential loans by requiring mortgage insurance on a portion of our loans 
where there is a question as to the impairment of a non homogenous loan  management obtains valuations of the property or collateral securing the loan  and current financial information of the borrower  including financial statements  when available 
since the calculation of appropriate loan loss allowances relies on management s estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  actual results may differ from these estimates

table of contents investments and mortgage backed securities available for sale several estimates impact the periodic valuation of investments and mortgage backed securities  which are carried at fair value 
generally  the bank uses third party pricing services to assist management in estimating the fair value of its securities 
for a limited number of securities for which third party pricing is not available  the bank uses internal valuation models to calculate fair value 
the vast majority of our investments and mortgage backed securities were purchased prior to and as such have relatively short remaining lives 
for a more detailed discussion on investment securities and mortgage backed securities available for sale  see notes investments and mortgage backed securities available for sale and estimated fair value of financial instruments to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation several assumptions are made in the determination of stock based compensation 
bankunited utilizes the black scholes model to calculate stock based compensation under sfas no 
r 
estimates of expected volatility  expected life of options  applicable risk free interest rate affect the computation of the fair value of options to be expensed 
assumptions are also made as to the expected achievement of performance conditions for performance based stock grants 
estimates of expected forefeiture rates are made for both options and stock grants

liquidity and capital resources bankunited s objective in managing liquidity is to maintain sufficient resources of available liquid assets to address both short and long term business funding needs such as loan demand  investment purchases  deposit fluctuations  and debt service requirements 
in doing so  bankunited maintains an overall liquidity position that has an aggregate amount of readily accessible and marketable assets  cash flow and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected deposit outflows and or increases in loan demand 
cash levels may vary but are maintained at levels required by regulation and necessary to meet the projected anticipated needs for business operations 
bankunited is not aware of any events  or uncertainties which may impede liquidity in the short or long term 
bankunited  fsb has a borrowing line available at the fhlb of atlanta secured by eligible real estate loans which were billion as of september  bankunited has additional borrowing capacity through securities sold under repurchase agreements with various counterparts which were million as of september  short term borrowing facilities are also available through fed funds purchased from other financial institutions 
from time to time  we utilize our access to capital markets and may raise capital through equity and debt offerings 
we have also utilized trust preferred and subordinated debt issuances to provide a source of capital for the bank 
in april  we raised million through the sale of  himeds equity units 
the equity units require the holders to purchase common equity by may at a price in the range of to 
we believe that our current sources of funds  including repayments of existing loans  enable us to meet our obligations while maintaining liquidity at appropriate levels 
deposits bankunited s expanding network of neighborhood banking offices and internet deposit offerings allow it to raise deposits over a wide geographic area

borrowings a substantial portion of bankunited s balance sheet growth has been funded by short term and long term borrowings 
short term borrowings are due within one year  long term borrowings are due in one year or more 
in addition to borrowings available as a member of the fhlb atlanta  bankunited utilizes securities sold under agreements to repurchase  subordinated notes  and trust preferred securities as sources of borrowings 
the fhlb atlanta offers a wide variety of borrowing plans to member financial institutions with fixed  variable  or convertible rates 
borrowings from the fhlb  known as advances  are secured by a member s share of stock in the fhlb  that are required to be purchased in proportion to outstanding advances  and by certain types of mortgages and other eligible collateral 
the terms and rates charged for fhlb advances vary in response to general economic conditions 
the fhlb atlanta will consider various factors  including an institution s regulatory capital position  net income  quality and composition of assets  lending policies and practices  and level of current borrowings from all sources  in determining the amount of credit to extend to an institution 
in addition  an institution that fails to meet the qualified thrift lender test may have restrictions imposed on its ability to obtain fhlb advances 
the bank currently meets the qualified thrift lender test 
as of september   bankunited had billion of fhlb advances outstanding  including approximately million maturing within days and an additional billion maturing within one year 
advances outstanding as of september  were secured by loans with a carrying value of approximately billion 
approximately billion  million  and million of the advances outstanding as of september  were fixed  variable  and convertible  respectively 
the fhlb convertible advance programs permit the fhlb to call an advance or to change the rate structure at the call date 
convertible advances generally fall under one of two programs  one with a single specified call date after which the rate changes to a floating rate and the other with a specified initial call date that resets every ninety days thereafter 
specific call features vary on each advance including bankunited s ability to prepay the advance

the high ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans receivable loans held in portfolio before allowance for loan losses in was due to a high level of charge offs in the commercial loan portfolio 
during the first quarter of the fiscal year we shifted the focus of our residential loan originations to a select my payment product 
this represented a shift from the last three years when we focused primarily on production of the monthly payment option arm loan product which adjusts interest rates on a monthly basis but maintains a fixed minimum payment for a year and limits annual minimum required payment increases 

table of contents our select my payment product is available with a fixed interest rate for a period of either three or five years and then becomes an adjustable rate loan 
this is a payment option product 
this loan generally requires a minimum cash payment of approximately to in interest per month 
at month or depending on the fixed period  the loan payment is recast to be amortized over the remaining term 
these payments will change every twelve months after the initial payment change date 
there are limitations on each payment increase  with the exception of the initial payout change  and each fifth subsequent change thereafter 
if the monthly minimum payment is not sufficient to pay all the monthly interest  the unpaid interest may be deferred up to of the original principal balance at any time during the life of the loan 
unlike monthly payment option loans the maximum possible deferred interest for the fixed rate period is determinable at origination 
the monthly adjustable payment option loans are indexed to the monthly treasury average mta 
the mta index is the twelve month moving average of the monthly average yields on us treasury securities with a constant maturity of one year 
the twelve month look back period and averaging nature of mta index results in a slower reaction to changes in short term interest rates on assets indexed to the mta than on liabilities priced at the short term market rates 
this lag  combined with fluctuations in interest earned when borrowers exercise their payment options  can produce volatility in the net interest margin 
in a rising interest rate environment  the lagging effect tends to reduce the net interest margin with improvement in the margin occurring as short term interest rates level off or decline 
the magnitude of the impact of lag on margin is a function of the size of the interest rate movement and frequency of change  while the timing of the lag is driven by the averaging of the index over a twelve month period 
conversely  in a decreasing rate environment  this lagging effect tends to improve the net interest margin for the same reason 
originations of residential loans including our specialty consumer mortgage product totaled billion for fiscal  down from billion in due to various economic and market conditions 
as noted  we shifted our focus to the select my payment product in the first quarter of fiscal year this product constituted   and of our payment option loan originations for the second  third and fourth quarter of the fiscal year  respectively 
as a result  for the quarter ended september   our monthly adjustable payment option production comprised only of total loan production 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in light of certain liquidity and credit events in the financial markets  we elected to limit the growth  and possibly decrease  the size of our residential loan balances 
accordingly  we further refined our production mix to originate a higher proportion of saleable product  particularly to fnma and fhlmc as well as other conduits 
these saleable products comprised approximately of our fourth quarter production and its expected to be the majority of our production for the next several quarters

estimates for loan losses are made by analyzing historical loan losses  current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  plans for problem loan administration and resolution  the views of our regulators  changes in the size of the portfolio and peer group information 
an increase in the provision for fiscal was deemed appropriate because of the following trends the continued weakening and uncertainty in certain residential real estate markets including declines in prices which have been exacerbated by continuing builder price reductions in our primary markets  the weak performance of the vintage of residential loans which continue to under perform compared to other vintages  and the continued increase in capitalized interest balances on negative amortizing loans 
as more borrowers near their limit of negative amortization permitted under the terms of their loans  the greater the increase in probability that their loan payment will increase  causing a potential for increased nonperforming assets

the unallocated component of the allowance for long losses reflects management s evaluation of conditions that are not directly attributable to credit risks  inherent in specific loan products due to the imprecision that is inherent in credit loss estimation techniques 
the conditions evaluated in connection with the unallocated allowance include national and local economic trends and conditions  industry conditions  recent loan portfolio performance  loan growth and concentrations  changes in underwriting criteria  and the regulatory and public policy environment 

table of contents management believes that the allowance for loan losses of million as of september  was adequate given the strength of our collateral position and the attention given to loan review and classifications 
there can be no assurance that additional provisions for loan losses will remain at the level recorded in fiscal bankunited anticipates that provisions for loan losses may be made at higher levels during fiscal than in prior years  in light of increasing non performing assets  industry trends and real estate market conditions

net interest income before provision for loan losses was million for the year ended september  this represents an increase of million  or  over the million reported for the same period in the net interest margin improved in fiscal year to from for fiscal year the overall yield on interest earning assets increased by basis points  while the overall rates paid on interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points  resulting in an improvement in the interest rate spread of basis points for fiscal as compared to fiscal year interest income on loans includes deferred interest on payment option loans where periodic payments do not cover the amount of interest earned contractually and where the uncollected interest is added to the principal balance of the loans 
deferred interest resulting in negative amortization  where the loan balance exceeds the original loan balance amounted to million at september  compared to million at september  the amount of deferred interest has remained relatively constant over the last few quarters as interest rates remained relatively stable 
generally  the generation of negative amortization grows as interest rates increase  slows as interest rates stabilize and reduces as interest rates decrease and pre payments rise 
the improvement in net interest income and net interest margin is attributable to the growth in earning assets  the change in earning asset mix  the improved spread between earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and faster repricing of arm loans than deposits 
average earning assets for fiscal increased by billion  or  from the preceding fiscal year 
growth was centered in higher yield average loans that represent of earning assets in the current fiscal year as compared to in the fiscal year ended september  the net interest spread rose to for fiscal from for fiscal the change in net interest income  net interest spread and net interest margin is almost entirely attributable to improving yield on loans exceeding the increased cost of interest bearing liabilities and to the increase in loan volume exceeding the overall earning asset growth 
other factors affecting the yield improvement on assets include prepayment fees that increased from million in fiscal to million in the fiscal year ended september  prepayments on residential mortgage loans reduce loan interest income as the net deferred cost amortization is accelerated with the prepayment 
for the year ended september   the constant prepayment rate cpr was as compared to for the year ended september  the slower prepayment rate also contributed to the increase in the net interest margin for the year 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses totaled million for fiscal representing an increase from the million for fiscal the increase reflects negative market trends in the overall general mortgage market including decreasing housing prices as well as trends in our non performing loans for certain vintages and geographic markets 
non performing loans increased from million at september  to million at september also  to a lesser extent the provision represents a proportional increase in net charge offs and portfolio growth

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity as a financial intermediary bankunited invests in various types of interest earning assets primarily loans  mortgage backed securities  and investment securities which are funded largely by interest bearing liabilities primarily deposits  fhlb advances  repurchase agreements  senior notes  and trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures 
none of these financial instruments are entered into for trading purposes 
such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market interest rates that creates interest rate risk for the bank 
accordingly  bankunited s net interest income  the most significant component of its net income  is impacted by changes in market interest rates and yield curves  particularly if there are differences  or gaps  in the repricing frequencies of its interest earning assets and the interest bearing liabilities which fund them 
bankunited monitors such interest rate gaps and seeks to manage its interest rate risk by adjusting the repricing frequencies of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition to reviewing reports which summarize bankunited s various interest sensitivity gaps  management utilizes a simulation model which measures the financial impact certain interest rate scenarios are likely to have on the bank 
as discussed more fully below  a variety of factors influence the repricing characteristics and the market values of bankunited s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  but many of these factors are difficult to quantify 
additionally  bankunited utilizes derivative financial instruments designed to reduce the interest rate risk associated with its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will contractually mature or reprice  or if by management assumption  it is likely to be impacted by prepayments  run off  early withdrawal  or other such forces which can impact the timing and amount of a given financial instrument s cash flows 
an interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice within that same period 
a gap is considered to be positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing within a specific time frame exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time frame 
conversely  a gap is considered to be negative when  within a given period of time  the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period where the general level of interest rates is rising  a bank with a negative gap over that period is likely to experience a decline in net interest income  while a bank with a positive gap will typically experience an increase in net interest income 
during fiscal we transitioned the production of payment option loans from those that are monthly adjustable to a product that carries a fixed rate for three or five years and has funded this growth with liabilities of similar duration 
significant assumptions utilized in managing interest rate risk assessing and managing bankunited s exposure to interest rate risk involves significant assumptions concerning the exercise of options which are considered to be embedded in many of the financial instruments on bankunited s balance sheet  the expected movement and relationship of various interest rate indices  the impact of lag and cap risk  and the general availability of mortgages 
embedded options 
as of september   a substantial portion of bankunited s loans and mortgage backed securities consist of mortgage loans that contain an embedded option allowing borrowers to repay all  or a portion of  their loan prior to maturity 
the existence of this embedded prepayment option can adversely impact bankunited s financial performance 
in general  fixed rate securities tend to exhibit an increase in market value when the level of interest rates falls  and they tend to exhibit a decrease in market value when the level of interest rates rises 
mortgage loans having embedded prepayment options  and the securities which contain them  tend to decrease in market value as interest rates rise 
however increases in market value due to a decrease in interest rates are typically suppressed since in a lower rate environment borrowers are more likely to prepay  or 
table of contents refinance  their mortgage loans 
consequently  the adverse impact an investment in mortgage loans or mortgage securities may have on bankunited s market value of equity  should interest rates rise  may exceed the beneficial impact should interest rates fall by a like amount 
additionally  in an increasing interest rate environment bankunited s funding costs may be expected to increase more quickly than would bankunited s earnings from its mortgage loan assets 
this could result in a deterioration in bankunited s net interest margin 
however  due to the asymmetry discussed previously  improvement in bankunited s net interest margin due to a general decrease in interest rates may be less than the deterioration in bankunited s net interest margin given a similar increase in the general level of interest rates 
we recognize our deferred loan origination costs and premiums paid in originating these loans by adjusting our interest income over the contractual life of the individual loans 
as prepayments occur  the rate at which net deferred loan origination costs and premiums are expensed accelerates 
a borrower s propensity for prepayment is dependent upon a number of factors  some of which are the loan s current interest rate versus the rate at which the borrower would be able to refinance  the economic benefit expected to be obtained from refinancing  the borrower s financial ability to refinance  the availability of mortgage loans in general  prepayment fees and numerous other economic and non economic factors  some of which may vary by geographic region 
savings and checking deposits generally may be withdrawn upon customer request without prior notice 
however  on an overall basis  one customer s withdrawal is likely to be offset by another customer s deposit resulting in a dependable source of funds 
time deposits are generally subject to early withdrawal penalties  which results in the large majority of these deposits being maintained until maturity 
similarly  term fhlb advances have prepayment penalties  which discourage early repayment by the bank 
bankunited s trust preferred securities may be redeemed at par plus accrued interest receivable after five years from the issuance date 
see note borrowings to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the trust preferred securities 
bankunited borrows from the fhlb in the form of advances to fund operations 
these advances have a variety of terms  rates and repayment provisions 
approximately million of advances outstanding as of september  have been obtained through a convertible advances program 
the fhlb convertible advance programs permit the fhlb to call an advance or to change the rate structure at the call date 
convertible advances generally fall under one of two programs  one with a single specified call date after which the rate changes to a floating rate and the other with a specified initial call date that resets every ninety days thereafter 
specific call features vary on each advance  including bankunited s ability to prepay the advance 
the next call date on current advances ranges from three months to four years 
if the fhlb elects to exercise their options under the convertible advance programs  bankunited s cost of funds may be affected adversely 
the convertible advances outstanding as of september  of million have a weighted average coupon rate of 
interest rate indices 
the majority of bankunited s arm loans and mortgage backed securities are primarily indexed to the one year constant maturity treasury cmt or mta indices 
bankunited s commercial and consumer loans may be indexed to prime or libor 
to the extent such loans and mortgage backed securities are funded by deposits  fhlb advances  and other interest bearing liabilities whose interest costs are influenced by indices not highly correlated with the above indices  an environment of changing interest rates may impact the various indices differently which may lead to significant changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from  bankunited s financial instruments 
historical relationships between various indices may not necessarily be indicative of future relationships 
lag risk 
lag risk results from timing differences between repricing of adjustable rate assets and liabilities 
the effect of this timing difference  or lag  would be favorable in a falling interest rate environment and 
table of contents negative during periods of rising interest rates 
this lag risk can produce short term volatility in the net interest margin during periods of interest rate movements even though over time the lag effect will balance out 
as an illustration we have loans indexed to the mta 
loans may be delayed in repricing to current interest rate levels during a period of rapidly rising interest rates while liabilities generally reprice to current market interest rates more rapidly 
cap risk 
in times of sharply rising interest rates  caps may serve to limit the increase in interest income generated from certain interest earning assets 
conversely  in an environment of sharply falling interest rates  they may reduce the decline in bankunited s interest income 
over periods of time where the general level of interest rates has had time to fluctuate  the alternating positive and negative effects generated by such interest rate caps will be largely offsetting 
over shorter periods  however  and to the extent any caps are actually limiting the interest rate adjustment of any assets  they can increase the volatility of bankunited s net interest income  and to a lesser extent  its market value of equity 
availability of mortgage loans 
the availability of mortgage loans meeting bankunited s criteria is dependent upon  among other things  the size and level of activity in the residential real estate lending market  which in turn depends on other factors including the level of interest rates  regional and national economic conditions and changes in residential real estate values 
to the extent that bankunited is unable to originate or acquire a sufficient volume of mortgage loans meeting its criteria  bankunited s operating results could be adversely affected 
in originating or acquiring mortgage loans  bankunited competes with reits  investment banking firms  savings and loan associations  banks  mortgage bankers  insurance companies  mutual funds  competing lenders  fnma  fhlmc  gnma  and other entities which purchase mortgage loans  some of which have greater financial resources than bankunited 
increased competition for the origination or acquisition of eligible mortgage loans or a diminution in the supply could result in bankunited having to incur higher costs and accept lower yields 
this  in turn  would reduce the amount by which bankunited s yield on earning assets would exceed its cost of funding those assets 
the following table sets forth the re pricing gap between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities expected to mature or re price within the same period of time 
this gap analysis is a static view as of september  the analysis reflects assumptions made as to the prepayment of residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
assumptions are also made as to the re pricing period of deposits that have no stated maturity and are not contractually subject to re pricing except as determined by bankunited 
other interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have been scheduled to re price based on the earlier contractual re pricing or final maturity date of the contract 
assumptions as to the prepayment of mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage loans are based upon expected prepayment speeds and an analysis of current market conditions 
money market  savings and transaction accounts are assumed to re price based upon deposit decay estimates determined by bankunited 
pricing of these deposits is determined by bankunited based upon market conditions and other factors 
the conditions and assumptions utilized in this analysis may not be appropriate at another point in time 
consequently  the interpretation of this information is highly subjective

table of contents in addition to preparing and reviewing periodic gap reports which help identify repricing mismatches  bankunited uses simulation models which estimate the impact on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics  such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics based on bankunited s expectations for the next months 
simulations are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net income and capital 
from these scenarios  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed on an ongoing basis by senior management 
based on the information and assumptions in effect on september   management estimates the impact  on net interest income  of a gradual and parallel basis point rise or fall in interest rates over the next months to be a decrease of or an increase of of net interest income  respectively 
bankunited recognizes that there are numerous assumptions and estimates associated with the simulations described above which may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the simulation model assumes that the composition of bankunited s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains relatively constant over the period being measured and also assumes that the change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
in addition  prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are highly subjective in nature  involve uncertainties and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
accordingly  although the simulation model may provide an indication of bankunited s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to provide for a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on bankunited s net interest income and may often differ from actual results 
bankunited s operations are affected by many factors beyond its control such as the overall condition of the economy  monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  and regulations specific to the banking industry 
revenues generated from lending activities are impacted by loan demand  which in turn impacts the interest rates at which such loans may be made  the supply of housing  the availability of funds to lend  and the cost of obtaining such funds 
derivative and hedging activities 
bankunited uses derivative instruments as part of its interest rate risk management activities to reduce risks associated with its borrowing activities 
derivatives used for interest rate risk management include various interest rate swaps and caps that relate to the pricing of specific on balance sheet instruments and forecasted transactions 
in connection with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition and report them at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in either earnings or in other comprehensive income  depending on the purpose for which the derivative is held and whether the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting 
bankunited has one interest rate cap agreement that qualifies as a cash flow hedge 
bankunited uses cash flow hedges to hedge interest rate risk associated with variable rate debt 
in connection with its interest rate management activities  bankunited may use other derivatives as economic hedges of on balance sheet assets and liabilities or forecasted transactions which do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas accordingly  these derivatives are reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with realized gains and losses included in earnings 
by using derivative instruments  bankunited is exposed to credit and market risk 
credit risk  which is the risk that a counterparty to a derivative instrument will fail to perform  is equal to the extent of the fair value gain in a derivative 
credit risk is created when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  since this generally 
table of contents indicates that the counterparty owes us 
when the fair value of a derivative is negative  no credit risk exists since bankunited would owe the counterparty 
bankunited minimizes the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties as evaluated by management 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument from a change in interest rates or implied volatility of rates 
we manage the market risk associated with interest rate contracts by establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken 
the market risk associated with derivatives used for interest rate risk management activity is fully incorporated into our market risk sensitivity analysis
