net credit swap revenue net credit swap revenue in our consolidated statements of operations  comprises the premiums earned and expensed on credit swaps  gains or losses realized as a result of the termination of credit swaps and changes in the fair value of our credit swaps 
net credit swap revenue is earned by both primus financial and prs trading strategies 
although both companies earn net credit swap revenue  the strategies of the two companies are different 
primus financial generally sells credit swaps in order to earn premium income over the tenor of the contract  generally five years  whereas prs trading strategies engages in the active buying and selling of credit swaps and generally will only hold positions for a limited portion of the swap rs quo  s full tenor 
we receive premium income from the credit swaps we sell 
in general  premiums are received quarterly in arrears and are accrued daily into income 
in accordance with us gaap  we carry our credit swaps on our consolidated statements of financial condition at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of our credit swap portfolio are included as a component of net credit swap revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
if a credit swap has an increase or decline in fair value during a period  the increase will add to our net credit swap revenue and the decline will subtract from our net credit swap revenue for that period 
changes in the fair value of our credit swap portfolio are a function of the notional amount and c omposition of the portfolio and prevailing market credit swap premiums for comparable credit swaps 
in our experience  considerable fluctuations may occur in the fair values of credit swaps from period to period and  as a result  the reader of our financial statements should not infer future results from historical net credit swap revenues or losses 
in general  the fair values of individual credit swaps are aggregated by counterparty for presentation in our consolidated statements of financial condition 
if the aggregate total of fair values for a counterparty is a net gain  the total is recorded as a component of unrealized gains on credit swaps  at fair value  in our consolidated statements of financial condition 
if the aggregate total of fair values for a counterparty is a net loss  the total is recorded as a component of unrealized losses on credit swaps  at fair value  in our consolidated statements of financial condition 
aggregation by counterparty is applied where an executed isda master agreement is in place with the counterparty 
in instances where we do not yet ha ve an executed isda master agreement with the counterparty  the fair values of individual swap transactions are recorded as components of unrealized gains or losses on credit swaps  at fair value  dependent upon whether the individual contract was at a gain or a loss 
as of december   we had no outstanding credit swaps with any counterparties with whom we had not yet executed isda master agreements 
primus financial and prs trading strategies each enter into a valid isda master agreement with each of their counterparties 
as a general rule  when primus financial sells credit swaps  it is our intention to maintain the transaction until maturity 
however  there are two sets of circumstances in which we could elect to terminate transactions prior to maturity  and we monitor our portfolio on a continuing basis to assess whether those circumstances are present 
first  whenever we receive new information suggesting that the credit quality of the underlying risk has deteriorated to a material degree  we consider the possibility of terminating the transaction  
table of contents usually at a loss  to avoid a larger loss that could result if the credit swap were to remain in place until a credit event occurs 
the principal factor that governs our decision regarding termination in these circumstances is whether we believe that the underlying risk has become substantially greater than the level of risk we would choose to assume in entering into a new sale of credit swaps 
since inception  we have terminated due to credit considerations less than of the notional amount of credit swaps sold 
second  we may elect to terminate a transaction for reasons other than credit considerations 
terminations of this type may generate gains or losses 
in making a decision to terminate a transaction for reasons other than credit considerations  we consider a number of different factors  including the absolute amount of the unrealized gain or loss we could realize  the likelihood of additional gains or losses arising from the position  our view as to whether the capital dedicated to the position could be profitably reallocated to other opportunities over a foreseeable horizon  the total size of our portfolio in relation to our capital and the total size of our swap positions and exposures with a particular counterparty 
we refer to terminations effected under these circumstances as resizing or rebalancing 
since inception  we have terminated approximately of credit swaps under which we sold credit swaps based on resizing or rebalancing considerations 
we may terminate a credit swap in one of two ways 
we may negotiate an agreed termination through the original counterparty an unwind 
we may negotiate an assignment and novation of our rights and obligations under the credit swap to a third party an assignment 
as an alternative to terminating a transaction  we may enter into an equal and opposite transaction with a third party under which we purchase credit swaps on terms that match the terms of the original transaction an offset 
in this last case  both sides of the position may subsequently be unwound or assigned 
in the event of an unwind or assignment  we pay or receive a cash settlement negotiated with the counterparty or assignee  based on the fair value of the credit swap contract and the accrued premium on the swap contract at the time of negotiation 
the amounts we pay or receive are recorded as a realization of fair value and as a realization of accrued premiums in the period in which the termination occurs 
in the past  we purchased a limited amount of credit swaps as short term investments  and incurred the cost of paying premiums until the purchased swaps were terminated 
we undertook these transactions with the expectation that the market credit swap premium level for the reference entity would rise subsequent to our purchase of swaps and that we would be able to terminate the swap at a realized net gain 
we did not achieve the results we expected from this strategy and wound down the portfolio to zero during the last quarter of during  prs trading strategies traded in a broad range of fixed income products  including credit default swaps  leveraged loans and investment grade and speculative grade debt securities  among others 
in addition  prs trading strategies entered into total return swap transactions  under which prs trading strategies receives interest and other payments based on certain mutually agreed reference loans  and pays a financing interest expense based on the principal amount of such loans 
prs trading strategies takes the risk that the referenced loans deteriorate in value and conversely receives the benefit from any appreciation in the value of loans referenced in each total return swap 
prs trading strategies earned trading reven ues in connection with loans accumulated in connection with primus clo i  in the warehouse period before the clo was launched 
a major financial institution provided funding for the loans accumulated in the warehouse and prs trading strategies and the major financial institution agreed to share equally in the net interest earned on the loans  after deduction of funding costs paid to the major financial institution 
prs trading strategies and a major financial institution also agreed to share equally in any gains or losses arising from the sale of loans during the warehouse period  although there was limited recourse to prs trading strategies 
clo transaction and warehouse loan agreements on december   the company completed its first clo offering through primus clo i  ltd a special purpose entity or spe 
primus asset management is acting as collateral manager of the clo 
under the terms of the collateral management agreement of the clo  primus asset 
table of contents management will receive management fees quarterly for managing the selection  acquisition and disposition of the underlying collateral and for monitoring the underlying collateral 
the company has invested million for a equity portion of the clo 
the company s ultimate exposure to loss in the clo is limited to the amount of its equity investment in the clo 
prior to the closure of the company s clo  the company s subsidiaries  primus asset management and prs trading strategies entered into a credit agreement together with certain other related agreements  hereafter referred to as the warehouse loan agreements with a major financial institution and the special purpose entity 
during the warehouse period  the special purpose entity accumulates a portfolio of loan assets  and subsequently issues securities in the form of a collateralized loan obligation 
under the terms of the agreements  the spe was able to finance the purchase and accumulation of loans to an amount up to million 
each time the company is involved in a clo transaction  the company performs an analysis to determine whether it is the primary beneficiary and accordingly  would be required to consolidate the spe in its consolidated financial statements 
the company has determined  that it is not the primary beneficiary of primus clo i  ltd 
and  accordingly  the spe is not consolidated in the company s financial statements 
revenue generated from the warehouse loan agreements is recorded in other trading revenues  as presented in the consolidated statements of operations  and comprises the company s share of net realized losses on the termination of individual loan positions and net interest earned on the warehouse loans 
income taxes primus guaranty  prs trading strategies  primus bermuda and primus financial are not expected to be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business in the united states and as a result are not expected to be subject to united states federal  state or local income tax 
primus asset management is a united states domiciled corporation and is subject to united states federal  state and local income tax on its income  including on fees received from primus financial 
primus re may be subject to united states federal  state or local income tax  or primus asset management may be required to include all or part of primus re s income in calculating its liability for united states federal  state or local income tax  depending on the manner in which primus re conducts its business and the tax elections it makes 
the maximum combined rate of united states corporate federal  state and local income tax that could apply to primus financial or primus bermuda  were they found to be engaged in a united states business in new york city and subject to income tax  is approximately not including united states branch profits tax that would be imposed on primus bermuda were primus financial deemed to be making distributions to primus bermuda 
for united states federal income tax purposes  primus guaranty and primus bermuda are likely to be treated as pfics 
critical accounting policies valuation of credit swaps from the inception of our business  we have applied statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas   accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
sfas requires recognition of all credit swaps on the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value 
the fair value of the credit swaps depends on a number of factors  primarily the market level of credit swap premiums associated with individual reference entities 
credit swaps are valued using market standard pricing models which calculate the net present value of differences between future premiums on currently quoted market credit swaps and the contractual future credit swap premiums on contracts we have undertaken 
our pricing model has been internally developed but is benchmarked against a market standard model 
generally  our model uses quoted market credit swap premium data that we purchase from an independent pricing service 
this service takes pricing 
table of contents information from a number of prominent dealers and brokers in the credit swap market across a range of standard maturities and restructuring terms  and creates average mid market credit swap premium quotes on specific reference entities 
we adjust the mid market pricing we receive from the pricing service to reflect an estimate of the cost to close the position 
we believe there are a variety of factors that may influence market credit swap premium levels 
the principal factor is the market s view of the probability that a reference entity will default over the multi year horizon typical for a credit swap contract 
those views in turn are influenced by the state of the economy  the outlook for corporate financial health in general as well as the outlook for particular industries and companies 
additional factors include the magnitude of debt outstanding and debt paying capacity within those same industries and companies 
one factor specific to the credit swap market is the capacity of credit swap market participants to sell credit swaps 
if  for example  commercial banks are activel y buying protection to manage their regulatory capital  this will tend  other factors being equal  to absorb the capacity of protection sellers and cause an increase in market credit swap premiums 
conversely  creation of special purpose vehicles that sell protection create additional protection seller capacity and  absent additional demand  can cause a decrease in market premiums 
absent rapid and steep changes  interest rates have  at most  a limited effect on market credit swap premium levels 
share based employee compensation plans effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee options and other forms of equity compensation based on estimated fair values 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company used the fair value approach for recording share based employee compensation in accordance with the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for share based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for share based compensation transition and disclosure 
the approach to accounting for share based payments in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas  therefore  there were no material changes made to our recognition method upon adoption of sfas no 
r 
under the fair value method  share based compe nsation expense had been recognized in our results of operations in prior periods 
compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of options  performance shares  restricted shares and restricted share units rsu as determined on the date of grant and is being expensed over the related vesting period 
the fair value of the options granted is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company continues to apply the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for share awards as it deems it to be the most appropriate model 
the use of the black scholes model requires certain estimates for values of variables used in the model 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview our net income for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in net income during was primarily due to the mark to market unrealized gains on credit swaps from the portfolio of credit swaps sold by primus financial  compared with unrealized losses in the portfolio in interest income on our portfolio of investments was million in  compared with million in the increase is due to higher market interest rates  together with increased invested balances  mainly arising from the investment of the proceeds of the million debt issuance by primus financial in december

net unrealized gains losses on primus financial s credit swaps were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change in unrealized gains 
table of contents losses on credit swaps reflects the change in the fair value of our credit swap portfolio during these periods

included in the year ended december   was a credit of approximately thousand related to a reduction in share compensation expense as a result of employee departures 
compensation expense for the year ended december  included approximately thousand related to the accelerated compensation expenses and accelerated vesting of shares related to the departure of former employees 
our accrued cash incentive compensation expense was mill ion for the year ended december   compared with an accrued expense of million in the corresponding year of share compensation expense was approximately million for both years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in professional fees is primarily related to increased provisions for legal fees and employee recruiting costs 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is due to the increase in purchases of fixed assets and higher capitalized software costs 
the increase in technology and data expense was primarily attributable to the expansion of our technology platform to accommodate new trading strategies associated with our asset management build out 
the increase in other expenses was primarily due to travel related costs and occupancy expenses associated with the additional office space in new york and london 
interest expense and preferred distributions for the years ended december  and  we incurred million and million of interest expense  respectively

primus guaranty had a net deferred tax asset  fully offset by a valuation allowance  of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the change in the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance resulted primarily from primus asset management s estimated net operating loss 
it is expected that only the income of primus asset management and its subsidiary  primus re  are likely to be subject to united states federal and local income taxes 
however  were primus bermuda to be subject to income tax  at a combined united states federal  new york state and new york city income tax rate of  on its united states gaap income  then its income tax expense excluding interest and penalties would have been approximately million and approximately million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these figures assume that primus financial is not deemed to be making distributions to primus bermuda  such distributions would subject primus bermuda to an additional united states federal branch profits tax 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  on a us gaap basis  we had net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reduction in net income in was primarily driven by unrealized losses on our portfolio of credit swaps sold  coupled with losses realized from the early termination of credit swaps 
these reductions in revenues were offset in part by increased premium revenues from a larger credit swap portfolio and higher interest income

premium income on credit swaps sold increased primarily as a result of the expansion in our credit swap portfolio 
the quarterly average notional amounts outstanding of credit swaps sold were billion and billion in and  respectively 
we began to sell protection in tranche format during the second quarter of  whereby we sell credit swaps referencing portfolios containing obligations of multiple reference entities 
premium income from the tranche sold was thousand for the year ended december   and the notional amount outstanding was million at december  the premium expense on credit swaps purchased as short term investments was million and thousand for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   we had no outstanding credit swaps purchased as short term investments  whereas the notional amount outstanding at december  was million 
the average outstanding balance was higher during than in  resulting in higher premium expense in the notional amounts of credit swaps that we had purchased to offset credit risk on certain credit swaps sold were and million at december  and net realized gains losses on credit swaps primus financial s business strategy is generally to hold swaps we sell until maturity 
however  there are circumstances in which we may terminate a credit swap prior to maturity  either as a result of credit considerations or portfolio rebalancing considerations 
we cannot identify at the outset of any credit swap transaction whether the credit swap will be terminated or otherwise disposed of prior to its maturity 
if the credit swaps we terminate are at attractive market values  we are able to realize gains 
in certain circumstances we will terminate a credit swap at a realized loss 
in general  we terminate credit swaps at a loss where we perceive that the credit quality of the underlying reference entity risk has deteriorated  and we wish to reduce or eliminate our exposure to the reference entity 
we may also terminate a credit swap at a loss in order to create opportunities to rebalance our exposure to a reference entity 

table of contents we terminated million and million notional amount of credit swaps sold during the years ended december  and  respectively 
net realized gains losses on the early termination of credit swaps sold were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net realized losses incurred during were primarily the result of our decision to mitigate our exposure to a limited number of reference entities  which had become the subject of leveraged buy outs  which increased the credit risk of those reference entities 
in the past we also purchased credit protection as a short term investment  and  in that case  early termination of the credit swaps was a fundamental part of our business strategy 
in the course of  we terminated the portfolio of swaps purchased as short term investments because results had not met our expectations 
we terminated million and million notional amount of credit swaps purchased during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we realized a net loss of million and a net gain of million from the early termination of credit swaps purchased as short term investments for the years ended december  and  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for gains or losses that may result from changes in the value of a financial instrument as a consequence of changes in market conditions 
our primary market risk is changes in market credit swap premium levels  which increase or decrease the fair value of our credit swap portfolio 
market credit swap premium levels change as a result of specific events or news related to a reference entity  such as a change in a credit rating by any of the rating agencies 
additionally  market credit swap premium levels can vary as a result of changes in market sentiment 
as a general matter  given our strategy of holding credit swaps sold until maturity  we do not seek to manage our overall exposure to market credit swap premium levels  and we expect fluctuations in the fair value of our credit swap portfolio as a result of these changes 
as of december   each one basis point increase or decrease in market credit swap premiums would decrease or increase the fair value of our credit swap portfolio by approximately million 
we face other market risks  which are likely to have a lesser impact upon our net income than those associated with market credit swap premium level risk 
these other risks include interest rate risk associated with market interest rate movements 
these movements may affect the value of our credit swap portfolio as our pricing model includes an interest rate component  which is used to discount future expected cash flows 
interest rate 
table of contents movements may also affect the carrying value of and yield on our investments 
the primus financial cumulative preferred shares pays distributions that are based upon the auction rate preferred market 
a difference between the rates we pay in the auction rate preferred market and the interest rates we receive on our investments may result in an additional cost to our company 
assuming that auction results with respect to the primus financial cumulative preferred shares reflect prevailing short term interest rates  each basis point increase or decrease in the level of those rates would increase or decrease primus financial s annual distribution cost by approximately  for each of the series a and series b mmp receipts  but would not affect distributions on the series b mmp receipts as the interest and auction rate for such mmp receipts were set for a one year period on january  in addition  interest rate movements may increase or decrease the interest expense we incur on our mi llion of subordinated deferrable interest notes 
a basis point increase in the level of those rates would increase primus financial s interest expense by  annually 
counterparty risk represents the potential for loss should one or more of our counterparties be unable to meet its obligations due to bankruptcy or a similar event  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
our counterparties generally have investment grade credit ratings 
at december   the notional and fair value amount of credit swaps outstanding with respect to one non rated counterparty were million and thousand  respectively 
the premiums on these transactions were fully prepaid by the counterparty  and as such  they have been categorized as aaa aaa rating in our credit swap portfolio
