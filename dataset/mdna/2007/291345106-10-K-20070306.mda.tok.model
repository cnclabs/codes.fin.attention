item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and the information described under the caption risk factors and special note regarding forward looking statements above 
general emisphere technologies  inc is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the oral delivery of therapeutic macromolecules and other compounds that are not currently deliverable by oral means 
since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to research and development conducted on our own behalf and in collaborations with corporate partners and academic research institutions 
our product pipeline includes product candidates for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases  osteoarthritis  osteoporosis  growth disorders  diabetes  asthma allergies  obesity  infectious diseases and oncology 
development and commercialization of these product candidates entails risk and significant expense 
since inception  we have had no product sales from these product candidates 
oral heparin and oral insulin are our two lead unpartnered programs 
during  we will continue to develop plans for advancing these two programs 
our strategy for the heparin program includes plans for a pivotal  phase iii trial designed to determine the safety and efficacy of oral heparin versus coumadin sodium warfarin for the prevention of venous thromboembolism following elective total hip replacement 
in further support of the heparin program  during the third quarter of we conducted a multi arm  cross over  clinical trial with sixteen subjects to compare heparin delivered by different injection routes to heparin delivered orally in normal subjects 
in march  we announced that preliminary results confirmed that heparin delivered orally utilizing our eligen drug delivery technology is chemically identical to heparin delivered by injection 
we have discussed the data with the fda and are able to proceed to a phase iii study  however we are clarifying with the fda a few remaining details with regard to the phase iii study protocol prior to its finalization 
during the fall of  we announced the results of our day phase ii trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of low and high doses of oral insulin tablets utilizing our eligen drug delivery technology 
the four arm study evaluated the safety and efficacy of low and high fixed does of oral insulin tablets verses placebo in patients with type diabetes mellitus on existing oral metformin monotherapy 
the trial focused on the safety of oral insulin  specifically noting incidents of hypoglycemia  as well as the occurrence of insulin antibodies 
the efficacy component of the trial was designed to measure changes in hemoglobin ac hbac over days  the standard for evaluating glucose control in type ii diabetics 
an additional objective was to confirm that insulin delivered orally could be administered as a fixed dose product without the need to conduct glucose monitoring or titrate the insulin dose 
we are planning additional clinical studies related to the dosage form development designed to optimize efficiency of delivery 
in order to design the appropriate clinical studies for the development of the product  we are establishing a scientific advisory board comprised of leading academic experts in the field of diabetes 
we also plan to continue to advance our collaboration with novartis on salmon calcitonin  oral pht and recombinant human growth hormone  with genta on oral gallium  and with a pharmaceutical company based outside the united states to develop an improved oral formulation of the antiviral compound acyclovir 
our collaboration with roche on small molecule compounds for bone related diseases was terminated after notice received in november liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have generated significant losses from operations and we anticipate that we will continue to generate significant losses from operations for the foreseeable future 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million and our stockholders deficit was million 
our operating loss was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  after receipts of collaboration and feasibility payments of million  million and million  respectively which do not occur with regularity or at all 
we believe operating loss is a more representative measure to discuss  as net loss of million for the year ended december  includes million of non cash other expense items related to a beneficial conversion feature and derivatives 
we have limited capital resources and operations to date have been funded primarily with the proceeds from collaborative research agreements  public and private equity and debt financings and income earned on investments 
as of december   total cash  cash equivalents and investments were million 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources  without implementing cost reductions  raising additional capital  or obtaining substantial cash inflows from potential partners for our products  will enable us to continue operations through approximately september however  this expectation is based on the current operating plan that could change as a result of many factors and additional funding may be required sooner than anticipated 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the audit report prepared by our independent registered public accounting firm relating to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our business will require substantial additional investment that we have not yet secured 
while our plan is to raise capital when needed and or to pursue partnering opportunities  we cannot be sure how much we will need to spend in order to develop  market and manufacture new products and technologies in the future 
we expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on research and development  including amounts spent on conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
further  we will not have sufficient resources to develop fully any new products or technologies unless we are able to raise substantial additional financing on acceptable terms or secure funds from new or existing partners 
we cannot assure you that financing will be available on favorable terms or at all 
our failure to raise capital when needed would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  and could force us to reduce or cease our operations 
if additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
during the year ended december   our cash liquidity consisting of cash  restricted cash and short term investments increased as follows cash  restricted cash and investments in thousands at december  at december  increase in cash and investments the increase in cash and investments is comprised of the following components for the years ended december in thousands proceeds  net  from issuance of equity securities proceeds from issuance of note payable proceeds from collaboration and other projects proceeds from sale of fixed assets proceeds from collection of ceo note receivable gain on sale of investment sources of cash cash used in operations grossed up for collaborations repayment of debts and capital expenditures applications of cash increase decrease in cash and investments during the year ended december   our working capital liquidity increased by million as follows december  change in thousands current assets current liabilities working capital the increase in current assets is driven primarily by the increase in cash and investments 
the decrease in current liabilities is driven largely by decreases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities million 
the lease for our principal executive  administrative and laboratory facilities was set to expire on august  on march   we exercised the first extension option under the existing lease for our premises for a term of five years 
fixed rent payable under the extension shall be at an annul rate equal to of the fair market rental for the premises 
the fair market rental for the premises will be determined by the landlord 
under the existing lease terms  we have the right to dispute the landlords determination  in which instance an arbitration process will commence 
financing activities during  we received a million milestone payment from novartis on the oral recombinant human growth hormone rhgh program 
also during  we received million through the issuance of common stock and derivative instruments  including million from the may offering of million shares of our common stock and warrants  million from the exercise of warrants and stock options and million from the purchase of warrants 
mhr was a purchaser in this offering 
during  we received net proceeds of approximately million under a million secured loan agreement the loan agreement executed with mhr 
under the loan agreement  mhr requested  and on may   we effected  the exchange of the loan from mhr for senior secured convertible notes the convertible notes with substantially the same terms as the loan agreement  except that the convertible notes are convertible  at the sole discretion of mhr  into shares of our common stock at a price per share of 
the convertible notes are due on september   bear interest at and are secured by a first priority lien in favor of mhr on substantially all of our assets 
interest is payable in the form of additional convertible notes rather than in cash and we have the right to call the convertible notes after september  if certain conditions are satisfied 
further  the convertible notes provide mhr with the right to require redemption in the event of a change in control  as defined  prior to september  the convertible notes provide for various events of default 
if an event of default occurs  the convertible notes provide for the immediate repayment and certain additional amounts as set forth in the convertible notes 
we have received a waiver from mhr  through march  for certain defaults under the agreement 
additionally  mhr was granted certain registration rights 
in connection with the mhr financing  the company agreed to appoint a representative of mhr mhr nominee and another person the mutual director to its board of directors 
further  the company has amended its certificate of incorporation to provide for continuity of the mhr nominee and the mutual nominee on the board  as described therein  so long as mhr holds at least of the outstanding common stock of the company 
on december  we received million in exchange for issuance of a convertible note to novartis the novartis note in connection with a new research collaboration option relating to the development of pth the novartis note is convertible  at our option  at any time prior to maturity on december  into a number of shares of our common stock equal to the principal and accrued and unpaid interest divided by the then market price of our common stock  provided certain conditions are met 
the novartis note bears interest at a rate of until december   from then until december   and from that point until maturity on december  we have the option to pay interest in cash on a current basis or accrue the periodic interest as an addition to the principal amount of the novartis note 
we are accruing interest which is being recorded using the effective interest rate method  which results in a level interest rate of 
in  we entered into a joint venture with elan to develop oral heparin 
in connection with the re purchase of elan s joint venture interest in  we issued a zero coupon note the original elan note to elan 
the original elan note had an issue price of million and an original issue discount at maturity of million and a maturity date of july  on december   we entered into a security purchase agreement with elan  providing for our purchase of indebtness to elan under the original elan note 
the value of the original elan note plus accrued interest on december  was approximately million 
pursuant to the security purchase agreement  we paid elan million and issued to elan  shares of our common stock with a market price of approximately million 
also  we issued elan a new zero coupon note with an issue price of approximately million the modified elan note  representing the accrued value of the original elan note minus the sum of the cash payment and the value of the  shares 
in  we issued elan a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of and made a million payment to elan  which completed our repurchase of our indebtness to elan 
overview of operations during we continued to make progress on our internally funded heparin and insulin projects 
in heparin  we demonstrated that heparin delivered orally utilizing our eligen drug delivery technology is chemically identical to heparin delivered by injection 
we also submitted the protocol for a special protocol assessment spa to the fda in and received comments in january we are continuing our discussions with the fda on heparin 
for insulin  we completed a phase ii study which evaluated the safety and efficacy of low and high doses of oral insulin tablets utilizing our eligen drug delivery technology 
efforts on these two projects are planned to continue in we also continued our collaborations in we collaborated with novartis on oral recombinant human growth hormone rhgh  oral salmon calcitonin sct and oral recombinant parathyroid hormone pth  which resulted in a milestone payment of million related to rhgh 
we entered into a collaboration agreement with genta in march  which resulted in reimbursement of fees of approximately million 
our collaboration agreement with roche relating to the small molecule to treat bone disease generated a million milestone payment in  but the program was cancelled after notice received in november we are currently working on various feasibility studies with pharmaceutical companies including roche to develop other uses for our carrier 
in february  novartis pharma ag and its development partner nordic bioscience notified us of the initiation of a phase iii clinical trial for the treatment of osteoporosis with an oral form of salmon calcitonin referred to as smc  a new drug candidate  using the company s eligen delivery technology 
as a result of the initiation of the trial  we will be entitled to receive a milestone payment from novartis of million as well as reimbursement for approximately million in costs 
our current plans include moving our oral heparin program into phase iii development in this would involve increases in human resources and clinical costs associated with such studies to the extent that such costs are not absorbed by partners 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  change in thousands revenue operating expenses operating loss beneficial conversion of convertible security change in fair value of derivative instruments gain on extinguishment of note payable net loss revenue increased significantly as compared to as a result of the million milestone payment received from novartis for rhgh 
operating expenses decreased by million as a result of the following items in thousands increase in human resource costs reduction in clinical costs and lab fees reduction in professional fees all other net reduction human resource costs increased by million primarily as a result of the implementation of fas r in  which resulted in an additional cost of million that did not occur in this increase was partially offset by a reduction in employees in research and development and in general and administration during clinical costs and lab fees decreased as the heparin and insulin trials that began in came to a conclusion in the reduction of million in professional fees is related to a decrease in legal expenses in as compared to in  we experienced higher than normal legal fees as a result of the lilly litigation  the re negotiation of the ceo s employment contract  and the mhr note 
the charge for beneficial conversion in is due to the conversion feature in the mhr notes  which did not exist until the change in the fair value of the derivatives instruments increased primarily due to change in the stock price over the years and the issuance of  shares under warrants that were exercised 
additionally  we converted mhr s warrant purchase option into warrants for  shares 
the gain on the extinguishment of the note payable of debt is related to the repurchase of our indebtedness to elan in  which is considered a troubled debt restructuring 
as a result of the above factors  we sustained a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  these results include a number of non recurring transactions the increase in revenue  the charge for the beneficial conversion in  and the gain on the extinguishment of the note payable to elan in  and are therefore not necessarily indicative of future results 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  change in thousands revenue operating expenses operating loss gain on extinguishment of note payable interest expense net loss revenue increased significantly as compared to primarily as a result of the new collaboration signed with roche related to the small molecule for bone disease in the second half of the product being developed under the roche agreement entered phase i clinical trials in the second quarter of  triggering a milestone payment of million under the agreement 
operating expenses increased million as a result of the following items in thousands increase in professional fees increase in clinical costs increase in utility costs decrease in lab fees and lab supplies gain on sale of fixed assets all other net increase professional fees increased primarily as a result of the increase in consulting and accounting fees as a result of the implementation of certain requirements relating to the sarbanes oxley act of sox in the increase in clinical costs is the result of an increase of million in clinical trial activity  specifically  completion of the heparin is heparin trial and the initiation of the phase ii insulin trial in india 
additionally  expenses were lowered by the receipt of a million credit upon completion of the final reconciliation of payments related to the protect liquid oral heparin trials 
utility costs increased by million due to higher energy costs and an increase in the allocated common charges from the landlord 
the decrease in outside laboratory analysis fees and lab supplies reflects a progression from pre clinical to clinical activities 
the million gain on sale of fixed assets relates to the sale of the farmington  connecticut research facility 
the gain on the extinguishment of the note payable of debt is related to the repurchase of our indebtedness to elan in  which is considered a troubled debt restructuring 
interest expense decreased by million due to the repayment of the note payable to elan  which was repaid in the first quarter of interest expense for included million of interest related to the note payable to elan 
as a result of the above factors  we sustained a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  these results include a number of non recurring transactions the increase in revenue  the gain on the extinguishment of the note payable to elan  and the gains on the sales of fixed assets and investments and are therefore not necessarily indicative of future results 
critical accounting estimates and new accounting pronouncements critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
share based payments on january   we adopted sfas r  share based payment  which establishes standards for share based transactions in which an entity receives employee s services for a equity instruments of the entity  such as stock options  or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r supersedes the option of accounting for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and requires that companies expense the fair value of stock options and similar awards  as measured on the awards grant date 
sfas r applies to all awards granted after the date of adoption  and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after that date 
we have elected to apply sfas r using a modified version of prospective application  under which compensation cost is recognized only for the portion of awards outstanding for which the requisite service has not been rendered as of the adoption date  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas for pro forma disclosures 
we estimate the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model the black scholes model 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  expected term  risk free interest rate  expected dividends and expected forfeiture rates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under sfas r 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
employee stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
during the year ended december   we do not believe that reasonable changes in the projections would have had a material effect on share based compensation expense 
revenue recognition revenue includes amounts earned from collaborative agreements and feasibility studies 
revenue from collaboration agreements is recognized using the lower of the percentage complete applied to expected contractual payments or the total non refundable cash received to date 
revenue from feasibility studies  which are typically short term in nature  is recognized upon delivery of the study  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
changes in the projected hours to complete the project could significantly change the amount of revenue recognized 
during the year ended december   we do not believe that reasonable changes in the projections would have had a material effect on recorded revenue 
purchased technology purchased technology represents the value assigned to patents and the rights to use  sell or license certain technology in conjunction with heparin 
these assets underlie our research and development projects related to solid oral heparin  and if the projects prove unsuccessful  the assets have no alternative future use 
cash flow projections for our potential heparin product greatly exceed the million book value of purchased technology 
however  if a competitor were to gain fda approval for an oral heparin product before us or future clinical trials related to oral heparin failed to meet the targeted endpoints  we would likely record an impairment related to these assets 
warrants warrants issued in connection with the kingsbridge common stock purchase agreement  the equity financing completed in march and to mhr have been classified as liabilities due to certain provisions that may require cash settlement in certain circumstances 
at each balance sheet date  we adjust the warrants to reflect their current fair value 
we estimate the fair value of these instruments using the black scholes option pricing model which takes into account a variety of factors  including historical stock price volatility  risk free interest rates  remaining term and the closing price of our common stock 
changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these derivative instruments could result in a material change in the fair value of the instruments 
we believe the assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the warrants are reasonable 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information on the volatility in market value of derivative instruments 
equipment and leasehold improvements equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization are provided for on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or of the improvements  whichever is shorter 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not materially extend the useful lives of the respective assets are charged to expense as incurred 
the cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts and any gain or loss is recognized in operations 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value  is triggered if the carrying amount exceeds estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates  which would result in additional impairment losses or losses on disposal of the assets 
during the years ended december   and  we did not recognize any significant impairment losses 
clinical trial accrual methodology clinical trial expenses represent obligations resulting from our contracts with various research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
we account for those expenses on an accrual basis according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient enrollment and the timing of the various aspects of the trial 
accruals are recorded in accordance with the following methodology i the costs for period expenses  such as investigator meetings and initial start up costs  are expensed as incurred based on management s estimates  which are impacted by any change in the number of sites  number of patients and patient start dates  ii direct service costs  which are primarily on going monitoring costs  are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the contract  and iii principal investigator expenses that are directly associated with recruitment are recognized based on actual patient recruitment 
all changes to the contract amounts due to change orders are analyzed and recognized in accordance with the above methodology 
change orders are triggered by changes in the scope  time to completion and the number of sites 
during the course of a trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
sab no 
requires registrants to quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements using the rollover method  which focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement and the iron curtain method  which focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the prior end balance sheet 
the use of both of these methods is referred to as the dual approach and should be combined with the evaluation of qualitative elements surrounding the errors in accordance with sab no 
 materiality 
the provisions of sab no 
became effective for us in the current fiscal year 
the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for us for fiscal years beginning january  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
in june  the fasb published fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for us in fiscal years beginning january  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements with third parties that include indemnification provisions which  in our judgment  are normal and customary for companies in our industry sector 
these agreements are typically with business partners  clinical sites  and suppliers 
pursuant to these agreements  we generally agree to indemnify  hold harmless  and reimburse indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified parties with respect to our product candidates  use of such product candidates  or other actions taken or omitted by us 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
we have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions 
as a result  the estimated fair value of liabilities relating to these provisions is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these provisions as of december  in the normal course of business  we may be confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability 
these generally relate to lawsuits  claims  environmental actions or the actions of various regulatory agencies 
we consult with counsel and other appropriate experts to assess the claim 
if  in our opinion  we have incurred a probable loss as set forth by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
after consultation with legal counsel  we do not anticipate that liabilities arising out of currently pending or threatened lawsuits and claims  including the pending litigation described in part i  item legal proceedings  will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
contractual arrangements significant contractual obligations as of december  are as follows amount due in type of obligation total less than year to years to years more than years in thousands long term debt derivative liabilities operating lease obligations clinical research organizations total amounts include both principal and related interest payments 
in december  we issued a million convertible note payable to novartis the novartis note due december interest may be paid annually or accreted as additional principal 
we may convert the novartis note at any time prior to maturity into a number of shares of our common stock equal to the principal and accrued and unpaid interest to be converted divided by the then market price of our common stock  provided certain conditions are met 
upon the occurrence of an event of default prior to conversion  or within six months of conversion  any unpaid principal and accrued interest on the novartis note would become immediately due and payable 
at december   the balance on the novartis note was million 
we have outstanding million in convertible notes payable to mhr and its affiliates mhr due september and convertible at the sole discretion of mhr into shares of our common stock at a price of 
interest at is payable in additional convertible notes rather than in cash and we have the right to call the convertible notes after september  if certain conditions are satisfied 
the convertible notes are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of certain events of default 
we have issued warrants to purchase shares of our common stock which contain provisions requiring us to make a cash payment to the holders of the warrant for any gain that could have been realized if the holders exercise the warrants and we subsequently fail to deliver a certificate representing the shares to be issued upon such exercise by the third trading day after such warrants have been exercised 
as a result  these warrants have been recorded at their fair value and are classified as current liabilities 
the value and timing of the actual cash payments  if any  related to these derivative instruments could differ materially from the amounts and periods shown 
the lease for our principal executive  administrative and laboratory facilities was set to expire on august  on march   we exercised the first extension option under the existing lease for our premises for a term of five years 
fixed rent payable under the extension shall be at an annul rate equal to of the fair market rental for the premises 
the fair market rental for the premises will be determined by the landlord 
under the existing lease terms  we have the right to dispute the landlords determination  in which instance an arbitration process will commence 
for the year ended december   rental expense  including real estate taxes and common maintenance charges totaled approximately million 
the table above reflects our committment through august   as we were not obligated under the lease extension at december  we are obligated to make payments under certain contracts with third parties who provide clinical research services to support our ongoing research and development 
in april  the company entered into an employment contract with its then chief executive officer  dr 
michael m 
goldberg  for services through july  on january   our board of directors terminated dr 
goldberg s services 
the company continues to discuss the terms of dr 
goldberg s separation from the company 
dr 
goldberg s employment agreement provides  among other things  that in the event he is terminated without cause  dr 
goldberg would be paid his base salary plus bonus aggregating approximately million  if any  monthly for an eighteen month period  and he would also be entitled to continued health and life insurance coverage during the severance period and all unvested stock options and restricted stock awards would immediately vest in full upon such termination 
dr 
goldberg s employment agreement provides that in the event he is terminated with cause he will receive no additional compensation 
on march   dr 
goldberg  through his counsel  advised of his intent to file suit against the company in this matter as well as his intent to seek punitive damages 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fair value of warrants and derivative liabilities 
at december   the value of derivative instruments was million 
we estimate the fair values of these instruments using the black scholes option pricing model which takes into account a variety of factors  including historical stock price volatility  risk free interest rates  remaining term and the closing price of our common stock 
we are required to revalue this liability each quarter 
we believe that the assumption that has the greatest impact on the determination of fair value is the closing price of our common stock 
the following table illustrates the potential effect on the fair value of derivative instruments from changes in the assumptions made increase decrease in thousands increase in stock price increase in stock price increase in assumed volatility decrease in stock price decrease in stock price decrease in assumed volatility investments 
our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while maximizing yield without significantly increasing risk 
our investments may consist of commercial paper  mortgage backed securities  and auction rate securities 
our fixed rate interest bearing investments totaled million at december  this investment matures in one to two years 
we have classified all investments as short term based on our intent to liquidate the investments to fund operations over the upcoming twelve month period 
due to the conservative nature of our fixed interest rate investment  we do not believe that they have a material exposure to interest rate risk
