we began offering a new line of active wear apparel under the sport catalog title in august this apparel represents a small but important portion of the overall merchandise mix 
while this merchandise has been well received by customers  the sport title was discontinued in the third quarter of fiscal select sport merchandise has been incorporated into the existing assortments across all channels 
approximately million catalogs were mailed in fiscal compared to the approximately million mailed in fiscal we currently plan to mail approximately million catalogs in fiscal the largest increase in circulation will be in the coldwater creek catalog  as growth in the premium retail store base is expected to provide additional circulation opportunities in an increased number of markets 
customer contact centers we have three customer contact centers located in coeur d alene  idaho  mineral wells  west virginia  and sandpoint  idaho 
customer contact center personnel receive comprehensive  ongoing training on the coldwater creek culture  expectations of exceptional customer service  and product knowledge

table of contents competition the women s retail apparel market is highly competitive 
competitors range from specialty apparel retail companies such as ann taylor  chico s and talbots to small single sales channel catalog  e commerce and retail store companies 
we also compete with national department store chains such as macy s  nordstrom  dillard s and jc penney  along with discount retailers that offer women s apparel and accessories  such as kohl s and target 
we believe that we compete principally on the basis of our high quality  distinctive merchandise selection and exceptional customer service 
we also believe that an integrated  multi channel sales strategy enhances our ability to compete in the marketplace by providing convenient access to our merchandise  regardless of our customer s preferred shopping method 
government regulation the direct business is subject to the merchandise mail order rule and related regulations promulgated by the federal trade commission 
while we believe we are in material compliance with these regulations  no assurance can be given that new laws or regulations will not be enacted or adopted which might adversely affect operations 
our multi channel business model subjects us to state and local taxes in numerous jurisdictions  including state income  franchise  and sales and use tax 
we collect these taxes in any jurisdiction in which we have a physical presence 
while we believe we have paid or accrued for all taxes based on our interpretation of applicable law  tax laws are complex and interpretations differ from state to state 
in the past  some taxing jurisdictions have assessed additional taxes and penalties on us  asserting either an error in our calculation or an interpretation of the law that differed from our own 
it is possible that taxing authorities may make additional assessments in the future 
in addition to taxes  penalties and interest  these assessments could cause us to incur legal fees associated with resolving disputes with taxing authorities 
additionally  changes in state and local tax laws  such as temporary changes associated with tax holidays and other programs  require us to make continual changes to our collection and reporting systems that may relate to only one taxing jurisdiction 
if we fail to update our collection and reporting systems in response to these changes  any over collection or under collection of sales taxes could subject us to interest and penalties  as well as private lawsuits and damage to our reputation 
various states have attempted to collect back sales and use taxes from direct marketers whose only contacts with the taxing state are solicitations through the mail or the internet  and whose subsequent delivery of purchased goods is by mail or interstate common carriers 
we may be subject to these attempts in states in which we have no physical presence 
however  the united states supreme court has held that these states  absent congressional legislation  may not impose tax collection obligations on an out of state mail order or internet company 
we anticipate that any legislative changes regarding direct marketers  if adopted  would be applied only on a prospective basis 
many of our products are manufactured outside the united states and are subject to existing or potential duties  tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of products we are allowed to import or increase the cost of such products 
to date  we have not been restricted by quotas in the operation of the business  and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of most of our products 
as we expand retail operations and begin to source more merchandise overseas  business may be impacted by quotas and the imposition of customs duties or tariffs 
we are also subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions  including us retaliation against certain prohibited foreign activities  with respect to our product sourcing 

table of contents employees as of february   we had  full time employees and  part time employees 
during our peak selling season  which includes the months of november and december  we utilize a substantial number of temporary employees 
none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our employee relations to be excellent 
trademarks our registered trademarks include coldwater creek  coldwater creek spirit and the stylized coldwater creek logo 
we believe that our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are instrumental to our ability to market and sustain demand for our merchandise and brand

item a 
risk factors we may be unable to successfully implement our retail store rollout strategy  which could result in significantly lower revenue growth 
the key driver of our growth strategy is the retail store expansion 
as of february   we operated premium retail stores 
we have since opened an additional six stores in the fiscal first quarter for a total of premium retail stores currently in operation 
we plan to open a total of premium retail stores in fiscal we believe we have the potential to grow our retail business to a total of to premium retail stores over the next three to five years 
however  there can be no assurance that these stores will be opened  will be opened in a timely manner  or  if opened  that these stores will be profitable 
the ability to open our planned retail stores depends on our ability to successfully identify or secure premium retail space  negotiate site leases or obtain favorable lease terms for the retail store locations we identify  and prevent construction delays and cost overruns in connection with the build out of new stores 
any miscalculations or shortcomings in the planning and control of the retail growth strategy could materially impact results of operations and financial condition 
the retail store model requires us to incur substantial financial commitments and fixed costs that we will not be able to recover if a store is not successful 
the success of an individual store location depends largely on the success of the lifestyle center or shopping mall where the store is located  and may be influenced by changing customer demographic and buying trends 

table of contents these factors cannot be predicted with complete accuracy 
because we are required to make long term financial commitments when leasing retail store locations  and to incur substantial fixed costs for each store s design  leasehold improvements  fixtures  and information and management systems  it would be costly for us to close a store that does not prove successful 
the day spa test may prove unprofitable and may be abandoned at any time 
we are currently testing our coldwater creek the spa concept in six locations  with plans to open three additional day spas in fiscal all of our day spas have been open for less than one year and we have not formed a conclusion as to the long term prospects for this concept 
to date  however  our day spa test has had a negative impact on our earnings  as we experiment with marketing approaches and gather data regarding the spa business and  in particular  our spa customer 
there is no assurance that the test of this concept will be successful or that we will continue to develop day spas 
factors that could cause us to curtail or abandon the day spa concept include unexpected or increased costs or delays in the concept s development  the potential demands on management resources in developing and testing this new concept  legal and regulatory constraints  the inherent difficulty in forecasting consumer tastes and trends through market research  concept testing or otherwise  and the possibility that we will determine through the performance of our test sites that demand does not meet our expectations  and our inability to fund our day spa concept or its expansion with operating cash as a result of either lower sales from our retail and direct businesses or higher than anticipated costs  or both 
if we were to abandon the day spa concept  we would be required to write off any costs we have capitalized and may incur lease termination costs  which would have a material and adverse effect on results of operations  particularly for the quarter in which a write off is recognized 
we are subject to significant risks associated with our ongoing implementation of major changes to our management information systems 
over the next two years we plan to replace a number of our management information systems that are critical to our operations  including systems such as accounting  human resources  inventory purchasing and management  financial planning  direct segment order processing  and retail segment point of sale systems 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we began the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system to support our increasingly complex business and business processes 
installing and integrating the various components of our management information systems carries substantial operations risk  including loss of data or information  cost overruns  implementation delays  disruption of operations  and our ability to meet regulatory reporting requirements 
demand for our merchandise is difficult to predict and our inability to accurately forecast demand may reduce our gross margins 
customer demand for our merchandise is difficult to predict because it is influenced by factors such as the general economic climate and consumer confidence  as well as by customer preferences which change over time and vary from one geographic region to another 
on average  we begin the design process for apparel nine to ten months before merchandise is available to customers  and we typically begin to make purchase commitments four to eight months in advance 
these lead times make it difficult for us to respond quickly to changes in demand for our products and amplify the consequences of any misjudgments we might make 
if the demand for our merchandise is lower than expected we will be forced to move full price merchandise to clearance  which reduces our gross margins 
over the past few years  we generally have maintained conservative inventory levels  
table of contents making us less vulnerable to sales shortfalls 
however  our inventory levels fluctuate seasonally  and at certain times of the year  such as during this past holiday season  we maintain higher inventory levels and are particularly susceptible to risks related to demand for our merchandise 
if we elect to carry relatively low levels of inventory in anticipation of lower demand and demand is stronger than we anticipated  we may be forced to backorder merchandise in our direct channels or not have merchandise available for sale in our retail stores  which may result in lost sales and lower customer satisfaction 
we may be unable to manage significant increases in the costs associated with the catalog business  which could affect results of operations 
we incur substantial costs associated with catalog mailings  including paper  postage  merchandise acquisition and human resource costs associated with catalog layout and design  production and circulation and increased inventories 
significant increases in us postal service rates and the cost of telecommunications services  paper and catalog production could significantly increase catalog production costs and result in lower profits for the catalog business 
most of the catalog related costs are incurred prior to mailing  and as such we are not able to adjust the costs of a particular catalog mailing to reflect the actual subsequent performance of the catalog 
moreover  customer response rates have been unpredictable in recent years  particularly for mailings to prospective customers 
because the catalog business accounts for a significant portion of total net sales  any performance shortcomings experienced by the catalog business would likely have a material adverse effect on our overall business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
consumer concerns about purchasing items via the internet as well as external or internal infrastructure system failures could negatively impact our e commerce sales or cause us to incur additional costs 
the e commerce business is vulnerable to consumer privacy concerns relating to purchasing items over the internet  security breaches  and failures of internet infrastructure and communications systems 
if consumer confidence in making purchases over the internet declines as a result of privacy or other concerns  e commerce net sales could decline 
we may be required to incur increased costs to address or remedy any system failures or security breaches 
we may be unable to manage expanding operations and the complexities of our multi channel strategy  which could harm results of operations 
during the past few years  with the implementation of a multi channel business model  our overall business has become substantially more complex 
this increasing complexity has resulted and is expected to continue to result in increased demands on managerial  operational and administrative resources and has forced us to develop new expertise 
in order to manage our complex multi channel strategy  we will be required to  among other things improve and integrate our management information systems and controls  including installing new accounting  human resources  financial planning  inventory purchasing and management  direct segment order processing and retail segment point of sale systems  efficiently manage the upgrade of certain equipment at our distribution center  and attract  train and retain qualified personnel  including middle and senior management  and manage an increasing number of employees 
we depend on key vendors for timely and effective sourcing and delivery of our merchandise 
if these vendors are unable to timely fill orders or meet quality standards  we may lose customer sales and our reputation may suffer 
the direct business depends largely on our ability to fulfill orders on a timely basis  and the direct and retail businesses depend largely on our ability to keep appropriate levels of inventory in the distribution center and 
table of contents stores 
as we grow the retail business  we may experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient manufacturing capacity from vendors to produce merchandise 
we generally maintain non exclusive relationships with multiple vendors that manufacture our merchandise 
however  we have no contractual assurances of continued supply  pricing or access to new products  and any vendor could discontinue selling to us at any time 
moreover  a key vendor may become unable to supply our inventory needs due to capacity constraints  financial instability  or otherwise 
if we were required to change vendors or if a key vendor was unable to supply desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on acceptable terms  particularly in light of our recent initiative to consolidate more merchandise purchases with fewer vendors  we could experience delays in filling customer orders or delivering inventory to stores until alternative supply arrangements were secured  which could result in lost sales and a decline in customer satisfaction 
additionally  delays by our vendors in supplying our inventory needs could cause us to incur expensive air freight charges  which would negatively impact our margins 
increasing reliance on foreign vendors will subject us to uncertainties that could impact our cost to source merchandise and delay or prevent merchandise shipments 
we expect to continue to expand our direct sourcing program and to source more merchandise directly from foreign vendors  particularly those located in asia as well as those located in india and central america 
we anticipate that we will be the importer of record on approximately percent of total merchandise purchases during fiscal and on approximately percent by the end of fiscal this will expose us to new and greater risks and uncertainties  the occurrence of which could substantially impact our ability to source merchandise through foreign vendors and to realize any perceived cost savings 
we will be subject to  among other things burdens associated with doing business overseas  including the imposition of  or increases in  tariffs or import duties  or import export controls or regulation  as well as credit assurances we are required to provide to foreign vendors  declines in the relative value of the us dollar to foreign currencies  failure of foreign vendors to adhere to our quality assurance standards or our standards for conducting business  financial instability of a vendor or vendors  changing or uncertain economic conditions  political uncertainties or unrest  or epidemics or other health or weather related events in foreign countries resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries  and restrictions on the transfer of funds or transportation delays or interruptions 
the united states and the european union have imposed trade quotas on certain apparel and textile categories from the peoples republic of china 
the memorandum of understanding between the united states and the peoples republic of china  which outlines the new quotas  will be in effect through december our sourcing strategy is designed to allow us to adjust to potential shifts in availability of apparel following the expiration of quotas for world trade organization member countries  and the re imposition of quotas for apparel and textiles exported from the peoples republic of china 
however  sourcing operations may be adversely affected by trade limits  political and or financial instability resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries  significant fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  and or other trade disruptions 
we may be unable to fill customer orders efficiently  which could harm customer satisfaction 
if we are unable to efficiently process and fill customer orders  customers may cancel or refuse to accept orders  and customer satisfaction could be harmed 
we are subject to  among other things failures in the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our customer contact centers or our sole distribution center in mineral wells  west virginia  including system failures caused by telecommunications systems providers and order volumes that exceed our present telephone or internet system capabilities  
table of contents delays or failures in the performance of third parties  such as shipping companies and the united states postal and customs services  including delays associated with labor disputes  labor union activity  inclement weather  natural disasters  health epidemics and possible acts of terrorism  and disruptions or slowdowns in our order processing or fulfillment systems resulting from increased security measures implemented by us customs  or from homeland security measures  telephone or internet down times  system failures  computer viruses  electrical outages  mechanical problems  human error or accidents  fire  natural disasters or comparable events 
we have a liberal merchandise return policy  and we may experience a greater number of returns than we anticipate 
as part of our customer service commitment  we maintain a liberal merchandise return policy that allows customers to return any merchandise  virtually at any time and for any reason  regardless of condition 
we make allowances in financial statements for anticipated merchandise returns based on historical return rates and future expectations 
these allowances may be exceeded  however  by actual merchandise returns as a result of many factors  including changes in the merchandise mix  size and fit  actual or perceived quality  differences between the actual product and its presentation in catalogs or on the website  timeliness of delivery  competitive offerings and consumer preferences or confidence 
any significant increase in merchandise returns or merchandise returns that exceed our expectations would result in adjustments to the sales return accrual and to cost of sales and could have a material and adverse affect on financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
quarterly results of operations fluctuate and may be negatively impacted by a failure to predict sales trends and by seasonal influences 
net sales  operating results  liquidity and cash flows have fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  on a quarterly basis  as well as on an annual basis  as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following the number and timing of premium retail store openings  the timing and number of e mails delivered  the timing of catalog mailings and the number of catalogs we mail  the ability to accurately estimate and accrue for merchandise returns and the costs of obsolete inventory disposition  the timing of merchandise receiving and shipping  including any delays resulting from labor strikes or slowdowns  adverse weather conditions  health epidemics or national security measures  and shifts in the timing of important holiday selling seasons relative to our fiscal quarters  including valentine s day  easter  mother s day  thanksgiving and christmas  and the day of the week on which certain important holidays fall 
our results continue to depend materially on sales and profits from the november and december holiday shopping season 
in anticipation of traditionally increased holiday sales activity  we incur certain significant incremental expenses  including the hiring of a substantial number of temporary employees to supplement the existing workforce 
if  for any reason  we were to realize lower than expected sales or profits during the november and december holiday selling season  our financial condition  results of operations  including related gross margins  and cash flows for the entire fiscal year would be materially adversely affected 
we face substantial competition from discount retailers in the women s apparel industry 
we face substantial competition from discount retailers  such as kohl s and target  for basic elements in our merchandise lines  and net sales may decline or grow more slowly if we are unable to differentiate our 
table of contents merchandise and shopping experience from these discount retailers 
in addition  the retail apparel industry has experienced significant price deflation over the past several years largely due to the downward pressure on retail prices caused by discount retailers 
we expect this price deflation to continue as a result of the expiration of quota restrictions on the importing of apparel into the united states from foreign countries that are members of the world trade organization 
this price deflation may make it more difficult for us to maintain gross margins and to compete with retailers that have greater purchasing power than we have 
furthermore  because we continue to source a significant percentage of our merchandise through intermediaries and from suppliers and manufacturers located in the united states and canada  where labor and production costs  on average  tend to be higher  gross margins may be lower than those of competing retailers 
our success is dependent upon our senior management team 
future success depends largely on the efforts of dennis pence  chairman and chief executive officer  georgia shonk simmons  president and chief merchandising officer  melvin dick  executive vice president and chief financial officer  and daniel griesemer  president and chief operating officer 
the loss of any of these individuals or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the business 
furthermore  the location of our corporate headquarters in sandpoint  idaho  may make it more difficult to replace key employees who leave us  or to add qualified employees we will need to manage our further growth 
prior to joining our company  melvin dick  our executive vice president and chief financial officer  served as the lead engagement partner for arthur andersen llp s audit of worldcom s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december   and its subsequent review of worldcom s condensed consolidated financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended march  the ongoing investigation of the worldcom matter may require mr 
dick s attention  which may impair his ability to devote his full time and attention to our company 
further  mr 
dick s association with the worldcom matter may adversely affect customers or investors perception of our company 
our multi channel model may expose us to the risk that we may be assessed for unpaid taxes 
our multi channel business model subjects us to state and local taxes in numerous jurisdictions  including state income  franchise  and sales and use tax 
we collect these taxes in any jurisdiction in which we have a physical presence 
while we believe we have paid or accrued for all taxes based on our interpretation of applicable law  tax laws are complex and interpretations differ from state to state 
in the past  some taxing jurisdictions have assessed additional taxes and penalties on us  asserting either an error in our calculation or an interpretation of the law that differed from our own 
it is possible that taxing authorities may make additional assessments in the future 
in addition to taxes  penalties and interest  these assessments could cause us to incur legal fees associated with resolving disputes with taxing authorities 
additionally  changes in state and local tax laws  such as temporary changes associated with tax holidays and other programs  require us to make continual changes to our collection and reporting systems that may relate to only one taxing jurisdiction 
if we fail to update our collection and reporting systems in response to these changes  any over collection or under collection of sales taxes could subject us to interest and penalties  as well as private lawsuits and damage to our reputation 
any determination that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could have a negative impact on our investor perceptions 
we dedicate management and financial resources to document  test  monitor and enhance internal control over financial reporting in order to meet the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of we previously determined that a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed as of january  with regard to the evaluation of the appropriate accounting treatment for marketing fees received under the co branded customer credit card program 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we completed the remediation of this material weakness 

table of contents our system of internal controls over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of an effective control system are met 
however  any system of internal controls is subject to inherent limitations and the design of our controls may not provide absolute assurance that all of our objectives will be met 
this includes the possibility that controls may be inappropriately circumvented or overridden  that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that misstatements due to errors or fraud may not be prevented or detected 
any failure in the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting could have a material effect on financial reporting or cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations  and could negatively impact investor perceptions 
the stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely 
the market price for our common stock has fluctuated and has been and will continue to be significantly affected by  among other factors  quarterly operating results  changes in any earnings estimates publicly announced by us or by analysts  customer response to merchandise offerings  the size of catalog mailings  the timing of retail store openings or of important holiday seasons relative to our fiscal periods  seasonal effects on sales and various factors affecting the economy in general 
the reported high and low closing sale prices of our common stock were per share and per share  respectively  during the fiscal year ended february  in addition  stock markets generally have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility and market prices for the stock of many companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to their operating performance 
the largest stockholders may exert influence over our business regardless of the opposition of other stockholders or the desire of other stockholders to pursue an alternate course of action 
dennis pence  our chairman and chief executive officer may be deemed to beneficially own directly and indirectly approximately percent of outstanding common stock as of december  ann pence  our former vice chairman  may be deemed to beneficially own  directly and indirectly  approximately percent of outstanding common stock as of december  either dennis pence or ann pence acting independently  could have significant influence over any matters submitted to stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of business combinations  and could delay  deter or prevent a change of control of the company  which may adversely affect the market price of common stock 
the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders 
provisions in the charter documents and delaware law may inhibit a takeover and discourage  delay or prevent stockholders from replacing or removing current directors or management 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger with or acquisition of us  even where the stockholders may consider it to be favorable 
these provisions could also prevent or hinder an attempt by stockholders to replace current directors and include providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  authorizing the board to designate and issue blank check preferred stock  limiting persons who can call special meetings of the board of directors or stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at a stockholders meeting 
because the board of directors appoints management  any inability to effect a change in the board of directors may also result in the entrenchment of management 

table of contents we are also subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which  subject to exceptions  prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder 
the preceding provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as section of the delaware general corporation law  could discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change of control and prevent changes in our management

our current fiscal year ended february  fiscal consists of weeks while the fiscal years ended january  fiscal and january  fiscal consisted of weeks 
the rd week did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position for the year ending february  coldwater creek profile coldwater creek is a specialty retailer of women s apparel  accessories  jewelry and gift items 
founded in as a catalog company  today we are a multi channel specialty retailer generating billion in net sales in fiscal our proprietary merchandise assortment reflects a sophisticated yet relaxed and casual lifestyle 
a commitment to providing superior customer service is manifest in all aspects of our business 
we serve our customers through an expanding base of retail stores  as well as our catalog and e commerce channels 
our merchandise assortment  retail stores  catalogs and e commerce website are designed to appeal to women who are years of age and older with average annual household incomes in excess of  
table of contents our mission is to become one of the premier specialty retailers for women years of age and older in the united states by offering our customers a compelling merchandise assortment with superior customer service through all three sales channels 
recent developments and strategic initiatives retail expansion we expect the retail business to be the key driver of our growth strategy 
we believe there is an opportunity for us to grow our premium store base to to stores in more than identified markets nationwide over the next three to five years 
in fiscal  we successfully opened premium retail stores  increasing our total premium store count to  covering markets 
we also operated one resort store and merchandise clearance outlets at the end of fiscal we currently plan to open premium retail stores in fiscal a key component in the success of our retail expansion strategy is adequate warehouse and distribution capacity 
to ensure adequate capacity is continuously available  we made the decision in fiscal to expand our mineral wells  west virginia distribution center 
during fiscal  construction of the  square foot expansion was completed  increasing the center s size from  square feet to  square feet 
we believe the newly expanded facility will provide the capacity required to support our retail expansion goals 
throughout fiscal  we also continued to make improvements in our distribution infrastructure  processes and technology 
these improvements were made to expedite the flow of merchandise through our distribution center with the goal of moving product more quickly to our premium retail stores 
we plan to continue making such improvements in the future 
national branding campaign one of the primary vehicles for attracting new customers to the coldwater creek brand has been the placement of multiple page advertisements in national magazines 
these advertisements are designed to drive traffic and sales to all of our channels  while promoting a heightened awareness of the coldwater creek brand 
advertisements are placed in high circulation magazine publications popular with our customer such as good housekeeping  better homes gardens  country living  southern living  martha stewart and woman s day 
we significantly increased this national advertising campaign during fiscal  spending approximately million in fiscal versus million in fiscal during the second half of fiscal  we also tested a television advertising campaign in limited markets 
in fiscal  we plan to continue to invest in national branding through national magazine advertising and continued testing of television advertising  spending approximately million 
we anticipate that through improved brand recognition these advertisements will continue to translate into increased market share and improved profitability 
coldwater creek catalog in the first quarter of fiscal  we introduced the coldwater creek catalog 
this catalog differs from our other catalog titles in that it exclusively features merchandise available in our premium retail stores and is designed to encourage customers to shop at our stores 
as such  it is mailed into markets where a premium retail store is located 
the catalog supplements our other catalog titles  communicating with customers in between catalog mailings and notifying them of current promotions in the premium retail store 
while the catalog is designed to increase retail segment sales  we believe it also contributes  albeit to a lesser extent  to direct segment sales 
during fiscal  we mailed approximately million coldwater creek catalogs compared to the million mailed during fiscal a contributing factor to this increase was our retail expansion which provided us with the opportunity to mail the coldwater creek catalog into additional markets 
in fiscal  we plan to increase the circulation of our coldwater creek catalog to approximately million 

table of contents e mail campaign during fiscal  we continued the expanded e mail campaign program which was launched during fiscal  resulting in the delivery of approximately percent more e mails to customers in fiscal than in fiscal along with more targeted campaigns sent to specific customer segments 
we believe this increase was a contributing factor in the percent increase in internet net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal we plan to continue this campaign in fiscal  monitoring customer response and adjusting the campaign accordingly 
as of february   the database of e mail addresses to which we regularly send customized e mails totaled approximately million compared to million as of january  direct sourcing our merchandise has historically been purchased primarily through domestic importers who procured the merchandise on our behalf 
over the past two years  however  we have begun to work directly with foreign manufacturers  launching our direct sourcing initiative in the third quarter of fiscal the benefits of direct sourcing include improved control over the production  quality and transportation logistics of our merchandise 
we believe these benefits result in faster speed to market  improved quality and higher profit margins 
approximately percent of our merchandise was purchased directly from manufacturers in fiscal during fiscal  this percentage increased to approximately percent 
we currently plan to direct source percent of our merchandise purchases by the end of fiscal and approximately percent by the end of fiscal to support this initiative we opened a sourcing office in hong kong in the fourth quarter of fiscal and an office in india in the first quarter of fiscal  with additional staff located in guatemala 
these sourcing offices work closely with direct sourcing personnel located at our corporate headquarters 
the primary functions of these offices include product development and production management 
coldwater creek the spa in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced plans to expand on our legacy of providing exceptional customer service as we test a new concept  coldwater creek the spa 
during the first quarter of fiscal we opened one of six planned day spa locations with the remaining five locations opened in the second quarter 
these day spas offer a complete menu of spa treatments  including massages  facials  body treatments  manicures and pedicures 
in addition to spa treatments  the day spas carry an assortment of relevant apparel as well as lines of personal care products for women 
each day spa is located in close proximity to an existing premium retail store as we believe this creates significant opportunities for us to cross market coldwater creek retail stores and coldwater creek the spa and thereby increase traffic and sales in both concepts 
we currently plan to open three additional day spa locations during fiscal  one of which is planned for opening in the second quarter with the remaining two scheduled to open in the third quarter 
each of the new day spa locations will be adjacent to one of our premium retail stores and will be connected to the store via an internal pass through  which we hope to utilize to increase traffic to both concepts 
during fiscal  operating losses related to the day spa concept reduced our consolidated income from operations as a percentage of net sales by approximately percentage point 
the day spa concept differs in many aspects from our core business and will continue to require special attention to fully assess its long term potential 
therefore  while we believe the period of time during which our day spa locations have been open is still too short to properly assess the financial viability of the concept  we currently anticipate incurring additional costs related to our test of the day spas  primarily for marketing and promotion 
it initiatives as part of our ongoing efforts to monitor operating efficiency and the ability of our infrastructure to accommodate current and planned growth  we are currently taking steps to improve various information technology tools and systems we utilize 
during fiscal  we commenced activities to review  enhance and replace several fundamental systems  such as our inventory planning and allocation  and financial and human resources systems 

table of contents results of operations fiscal summary consolidated net sales increased million  or percent  due to the addition of premium retail stores since the end of the prior year  quarter over quarter increase in comparable stores sales growth  customer response to our merchandise  the expanded national magazine advertising campaign  an increase in the frequency of e mails sent to a growing database of customers  and revenue related to the co branded credit card program 
increased revenue was partially offset by increased promotional activity  including discounts offered in conjunction with national magazine advertisements and the co branded credit card program 
gross profit dollars increased million  or percent  while the gross profit rate decreased to percent of net sales as a result of increased promotional activity  including fourth quarter clearance activity  and discounts offered in conjunction with national magazine advertising and the co branded credit card program 
the decrease in gross profit rate was partially offset by increased initial merchandise margins and revenue related to our co branded credit card program 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million  or percent  and sg a rate remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales at percent due to personnel and overhead costs associated with the retail expansion and costs associated with the introduction of the day spa concept  increased national magazine advertisements  and increased catalog circulation

table of contents classification revisions and reclassifications we revised our consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal years ended january  and january  to change the classification of the costs related to free product gift with purchase that we periodically provide to customers at the time of sale 
previously  we included the costs related to the gift with purchase as a marketing cost within selling  general  and administrative expense 
we have determined that such cost should have been included in cost of sales 
as a result  we increased cost of sales by approximately million and million and decreased selling  general and administrative expense by an equal amount for the years ended january  and january   respectively 
during fiscal  we also refined our definition of pre opening costs  which is a component of selling  general and administrative expense  to include rent expense that we incur during the build out phase of a retail store prior to its opening 
as a result  we reclassified approximately million and million in rent expense from cost of sales to selling  general and administrative expense for the years ended january  and january   respectively 
also  during fiscal we revised our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended january  to change the classification of a million increase in restricted cash 
previously  we classified the increase as a cash outflow from financing activities  but have subsequently determined that the increase in restricted cash would be more appropriately classified as an investing activity 
as a result  we increased cash inflows from financing activities by million and increased cash outflows from investing activities by an equal amount for the year ended january  these prior year changes in classification  which we determined to be immaterial  had no impact on our consolidated financial position  income from operations  net income  or our net increase in cash and cash equivalents included in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated net sales consolidated net sales consist of retail and direct sales  which include co branded credit card program marketing fee and sales royalty revenue and shipping fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise 
consolidated net sales increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of the addition of premium retail stores since the end of fiscal in addition  we experienced growth in our comparable premium retail stores during fiscal as compared to fiscal we began reporting comparable premium store sales in the fiscal second quarter as we believe we reached a comparable premium store retail base size at this time that provides for a meaningful comparison 
we plan to continue to provide this information on a quarterly basis 
comparable premium retail store sales growth by quarter is as follows fiscal fiscal fourth quarter third quarter second quarter we define the comparable premium stores as those stores in which the gross square footage has not changed by more than percent in the previous sixteen months and which have been open for at least sixteen consecutive months provided that store has been considered comparable for the entire quarter without closure for seven 
table of contents consecutive days or moving to a different temporary or permanent location 
due to the extensive promotions that occur as part of the opening of a premium store  we believe waiting sixteen months rather than twelve months to consider a store comparable provides a better view of the growth pattern of the premium retail store base 
during the three months ended february   the comparable premium store retail base included premium retail stores compared to premium retail stores for the three months ended january  the calculation of comparable store sales varies across the retail industry and as a result  the calculations of other retail companies may not be consistent with our calculation 
in addition to the opening of new premium retail stores and comparable stores sales growth  consolidated net sales for fiscal benefited from a percent increase in national magazine advertising circulation as compared with fiscal catalog circulation also increased by percent during the same period due primarily to additional coldwater creek catalog mailings  which are designed to drive premium retail store sales 
increased e mail frequency along with the addition of approximately  net new names to our e mail database since the end of fiscal resulted in a percent increase in e mail circulation which also contributed to our net sales growth 
marketing fee revenue related to the co branded credit card program contributed an additional million to the overall increase  while sales royalty revenue related to reward coupons earned under the co branded credit card program contributed million 
although our agreement with the issuing bank extends until the first quarter of fiscal  subject to an annual automatic renewal  there is no assurance that our arrangement with the issuing bank will continue under its current terms 
shipping fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal these increases in net sales were partially offset by markdowns and discounts offered to customers as we increased our promotional activity  including clearance activity in the fiscal fourth quarter  as well as by discounts associated with the co branded credit card program 
consolidated cost of sales gross profit the consolidated gross profit rate decreased percentage points primarily due to increased promotional activity and discounts as well as costs related to our day spa concept that was introduced in fiscal the decrease in gross profit rate was partially offset by higher initial merchandise markups associated with the direct sourcing initiative  improved leveraging of retail occupancy costs and buying and distribution costs 
the costs associated with our day spa concept decreased the consolidated gross profit rate in fiscal by approximately percentage points 
discounts  including those related to national magazine advertisements increased due to higher promotional activity  including clearance activity in the fiscal fourth quarter compared to the prior year  partially offset by higher initial merchandise markups  resulted in a decline of approximately percentage points 
improved leveraging of our retail occupancy costs and buying and distribution costs  partially offset by an increase in shipping and handling costs  increased our gross profit rate by approximately percentage points 
consolidated gross profit rate for fiscal benefited from the recognition of co branded credit card program fee and royalty revenue of million compared to million in fiscal consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses fiscal consolidated sg a expenses increased as compared to fiscal  primarily as the result of increased employee expenses 
this increase was driven mainly by increased salaries and wages for retail administrative and store employee staff and related taxes and benefits as we continue to build personnel to support the expanding retail store base 
national magazine advertisements also contributed to the sg a expense increase as circulation grew by percent as compared to the prior year 

table of contents as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses improved percentage points in fiscal as compared to fiscal this improvement in sg a expenses was the result of a percentage point decrease in catalog expense  partially offset by a percentage point increase in marketing and advertising expenses and a percentage point increase in employee expenses 
marketing and advertising expense increases were driven primarily by national magazine advertising and retail store promotions 
employee expenses increased as the result of retail administrative and store employee wages  salaries and related taxes and benefits in addition to increases in stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas r 
catalog expense decreased  as a percentage of net sales  as the retail segment continues to represent a larger portion of consolidated net sales 
consolidated interest  net and other the increase in consolidated interest  net and other for fiscal as compared to fiscal is the result of higher interest income earned on the investment of a higher average cash balance  as well as higher average interest rates 
consolidated provision for income taxes the increase in the consolidated provision for income taxes for fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of higher pre tax income 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate for the same periods is primarily the result of a release of interest accrued on positions taken in prior year returns in which the statute of limitations expired and a shift to qualified performance based executive compensation programs which are now fully deductible for tax purposes 
these decreases to our effective rate were partially offset by stock option expense recorded for incentive stock options  related to our adoption of sfas r  which is not deductible for tax purposes

we believe increased promotional activity  increased circulation in both national magazine advertisements and the coldwater creek catalog  which is designed to drive premium retail store traffic  contributed to the growth in retail segment net sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal outlet and resort stores contributed million to the retail segment net sales growth in fiscal as compared to fiscal while net sales from our day spa concept contributed million 
segment operating income retail segment operating income rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal decreased by percentage points 
this decrease was driven primarily by a percentage point increase related to costs primarily overhead  product and service costs and other employee expenses associated with the day spa concept 
in addition  increased promotional activity  including fourth quarter clearance activity  partially offset by improvements in merchandise margins related to higher initial merchandise markups associated with our direct sourcing initiative and higher purchase volumes related to the retail expansion contributed percentage points to the decline in retail segment operating income rate 
the rate was also reduced by an increase in employee  marketing  and certain distribution costs of percentage points  percentage points and percentage points  respectively 
offsetting these decreases was a percentage point improvement in retail store occupancy costs predominantly related to the leveraging these costs over increased comparable premium retail store sales 
direct segment sales the direct segment net sales increase of million during fiscal as compared to fiscal was driven by a percent increase in internet business net sales 
internet business net sales grew during the period as a result of an expanding database of e mail addresses and an increase in the frequency of e mails sent to customers 
increased promotional activity during the latter half of fiscal also contributed to the growth 
sales through our catalog segment remained relatively flat year over year  experiencing a decline of percent 
catalog net sales are derived from orders taken from customers over the phone or through the mail 
catalogs are used as a brand marketing vehicle to drive sales in all channels and we encourage customers to choose the channel they deem most convenient 
sales made through other channels that we believe were driven by the initial receipt of a catalog are not included in catalog net sales 
consequently  as customers choose to purchase merchandise through other channels  we expect catalog business net sales to continue to generally decrease as a percent of total net sales 
included in the direct segment net sales increase was an additional million in shipping revenue associated with increased direct segment net sales in fiscal as compared to the fiscal and an additional million in co branded credit card program fee and royalty revenue 

table of contents segment operating income direct segment operating income rate for fiscal increased percentage points as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to a percentage point improvement in the leveraging of direct segment marketing costs as these costs were spread over increased direct segment sales 
improved leveraging of overhead costs  predominantly depreciation  and employee expenses contributed percentage points to the increase 
merchandise margin improvements resulting from higher initial merchandise markups associated with our direct sourcing initiative and higher purchase volumes related to the retail expansion  partially offset by increased promotional activity in the latter half of fiscal  contributed an improvement of percentage points to the increase in retail segment operating income rate 
unallocated corporate and other unallocated corporate and other expenses increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal mainly due to an additional million in marketing expenses primarily related to our national branding campaign 
corporate support costs  primarily depreciation and professional service fees  contributed to an additional million increase  while employee expenses  consisting predominantly of corporate salaries and benefits  increased by million

increased e mail frequency along with a net increase in the size of our e mail database since the end of fiscal resulted in an increase in internet channel net sales 
revenue related to the introduction of a co branded credit card program in the fiscal second quarter contributed million to the increase 
these positive impacts were partially offset by decreased catalog channel net sales  which we believe resulted from customers choosing to order via the internet or our premium retail stores 
discounts offered through the co branded credit card program and national magazine advertising also decreased consolidated net sales 

table of contents consolidated cost of sales gross profit the consolidated gross profit rate increased percentage points primarily due to higher initial merchandise markups associated with the direct sourcing initiative and higher purchase volumes related to the retail expansion

the co branded credit card program contributed million in marketing and royalty revenues

consolidated interest  net  and other the increase in consolidated interest  net and other was primarily due to increased interest income on the investment of our available cash

these new stores contributed million in net sales 
additionally  premium retail stores that were open during only a portion of fiscal  but were open during the entirety of fiscal  contributed incremental net sales of million 
we believe expanded national magazine advertising and the introduction of coldwater creek catalog also contributed to the growth in premium retail store net sales 
retail segment net sales also increased as a result of a million  or percent  increase in outlet and resort store net sales 
we primarily attribute this increase to the addition of three outlet stores during fiscal additionally  amortization of deferred co branded credit card revenue under our co branded credit card program contributed million to retail segment net sales during fiscal segment operating income we primarily attribute the increase in retail segment operating income to an increase of million  or percent  in premium retail stores operating income 
of this million increase  we attribute million to the premium retail stores opened during fiscal and million to the amortization of deferred co branded credit card marketing fees 
the remaining increase was attributable to stores that were opened prior to fiscal this improvement was partially offset by a million increase in premium retail store administrative and support expenses 
these expenses increased primarily as a result of retail expansion 
we primarily attribute the increase in retail segment operating income rate to higher merchandise margins and improved leveraging of retail store occupancy expenses 
merchandise margins on net sales from premium retail stores increased primarily as a result of lower merchandise costs related to higher purchase volumes and the direct sourcing initiative 
improvements in the leveraging of premium retail store occupancy expenses were the result of improved retail segment net sales 
these positive impacts were partially offset by reduced leveraging of personnel costs associated with the retail expansion and increased investment in premium retail store advertising 
the increase in personnel costs primarily included administrative and technical support salaries  store employee wages and related taxes and employee benefits as we continue to build personnel infrastructure in anticipation of future growth related to retail expansion 
investment in premium retail store advertising increased as a result of increased retail promotional costs  including banners and other signage 
we made this investment in an effort to increase store traffic and enhance the shopping experience 
direct segment sales the growth in internet business net sales was primarily driven by an expanding database of e mail addresses and an increase in the frequency of e mails sent to customers in that database 
our database of e mail addresses 
table of contents increased percent during fiscal  while the frequency of e mails sent increased approximately percent 
additionally  the co branded credit card program contributed million in fee revenues to the internet business net sales 
our catalog business net sales are derived from orders taken from customers over the phone or through the mail 
catalogs are used as a brand marketing vehicle to drive sales in all channels 
we encourage customers to choose the channel they deem most convenient 
sales made through other channels that we believe were driven by the initial receipt of a catalog are not included in catalog net sales 
we primarily attribute the decrease in the net sales of the catalog business to customers choosing to purchase merchandise through other channels 
partially offsetting this decrease were catalog net sales derived from both our expanded national magazine advertising and the introduction of our coldwater creek catalog 
additionally  the co branded credit card program contributed fee revenues of million to catalog business net sales 
segment operating income the increases in direct segment operating income dollars and rate were primarily due to the increase in direct segment net sales  which included credit card fee revenue of million 
also contributing was an improvement in merchandise margins primarily as a result of lower merchandise costs related to higher purchase volumes and the direct sourcing initiative 
unallocated corporate and other the decrease in corporate and other operating contribution dollars and rate was primarily due to an increase in national magazine advertising 
this advertising increased million 
we believe this advertising is an effective vehicle for increasing coldwater creek brand recognition and driving sales to all channels 
also contributing to these decreases was amortization expense of million associated with the granting of  rsus during fiscal no rsus were granted during fiscal these negative impacts were partially offset by improved leveraging of administrative and technical support employee expenses which we believe is the result of increased consolidated net sales 
seasonality as with many apparel retailers  our net sales  operating results  liquidity and cash flows have fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  as a result of a number of factors  including the following the composition  size and timing of various merchandise offerings  the number and timing of premium retail store openings  the timing of catalog mailings and the number of catalogs mailed  the timing of e mail campaigns  customer response to merchandise offerings  including the impact of economic and weather related influences  the actions of competitors and similar factors  overall merchandise return rates  including the impact of actual or perceived service and quality issues  our ability to accurately estimate and accrue for merchandise returns and the costs of obsolete inventory disposition  market price fluctuations in critical materials and services  including paper  production  postage and telecommunications costs  the timing of merchandise receiving and shipping  including any delays resulting from labor strikes or slowdowns  adverse weather conditions  health epidemics or national security measures  and shifts in the timing of important holiday selling seasons relative to our fiscal quarters  including valentine s day  easter  mother s day  thanksgiving and christmas 

table of contents we alter the composition  magnitude and timing of merchandise offerings based upon an understanding of prevailing consumer demand  preferences and trends 
the timing of merchandise offerings may be further impacted by  among other factors  the performance of various third parties on which we are dependent 
additionally  the net sales we realize from a particular merchandise offering may impact more than one fiscal quarter and year and the amount and pattern of the sales realization may differ from that realized by a similar merchandise offering in a prior fiscal quarter or year 
the majority of net sales from a merchandise offering generally are realized within the first several weeks after its introduction with an expected significant decline in customer demand thereafter 
our business materially depends on sales and profits from the november and december holiday shopping season 
in anticipation of traditionally increased holiday sales activity  we incur certain significant incremental expenses  including the hiring of a substantial number of temporary employees to supplement the existing workforce 
additionally  as gift items and accessories are more prominently represented in the november and december holiday season merchandise offerings  we typically expect  absent offsetting factors  to realize higher consolidated gross margins in the second half of our fiscal year 
if  for any reason  we were to realize significantly lower than expected sales or profits during the november and december holiday selling season  our financial condition  results of operations  including related gross margins and cash flows for the entire fiscal year will be materially adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources in recent fiscal years  we have financed ongoing operations and growth initiatives primarily from cash flow generated by operations  trade credit arrangements and the proceeds from our may public offering of common stock 
however  as we produce catalogs  open retail stores and purchase inventory in anticipation of future sales realization  and as operating cash flows and working capital experience seasonal fluctuations  we might occasionally utilize short term bank credit 
on february   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na  providing for an unsecured revolving line of credit of up to million and allowing us to issue up to million in letters of credit 
the interest rate under the credit agreement is based upon either the london interbank offered rate plus a margin ranging from percent to percent depending upon our leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement  or the lender s prime rate 
the credit agreement also contains financial covenants  including requirements for specified minimum net worth and fixed charge ratio as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement restricts our ability to  among other things  dispose of assets except in the ordinary course of business  participate in mergers or acquisitions in excess of million  incur other indebtedness in excess of million and make certain investments 
in addition  we are subject to unused commitment fees based on a varying percentage of the amount of the total facility that is not drawn down under the credit agreement on a quarterly basis 
the credit facility has a maturity date of january  operating activities generated million  million and million of positive cash flow during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
on a comparative year to year basis  the million increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from increased revenues  fees collected from our co branded credit card program of million  an increase in collections of tenant allowances of million and an increase in interest income collected of million 
this increase was offset by higher operating expenses and inventory purchases primarily related to our retail expansion  in addition to an increase in income taxes paid of million 
also offsetting the increase in cash flows from operating activities was approximately million in tax deduction benefits related to stock option exercises that were recorded in cash flows from financing activities in fiscal  that would have been recorded in cash flows from operating activities if we had not adopted sfas r in fiscal the amount of tax deduction benefits recorded as an operating cash inflow in fiscal were approximately million 

table of contents on a comparative year to year basis  the million increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from increased revenues and fees collected from our co branded credit card program 
this increase was offset by higher operating expenses and inventory purchases primarily related to our retail expansion 
cash outflows from investing activities principally consisted of capital expenditures which totaled million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
capital expenditures in fiscal primarily relate to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures associated with the opening of additional premium retail stores  and to a lesser extent our opening of three new outlet stores  the remodeling of certain existing stores  and the expansion of our it and distribution infrastructure 
capital expenditures in fiscal primarily relate to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures associated with the opening of additional premium retail stores and three outlet stores and the expansion of our corporate headquarters 
capital expenditures in fiscal primarily relate to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures associated with the opening of additional premium retail stores and three outlet stores 
cash inflows from financing activities were million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the cash inflows in fiscal and fiscal were derived from activity related to stock option exercises  including tax deduction benefits that beginning in fiscal are recorded as a financing activity as a result of our adoption of sfas r 
our cash inflows in fiscal were derived from proceeds received from stock option exercises and the million net proceeds from our public common stock offering of million shares 
as a result of the foregoing  we had million in consolidated working capital at february   compared with million at january  our consolidated current ratio was at february   compared with at january  we had no outstanding short term or long term bank debt at february  or january  capital expenditures for the full year in fiscal are expected to be approximately million  primarily associated with the company s retail store expansion and store related expenditures and  to a lesser extent  investments in information technology  coldwater creek the spa test and other corporate related capital expenditures 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund our current operations and retail store openings under our current store roll out plan 
however  we may be required to seek additional sources of funds if  for example  we decide to accelerate our retail roll out strategy 
future outlook due to competition from discount retailers that has put downward pressure on retail prices for women s apparel  the apparel industry has experienced significant retail price deflation over the past several years 
we expect this trend to continue 
furthermore  on december   quota restrictions on the importing of apparel into the united states from foreign countries which are members of the world trade organization expired 
the united states and the european union have re imposed trade quotas on certain textile categories that will be in effect through december we currently believe that our sourcing strategy will allow us to adjust to potential shifts in availability of apparel following the expiration of these quotas 
we expect the retail segment to be the key driver of future growth 
as our retail business grows  we will add additional overhead  such as incremental corporate personnel costs and costs associated with improving existing or implementing new information technology infrastructure 
however  over time  we expect sales dollar growth to outpace the addition of infrastructure expenses 
consequently  we believe retail expansion will continue to increase overall profitability 

table of contents we experienced a promotional retail selling environment in the latter part of fiscal  which many of our competitors also experienced 
we believe this promotional activity could carry into fiscal we also anticipate that our recently implemented direct sourcing strategy will contribute to an increase in overall profitability by increasing the percentage of merchandise we purchase directly from overseas manufacturers 
during fiscal we were the importer of record on approximately percent of our total merchandise purchases 
we anticipate we will be the importer of record on approximately percent and percent of our total merchandise purchases by the end of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates about effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the most significant areas involving management judgments are described below 
actual results in these areas could differ from management s estimates 
sales returns we recognize sales and the related cost of sales for our direct segment at the time the merchandise is expected to be delivered to our customer and for our retail segment at the point of sale with a customer in a store 
we reduce our sales and costs of sales and establish and maintain a corresponding accrual for expected sales returns based on historical experience and future expectations 
the ability to reasonably estimate sales returns is made more complex by the fact that we offer our customers a return policy whereby they may return merchandise for any reason and at any time without any restrictions as to condition or time of purchase to any of our locations 
the actual amount of sales returns we subsequently realize may fluctuate from estimates due to several factors  including size and fit  merchandise mix  actual or perceived quality  differences between the actual product and its presentation in the catalog or website  timeliness of delivery and competitive offerings 
we continually track subsequent sales return experience  compile customer feedback to identify any pervasive issues  reassess the marketplace  compare our findings to previous estimates and adjust the sales return accrual and cost of sales accordingly 
historically the difference between estimated sales returns and actual results has not been significant 
provisions for sales returns were as follows in thousands balance at beginning of period amounts charged to net income write offs against reserve balance at end of period fiscal year ended january  january  february  co branded credit card fee revenue we currently maintain a co branded credit card program 
under this program  we receive from the issuing bank an upfront non refundable marketing fee for each new account that is opened and activated as well as a sales royalty based on a percentage of purchases made by the holder of the co branded credit card 
we have determined  given our continuing involvement  that the initial upfront marketing fee should be deferred and recognized into revenue over the estimated life of the related customer relationship 
our estimate of the life of the customer relationship is based on the historical buying patterns of our credit card customers and is subject to 
table of contents change based on actual buying patterns 
any increase in the estimated customer relationship period would result in less revenue being recognized in a reporting period  while any decrease in the customer relationship period would result in more revenue being recognized in a reporting period 
our average customer relationship period in fiscal and fiscal was not materially different 
inventory valuation our inventories consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are reflected  in the aggregate  on the balance sheet at the lower of cost or market 
the nature of our business requires that we make substantially all of our merchandising and marketing decisions and corresponding inventory purchase commitments with vendors several months in advance of the time in which a particular merchandise item is intended to be included in the merchandise offerings 
these decisions and commitments are based upon  among other possible considerations  historical sales with identical or similar merchandise  our understanding of fashion trends and influences  as well as an assessment of likely economic conditions and various competitive factors 
we continually make subjective assessments as to whether the carrying cost of inventory exceeds its market value  and  if so  by what dollar amount 
to determine whether inventory should be written down we consider current and anticipated demand and customer preferences in addition to the current and future estimated selling price 
the carrying value of the inventory is reduced to its net realizable value with a corresponding charge to cost of sales 
as a percentage of gross inventories  our reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory was approximately percent and percent as of february  and january   respectively 
the decrease in inventory reserve as a percentage of gross inventories primarily relates to our retail segment and is the result of actual write off experience being lower than estimates and better inventory management  including the successful disposition of slow moving inventory during fiscal though we currently believe our inventory reserve is adequate based upon current forecasts which consider current and future selling prices  actual results may differ from our estimates if we are required to markdown or discount merchandise beyond our current expectations 
direct response advertising direct response advertising includes catalogs and national magazine advertisements that contain an identifying code that allows us to track the related sales 
all direct costs associated with the development  production and circulation of direct response advertising are accumulated as prepaid marketing costs until such time as the related catalog is mailed or the related national magazine advertisement first appears in print 
after that  these costs are reclassified as deferred marketing costs and are amortized into selling  general and administrative expenses over the expected sales realization cycle  typically several weeks 
the initial estimation of the expected sales realization cycle for a particular direct response advertisement is based upon  among other possible considerations  our historical sales and sell through experience with identical or similar direct response advertisements  our understanding of then prevailing fashion trends and influences  assessment of prevailing economic conditions and various competitive factors 
we continually track our subsequent sales realization  compile customer feedback for indications of future performance  reassess the marketplace  compare the findings to our previous estimate and adjust amortization going forward 
stock based compensation effective january   our accounting policy related to stock option accounting changed upon our adoption of sfas r 
sfas r requires us to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based upon the value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award generally the vesting period of the equity award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the share based award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the share based award and forfeitures 

table of contents in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate is a less subjective assumption as it is based on factual data derived from public sources 
we use a dividend yield of zero as we have never paid cash dividends and have no intention to pay cash dividends in the immediate future 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based upon a combination of both the implied and historical volatilities of our stock which is obtained from public data sources 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that share based awards are expected to be outstanding  giving consideration to vesting schedules and historical exercise patterns 
we determine the expected life assumption based upon the exercise and post vesting behavior that has been exhibited historically  adjusted for specific factors that may influence future exercise patterns 
if expected volatility or expected life were to increase  that would result in an increase in the fair value of our stock options which would result in higher compensation charges  while a decrease in volatility or the expected life would result in a lower fair value of our stock option awards resulting in lower compensation charges 
we also grant rsus and common stock which are less subjective in determining fair value as the fair value of these awards is based upon the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and not on an option pricing model 
we estimate forfeitures for all of our awards based upon historical experience of stock based pre vesting forfeitures 
we believe that our estimates are based upon outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur 
if actual forfeitures are higher than our estimates it would result in lower compensation expense and to the extent the actual forfeitures are lower than our estimate we would record higher compensation expense 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  more specifically leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures at our retail stores and day spas  are subject to a review for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if the future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset or asset group is less than it s carrying amount  it is considered to be impaired and would be written down to its fair value 
currently we have not experienced any events that would indicate a potential impairment of the assets relating to our retail stores and day spas  but if circumstances change we could be required to record a loss for the impairment of long lived assets 
for example  given the infancy of the day spa concept and based upon management s current forecasts we do not believe an impairment of the related assets exists 
if management s current forecasted expectations do not materialize in the future  we could be required to record an impairment loss on assets related to the day spa concept 
recently issued accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents off balance sheet liabilities and other contractual obligations we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a of regulation s k 
the following tables summarize our minimum contractual commitments and commercial obligations as of february  in thousands payments due in fiscal year total thereafter contractual obligations operating leases a inventory purchase orders b capital leases c other long term liabilities d total a 
we lease retail store space as well as other property and equipment under operating leases 
retail store leases require the payment of additional rent based on sales above a specified minimum 
the operating lease obligations noted above do not include any contingent rental expense we may incur based on future sales above the specified minimums 
some lease agreements provide lease renewal options 
future operating lease obligations would change if these renewal options were exercised 
b 
we expect to pay all of our commitments relating to inventory purchases in the next twelve months 
the actual timing of the payments is subject to change based upon actual receipt of the inventory and the terms of payment with the vendor 
c 
the term of the capital lease is approximately years and bears interest at percent 
payments represent the principal amount due of million  accrued interest of  and interest expense to be incurred of approximately million 
based upon the payment terms of the lease agreement  principal payments will not begin until approximately fiscal year  and all payments through such date represent interest only payments 
d 
other long term liabilities primarily include amounts on our february  consolidated balance sheet representing obligations under our supplemental executive retirement plan as well as asset retirement obligations under certain of our lease arrangements 
although we do not expect to pay any cash out in the next twelve months  the timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is uncertain and subject to change based upon circumstances not necessarily within our control 
we have excluded million and million of deferred rents and deferred revenue  respectively  from the other long term liabilities in the above table 
these amounts have been excluded as deferred rents relate to operating leases which are already reflected in the operating lease category above and the deferred revenue does not represent a contractual obligation that will be settled in cash 
our only individually significant operating lease is for our distribution center and customer contact center located in mineral wells  west virginia 
during the third quarter of fiscal  construction was completed on the  square foot expansion to this distribution center  increasing the distribution center size from  square feet to  square feet 
as a result  the distribution center operating lease was amended to include the expansion and extend the lease term from approximately years to years 
our remaining lease commitment as of february  is approximately million and has been reflected in the schedule above 
all other operating leases primarily pertain to retail and outlet stores  our coeur d alene  idaho customer contact center and to various equipment and technology 
subsequent to february   we entered into additional retail leases with minimum lease payment requirements  and as a result  as of march  our operating lease commitments increased net of subsequent lease payments made by million 
as of february  we had million in letters of credit issued 

table of contents related party transactions dennis pence and ann pence personally participate in a jet fractional share program through two entities they own 
ann pence  who was the vice chairman of our board of directors until august  is a holder of more than five percent of our common stock and holds the title of chairman emeritus 
we maintain an arrangement with dennis pence and ann pence pursuant to which  on occasion  we reimburse them for the usage of their fractional share interests to fulfill a portion of our business travel needs 
for flights by mr 
pence and other corporate executives made exclusively for official corporate purposes  we reimbursed these entities for a usage based pro rata portion of the actual financing costs of the jet fractional share rights  a usage based pro rata portion of the actual monthly maintenance fees  and actual hourly usage fees 
during fiscal  there were no expense reimbursements to dennis pence or ann pence as we obtained interests in a business jet fractional share program sufficient to satisfy our executive travel requirements 
aggregate expense reimbursements totaled approximately million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
ann pence retired from her position as a member of our board of directors  effective august  in connection with her retirement  and in recognition of her contributions as co founder of the company  she was given the honorary title of chairman emeritus  and was extended certain post retirement benefits 
during the fiscal third quarter  we accrued the net present value of the expected future benefit costs 
this accrual is being amortized ratably into consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses and offsets the impact of the current post retirement benefits expense 
these amounts were immaterial to all periods presented and will be immaterial to all future periods 
effective june   in connection with his resignation from our board of directors  warren r 
hashagen entered into an agreement to provide strategic and operational consulting services 
the agreement  which expired on june   provided cash compensation of  per month  plus reimbursement of expenses 
the agreement also included customary confidentiality provisions and required mr 
hashagen to notify us prior to engaging in business activities that are competitive with our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not been materially impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as substantially all of our business is transacted in  and is expected to continue to be transacted in  us dollars or us dollar based currencies 
we have only been immaterially impacted by fluctuations in interest rates as a result of our relatively modest bank borrowings in recent fiscal years 
during the twelve month period ended february   we did not have borrowings under our credit facility and  consequently  did not have any material exposure to interest rate market risks during or at the end of this period 
however  as any future borrowings under our amended and restated bank credit facility will be at a variable rate of interest  we could potentially be materially adversely impacted should we require significant borrowings in the future  particularly during a period of rising interest rates 
we have not used  and currently do not anticipate using  any derivative financial instruments
