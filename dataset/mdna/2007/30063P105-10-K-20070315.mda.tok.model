item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section has been derived from our consolidated financial statements and should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
overview exact sciences corporation develops proprietary dna based technologies for use in the detection of cancer 
we have selected colorectal cancer as the first application of our technologies 
we have licensed certain of our technologies  including improvements to such technologies  on an exclusive basis through august to laboratory corporation of america holdings labcorp for use in a commercial testing service developed by labcorp and marketed under the name pregen plus 
pregen plus is a non invasive  stool based dna testing service for the detection of colorectal cancer in the average risk population 
since our inception in february  our principal activities have included researching and developing our technologies for colorectal cancer screening  including pregen plus and our next generation version technology  conducting clinical studies to validate our colorectal cancer screening technologies  negotiating licenses for intellectual property of others  developing relationships with opinion leaders in the scientific and medical communities  conducting market studies and analyzing various markets for our technologies  raising capital  licensing our proprietary technologies to labcorp  working to further the adoption of stool based dna testing for colon cancer  including seeking inclusion of such technology in the guidelines of the major guidelines organizations  working with labcorp on activities in support of the commercialization of pregen plus  and sales and marketing efforts in support of pregen plus 
we have generated limited operating revenues since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have historically resulted from costs incurred in conjunction with our research and development initiatives  salaries and benefits associated with the hiring of personnel  the initiation of marketing programs and the build out of our sales infrastructure to support the commercialization and marketing of pregen plus 
we expect that our losses will continue for the next several years as a result of continuing research  development  sales and marketing expenses 
labcorp launched pregen plus commercially in august from the date of launch through december   labcorp had accessioned approximately  pregen plus samples  including approximately   and  samples  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
to achieve sufficient demand for pregen plus  we believe that stool based dna testing must be included in colorectal cancer screening guidelines of the major guidelines organizations including the guidelines of the american cancer society  the acs  and the us multisociety task force on colorectal cancer  a consortium of several organizations including representatives of the american college of gastroenterology  american gastroenterological association  american society for gastrointestinal endoscopy and american college of physicians society of internal medicine the mstf crc  together the acs mstf crc and that substantial funds will likely need to be invested in sales and marketing efforts over the next several years 
we do not have  and we cannot assure you that labcorp will devote  the funds that we believe are likely necessary to build sufficient demand for pregen plus 
even if stool based dna screening is included in colorectal cancer screening guidelines and sufficient amounts are invested in sales and marketing efforts  our success will also depend upon a number of factors that are largely out of our control  including the following the positioning of stool based dna screening within guidelines such that it is not limited among the screening options offered  the regulatory requirements for  and any regulatory restrictions placed upon  pregen plus or any other product based on our technologies  and the timing of any required regulatory filings and approval processes  whether labcorp continues to offer pregen plus commercially  acceptance  endorsement and formal policy approval of stool based dna screening for reimbursement by medicare and other third party payors  effective labcorp sales and sales management personnel and processes to educate physicians and their staffs regarding pregen plus and patient compliance  our success in educating third party payors  managed care organizations  and technology assessment groups regarding stool based dna screening  effective negotiation and contracting by labcorp with medicare and other third party payors for coverage and reimbursement of pregen plus  patient acceptance of pregen plus  including its novel sample collection process  stool based dna screening becoming a standard of care among prescribing physicians  and the quality and service of the labcorp testing process 
until such time as some or all of the factors outlined above are in place  we do not expect material revenue growth 
our revenue is comprised of product royalty fees on pregen plus tests sold by labcorp  product revenue from the sale to labcorp of effipure components  which are used by labcorp in processing pregen plus tests  and the amortization of license fees for the licensing of product rights to labcorp under our strategic license agreements 
we expect that product royalty fees and license fee revenue for will be substantially consistent with amounts recorded in labcorp informed the fda during that they were working on changes to pregen plus that could eliminate the use of effipure in pregen plus 
we  therefore  do not expect to record material revenues from the sale of effipure components to labcorp during the potential loss of this revenue beginning in is not expected to have a material impact on our gross margins because  under our agreement with labcorp  our effipure sales to labcorp resulted in no gross margin as labcorp reimbursed us only for our costs to provide effipure to them 
we account for pregen plus royalty fees on a cash basis and until such time as we have sufficient historical reimbursement data necessary to estimate and record our product royalty fees on an accrual basis  we will continue to recognize revenue from product royalty fees on a cash basis 
while labcorp has received payment on approximately of the pregen plus tests accessioned by labcorp to date  laboratory operating factors such as turnaround times for the testing process  possible pre and post analytical sample and sample processing deficiencies and third party reimbursement all influence the timing and whether an accession by labcorp will eventually be recognized as revenue by us 
on october   we initiated a plan to reduce our cost structure by eliminating positions  or of our staff  across all departments to reduce expenses 
since this workforce reduction  our efforts have focused on the pursuit of inclusion of stool based dna testing in screening guidelines of the major guidelines organizations  including the guidelines of the acs mstf crc  medicare coverage pursuit for stool based dna testing  and optimization and validation of our version technology 
pursuant to the restructuring plan  we accrued charges of million in the quarter ended december  in connection with one time employee termination benefits  including severance  outplacement and fringe benefits 
we continue to assess our facility needs and could incur additional restructuring charges  in the form of write offs of leasehold improvements or other fixed assets  in the event facilities are consolidated 
until its facility plans are finalized  we can not currently estimate the amount of those charges  if any 
research and development expenses include costs related to scientific and laboratory personnel  research and clinical studies and reagents and supplies used in the development of our technologies and  effective as of january   non cash stock based compensation related to the amortization of the fair value of stock option awards granted to employees 
as a result of restructuring our operations  we expect that our research and development costs in will be lower than levels 
our research and development efforts in will focus on the validation and optimization of the next generation of our colorectal cancer screening technology  or version of our technology 
while we have taken steps to lower research and development costs by focusing on version of our technology  we may need to invest substantial funds in additional research  design and development to successfully commercialize our version technology or other potential future products 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of non research personnel salaries  office expenses  professional fees and  as of january   non cash stock based compensation related to the amortization of the fair value of stock option awards granted to employees 
we expect sales and marketing expenses in to be lower than levels primarily as a result of lower headcount and external promotional spending 
we expect general and administrative expenses in to be consistent with levels 
in connection with our october restructuring  we entered into employment retention agreements with our remaining employees  which provide for severance and a one time retention bonus in the aggregate amount of approximately million payable on december  subject to acceleration in certain circumstances  provided that they continue to be employed on the date of payment 
the retention agreements also provide that upon the occurrence of certain triggering events  such as a change of control or termination without cause  remaining employees will be entitled to receive any unpaid retention bonus and severance payments for periods ranging from three to twelve months at a rate equal to their base salary at the time of termination of employment 
in addition  in june  we entered into an employment agreement with don m 
hardison  our president and chief executive officer  under which he is eligible to earn an annual retention bonus in the amount of million payable on each of january  and january   provided that he continues to be employed by on the date of payment 
as of december   we had accrued approximately million in compensation costs in connection with the retention bonuses for the remaining employees and mr 
hardison 
we intend to accrue the remaining cost of the retention bonuses  currently estimated to be approximately million  on a straight line basis over the remaining retention period  which ends on december  see note of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for a description of the employment agreement between the company and don m 
hardison 
significant accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we believe that that the following accounting policies and judgments are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition 
license fees for the licensing of product rights on initiation of strategic agreements are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the license period 
product royalty fees on pregen plus tests performed by labcorp are recorded as revenue when cash payments are received from labcorp pursuant to our license agreement with labcorp 
product royalty fees ultimately due to us are based upon the customer s remittance to labcorp  not the amount billed 
until such time as we have sufficient historical reimbursement data necessary to estimate and record our product royalty fees on an accrual basis  we will continue to recognize revenue from product royalty fees on a cash basis 
product revenue from the sale of certain components of our effipure technology to labcorp is recognized upon transfer of the components provided that title passes  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is probable 
we bear the risk of obsolescence related to the effipure inventory 
revenue from milestone and other performance based payments  if any  is recognized as revenue when the milestone or performance is achieved and collection of the receivable is estimable and probable 
patent costs 
patent costs are capitalized as incurred and are amortized beginning when patents are issued over an estimated useful life of five years 
capitalized patent costs are expensed upon disallowance of the patent  upon a decision by us to no longer pursue the patent  or when the related intellectual property is deemed to be no longer of value to us 
we apply sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for long lived assets sfas no 
 which requires us to continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
such events may include whether stool based dna screening is included in colorectal cancer screening guidelines or a change in the regulatory requirements for pregen plus 
we did not record any impairment charges during the year ended december  we believe that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that we may be subject to  and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of operations  financial position and cash flows for the periods presented 
stock based compensation 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation plans under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r effective january  using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and shares purchased under an employee stock purchase plan if certain parameters are not met  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values

 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no  as originally issued and emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
under the modified prospective transition method  we recognized stock based compensation expense during the year ended december  in connection with a stock options and restricted stock awards granted and employee stock purchase plan awards with offering periods commencing prior to  but not yet vested  as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no

r and c stock options including awards which were fully vested as of january  which were modified during the year ended december  under the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods are not restated 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  we recorded incremental stock based compensation expense of million in connection with the foregoing in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  total stock based compensation recorded during the year ended december  of million included million recorded in connection with common stock to be issued to a collaborator  stock options and restricted stock awards granted to non employee consultants and directors as well as stock based compensation expense related to the company s k match which  if approved by our board of directors  is made annually in company common stock 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r on january   in accordance with apb no 
 we recognized expenses related to non employee consultant stock option grants and restricted stock awards and our k match in our consolidated statements of operations

common stock to be issued to a collaborator  non employee consultant stock option grants  restricted stock awards and our k match are accounted for similarly under both apb no 
and sfas no 
r and are therefore excluded from the table below 
year ended in thousands december  research and development sales and marketing general and administrative as a result of adopting sfas no 
r on january   our loss from operations  as well as our net loss  for the year ended december  was million higher than if we had continued to account for stock based compensation under apb no 
basic and diluted loss per share for the year ended december  was higher than if we had continued to account for stock based compensation under apb no 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of years 
determining fair value valuation and amortization method the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions in the following table 
the estimated fair value of employee stock options is amortized to expense using the straight line method over the vesting period 
expected term we use the simplified calculation of expected life  described in the sec s staff accounting bulletin  as we do not currently have sufficient historical exercise data on which to base an estimate of expected term 
this method allows us to estimate the expected life using the average of the vesting period and the contractual life of the stock options granted 
expected volatility expected volatility is based on our historical volatility from the time of our initial public offering in january of through the measurement date of the awards 
expected volatility was lower in the year ended december  when compared to the same period of as we refined our expectation because  as of january  we had at least five years of historical volatility data on which to base our expectation 
prior to january   sufficient historical volatility data did not exist to reasonably justify a lower expected volatility  and we based volatility in those periods on peer analysis 
risk free interest rate we base the risk free interest rate used in the black scholes valuation method on the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term 
forfeitures as required by sfas no 
r  we record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we do not need to estimate forfeitures because all share based awards vest monthly 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions in the following table

for periods prior to january  the following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per common share as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
to stock based employee compensation for all periods presented 
note that the pro forma disclosures below are provided for the years ended december  and only because employee stock options were not accounted for using the fair value method during those periods

basic and diluted net loss per share as reported pro forma net loss sfas critical accounting estimate third party royalty contingency 
under the terms of our amended license agreement with labcorp  we are contingently liable to reimburse labcorp for a portion of certain fixed third party royalty payments the royalty amount made by labcorp to other parties in connection with its sales of pregen plus 
our liability to pay the royalty amount is based on sales volumes of pregen plus over the exclusive period of the license agreement that terminates on august   and is contingent upon labcorp requesting such payment 
labcorp has not requested any such payment to date 
based on the sales volumes of pre gen plus through december   the potential royalty amount was million 
a significant increase in pregen plus test sales volumes through august   could reduce this obligation  potentially to zero  while test volumes consistent with historical pregen plus sales levels could increase the potential royalty amount by an additional million  bringing the total potential royalty amount to million 
in addition  if stool based dna screening for colorectal cancer is not included in colorectal cancer screening guidelines of the major guidelines organizations  labcorp may request payment of the royalty amount 
we are currently in discussions with labcorp regarding the terms of the license agreement 
based upon these discussions  we believe that  at this time  it is not probable that labcorp will request payment of the royalty amount and  accordingly  we have not accrued any portion of the royalty amount in our financial statements 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully negotiate an amendment to our license agreement that would eliminate our contingent liability to pay the amounts described above 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the interpretation 
the interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have completed our evaluation of the interpretation  and do not currently believe that adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in september  fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  all of our revenues are derived from our license agreement with labcorp 
revenue is primarily composed of the amortization of up front technology license fees associated with agreements signed with labcorp that are being amortized on a straight line basis over the exclusive license period  which ends in august  and  to a lesser extent  royalties on labcorp s sales of pregen plus and sales of effipure units to labcorp 
the increase in total revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of a one time  non cash reduction in revenue of million recorded in june in connection with the amendment of a warrant issued to labcorp in june to purchase  shares of our common stock  at an exercise price of per share 
at the time of issuance  the labcorp warrant had an expiration date of june  on june   we entered into an amendment to the warrant to extend the expiration date to august   which is the expiration date of the exclusive period under our license agreement with labcorp 
all other terms of the warrant were unaffected 
we assigned a value to the warrant extension of million using the black scholes option pricing model 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer  we recorded the cost of the warrant extension as a one time  non cash reduction in license fee revenue of million in the quarter ended june  during  labcorp informed the fda that they were working on changes to pregen plus that could eliminate the use of effipure 
we  therefore  do not expect to record material revenues from the sale of effipure components to labcorp during or beyond 
the loss of this revenue beginning in is not expected to have a material impact on our gross margins because  under our agreement with labcorp  our effipure sales to labcorp resulted in no gross margin as labcorp reimbursed us only for our costs to provide effipure to them 
cost of revenue 
total cost of revenue includes both the cost of effipure components sold to labcorp as well as the cost of product royalty revenue owed to third parties for technology currently incorporated into pregen plus 
total cost of revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in the cost of product revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of the prior year was primarily the result of higher write offs of effipure inventory 
we wrote off million and million in excess effipure inventory during the years ended december  and  respectively 
specifically  we wrote off approximately million in excess effipure inventory units during the quarter ended march  as a result of labcorp s decision to discontinue use of effipure in the processing of pregen plus tests beyond during the development of the manufacturing and supply chain processes for effipure components  we entered into agreements with certain suppliers and contract manufactures to produce components utilized in effipure 
certain of these supply agreements included minimum purchase commitments to be fulfilled by us over the life of the agreements  the last of which expired in april as of december   the carrying value of our effipure inventory was and we do not anticipate purchasing additional effipure inventory 
there can be no assurance that labcorp will be able to identify an alternative process for effipure in connection with labcorp s processing of the pregen plus test  which could result in interruption in the pregen plus testing service and could materially harm our business 
there can also be no assurance that labcorp will cease using effipure in the processing of pregen plus tests in if labcorp does not have a suitable alternative to effipure in place 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in the year ended december  as compared to the same period of was primarily the result of the completion of the primary clinical study supporting version of our stool based dna technology in late  resulting in lower research and development expenses in the year ended december  as compared to the same period of in addition  as described under the heading restructuring below  we took actions in october to reduce our headcount across all departments in order to lower our overall cost structure 
this restructuring contributed to the reduction in research and development costs when comparing the year ended december  to december  included in the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   were decreases of million in personnel related expenses  million in clinical study expenses  million related to laboratory space and million in laboratory supplies 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of as a result of the adoption of sfas no r on january  see discussion of the adoption of sfas no 
r under the section stock based compensation above 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million in personnel related expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of as a result of a reduction in the size of our sales and marketing force from seventeen employees at december  to five employees at december  we also reduced our external advertising  marketing and promotional spending by million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  these reductions reflect a focus on spending primarily on those initiatives that directly or indirectly support guidelines inclusion  as well as a shift away from direct marketing to physicians to third party payor groups  self insured employers and technology assessment groups 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of as a result of the adoption of sfas no r on january  see discussion of the adoption of sfas no 
r under the section stock based compensation above 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of an increase of million in stock based compensation expense recorded in the year ended december  as compared to the same period of as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r on january  see discussion of the adoption of sfas no 
r under the section stock based compensation above 
also included in the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  were increases in professional fees of million and personnel related expenses of million resulting from the accrual of retention bonuses in the fourth quarter of see description of retention bonuses under the heading overview above 
restructuring october restructuring 
on october   we initiated a plan to reduce our cost structure by eliminating positions  or of our staff  across all departments to reduce expenses 
this workforce reduction reflects our intention to reduce employee related costs  as well as our overall research and development and sales and marketing costs  in order to preserve existing cash and cash equivalents 
pursuant to the restructuring  we accrued charges of million in the quarter ended december  in connection with one time employee termination benefits  including severance and outplacement services 
we are in the process of assessing our current facility needs and could incur additional restructuring charges  in the form of write offs of leasehold improvements or other fixed assets  in the event facilities are consolidated 
until its facility plans are finalized  we can not currently estimate the amount of those charges  if any

facility consolidation costs also include one time real estate transaction fees in connection with the lease amendment to reduce the space occupied at our corporate headquarters 
interest income 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase in interest rates on investments held during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of  partially offset by lower average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  comparison of the years ended december  and revenue

research and development expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of actions taken in february to focus research and development efforts on improving the sensitivity and other performance aspects of our technologies and associated cost reductions 
as described under the heading restructuring below  we discontinued certain research efforts and reduced our workforce by ten employees  principally in the research and development functions

sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million in external marketing and promotional expenses partially offset by an increase of million in sales personnel and related costs as a result of the expansion of our sales force to conduct certain sales initiatives and to complement the direct sales efforts of labcorp 
in  we decided to focus the entirety of our sales and marketing efforts primarily on the following constituents thought leaders and third party payors  including self insured employers  managed care organizations  and the technology assessment groups within these organizations 
we began with twenty four sales and marketing employees and ended with seventeen employees in sales and marketing functions 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in professional fees of million resulting from lower legal  consulting and audit fees as well as a decrease of million in severance costs recorded in the year ended december  in connection with the departure of certain executives

stock based compensation  which is a non cash expense  was million for the years ended december  and stock based compensation for the year ended december  included million related to common stock awards and stock options granted to non employees  which are recorded at fair value based on the fair value measurement criteria of sfas no 
 million recorded in connection with our k plan employer match  which was made in common stock see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k and million related to the amortization of the difference between the exercise price and fair value of common stock on the date of grant for certain options granted prior to our initial public offering 
stock based compensation for the year ended december  included million related to the amortization of the difference between the exercise price and fair value of common stock on the date of grant for certain options granted prior to our initial public offering and million related to common stock awards and stock options granted to non employees 
interest income 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase in interest rates on investments held during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   partially offset by lower average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private sales of preferred stock  public offerings of common stock in february and february and cash received from labcorp in connection with our strategic alliance 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and million in restricted cash  which has been pledged as collateral for an outstanding letter of credit in connection with the lease for our marlborough  ma facility 
all of our investments in marketable securities are comprised of fixed income investments and all are deemed available for sale 
the objectives of this portfolio are to provide liquidity and safety of principal while striving to achieve the highest rate of return  consistent with these two objectives 
our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the principal use of cash in operating activities for each of the years ended december   and was to fund our net loss 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to decreases in sales and marketing and applied research spending as a result of cost reduction actions taken during which are discussed elsewhere in this report 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  as compared the year ended december  was primarily due to decreases in applied research and administrative expenses as a result of restructuring our operations during  as described elsewhere in this report 
cash flows from operations can vary significantly due to various factors  including changes in our operations  prepaid expenses  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to net provided by investing activities of million in and net cash used in investing activities of million in excluding the impact of purchases and maturities of marketable securities  net cash used in investing activities was million in each of the years ended december   and purchases of property and equipment of million during the year ended december  were materially consistent with purchases of property and equipment of and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect that purchases of property and equipment during will be substantially consistent with the amounts invested during we continued to invest in our patent portfolio for the year ended december  and we expect that investments made in our patent portfolio during will be substantially consistent with the million invested during net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and included million and million  respectively  in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock option and purchase plans 
also included in net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was an decrease in restricted cash of approximately million as a result of a reduction in the amount of collateral required in connection with the lease for our offices in marlborough  ma 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million and was primarily due to the offering of million shares of our common stock in february  which generated net proceeds to us of approximately million  as well as million in repayment of notes receivable and million in proceeds from issuances of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
assuming no material cash outlays relating to a shift in our strategic direction or entry into new markets  we expect that cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand at december  will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least the next twelve months  based upon our current operational plan following the restructuring actions taken in october we do not expect that product royalty payments from labcorp will materially supplement our liquidity position in the next twelve months given that  among other things  a determination has not yet been made regarding the inclusion of stool based dna screening in colorectal cancer screening guidelines  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms have not approved stool based dna colorectal cancer screening for payment and no payors have issued formal broad policy approving payment for stool based dna screening 
although milestone and other performance based payments from labcorp for which we may be eligible under our strategic agreement may supplement our liquidity position  the timing and receipt of milestone and performance based payments is unpredictable at this time 
of the remaining million of payments for which we may be eligible under our amended agreement with labcorp  million relates to milestone payments associated with the inclusion of stool based dna testing for colorectal cancer into certain clinical guidelines and policy level reimbursement approvals that  in large part  depend upon decisions to be made by third parties 
the remaining million relates to the achievement of certain significant cumulative labcorp revenue thresholds that depend upon labcorp s widespread success with respect to its sales of pregen plus 
because these milestones are not expected in the foreseeable future  if at all  no assurance can be given that any payments pursuant to our agreement with labcorp will be sufficient or timely enough to meet our liquidity needs 
in addition  we continue to selectively explore potential acquisitions or licensing of technologies to broaden our technology portfolio 
if revenue and other payments from labcorp are insufficient to meet our liquidity needs  if we change our strategic direction or pursue an acquisition of new technologies  or if we determine that our sales  marketing or research and development expenses must increase to achieve our goals  we will be required to raise additional capital or further reduce the scale of our operations  or both 
the table below reflects our estimated fixed obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period less than more than description total one year years years years in thousands obligations under license and collaborative agreements operating lease obligations retention bonus obligations in connection with employment agreements purchase obligations total obligations under license and collaboration agreements represent on going commitments under various research collaborations and licensing agreements 
commitments under license agreements generally expire concurrent with the expiration of the intellectual property licensed from the third party 
operating leases reflect remaining obligations associated with leased facilities in marlborough  massachusetts 
retention bonus obligations represent commitments to our remaining employees following our october restructuring  as well as obligations under our employment agreement with don hardison  our president and chief executive officer 
purchase obligations primarily represent commitments associated with our research and development activities 
we do not have any special purpose entities or any other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
our future capital requirements include  but are not limited to  continued funding of our research and development efforts  product development and potential fda submissions  potential clinical studies required for such fda submissions  potential in licensing of new technology for commercial development  sales and marketing efforts associated with the commercialization of stool based dna screening technologies  purchases of laboratory equipment and continued investment in our intellectual property estate 
our future capital requirements may depend on many factors  including the following the inclusion of stool based dna screening in colorectal cancer screening guidelines of major guidelines organizations including the acs mstf crc and the timing thereof  the regulatory requirements for pregen plus  or other stool based dna testing services utilizing our technologies  and the timing of any required regulatory approval process  acceptance  endorsement and formal policy approval of stool based dna screening for reimbursement by medicare and other third party payors  our ability to achieve milestones under our strategic agreement with labcorp  a determination that additional studies surrounding our technologies are needed  a sustained level of interest and commitment by labcorp in the commercialization of pregen plus  stool based dna screening becoming a standard of care among prescribing physicians  the scope of and progress made in our research and development activities  the successful commercialization and sales growth of pregen plus  or other stool based dna testing services utilizing our technologies  and a shift in our strategic direction or entry into new markets 
until such time as some or all of the factors outlined above are in place  we do not expect material revenue growth 
moreover  if stool based dna screening is not included in colorectal cancer screening guidelines of one or more major organizations issuing guidelines recommendations  or if inclusion or notification of inclusion in such screening guidelines is significantly delayed  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected and our business direction may change 
in such event  we would likely be required to further significantly curtail our operations 
we cannot assure you that our business will ever generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or that we will be able to liquidate our investments or obtain financing when needed or desirable 
while we may  from time to time  seek to access the capital markets  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any future capital raising efforts  or that we would be able to raise additional funds at an acceptable price level 
an inability to fund our operations would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through  if not utilized 
the internal revenue code and applicable state laws impose substantial restrictions on a corporation s utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards if an ownership change is deemed to have occurred 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
in general  companies that have a history of operating losses are faced with a difficult burden of proof on their ability to generate sufficient future income within the next two years in order to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation against our deferred tax assets based on our history of losses 
the deferred tax assets are still available for us to use in the future to offset taxable income  which would result in the recognition of tax benefit and a reduction to our effective tax rate 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is principally confined to its cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in securities of the us governments and its agencies and in investment grade  highly liquid investments consisting of commercial paper  bank certificates of deposit and corporate bonds  all of which are currently invested in the u 
s and are classified as available for sale 
we place our cash equivalents and marketable securities with high quality financial institutions  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution and have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of risk sensitive financial instruments  and cash flows are immaterial  although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis
