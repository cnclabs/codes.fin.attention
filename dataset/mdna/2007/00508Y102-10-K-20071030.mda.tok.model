table of contents 
index to financial statements prior to the spin off  the company engaged in an internal restructuring  including a holding company reorganization 
as part of the internal restructuring  the business that had previously been conducted by acuity specialty products group  inc was merged into its parent company and was subsequently transferred to acuity specialty products  inc asp 
asp is now a wholly owned subsidiary of zep inc  which is in turn a direct  wholly owned subsidiary of acuity brands  inc zep inc zep will be listed on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol zep 
acuity brands expects to distribute pro rata to its stockholders all of the shares of zep common stock by means of a stock dividend on october  the stock dividend of one share of zep common stock for every two shares of acuity brands common stock will be paid pro rata to holders of acuity brands common stock who hold their shares at the close of business on october   which is the record date for the distribution 
no fractional shares of zep common stock will be distributed 
instead of fractional shares  zep stockholders will receive cash 
following the distribution  acuity brands will not own any shares of zep  and zep will be an independent public company 
the spin off is intended to be tax free to affected shareholders  and the company has received a favorable ruling from the internal revenue service as well as a favorable opinion of external tax counsel supporting the spin off s tax free status 
to facilitate the separation of zep inc from its parent  acuity brands will provide certain services to zep inc during a transition period following completion of the spin off 
additionally  the company and zep inc will enter into commercially reasonable service agreements in the normal course of business

consolidated working capital at august  was million compared with million at august   an increase of million 
the increase in working capital in compared with was due primarily to the million increase in cash and cash equivalents  partially offset by a million decrease in inventory and a million increase in other current liabilities 
almost half of the increase in other current liabilities was attributable to taxes payable  and the primary components of the remainder of the difference have been discussed above 
the decrease in inventory was achieved through the successful implementation of certain inventory management initiatives at select locations of both the lighting and chemical businesses  and was aided by record selling performance in the last quarter of fiscal operating working capital decreased by approximately million to million at august  from million at august  decreased operating working capital levels resulted from the successful implementation of inventory and payables management initiatives coupled with continued favorable development of receivables collections 
operating working capital as a percentage of net sales at the end of fiscal decreased to from in fiscal at august   the current ratio calculated as total current assets divided by total current liabilities of the company was compared with at august  during the course of the previous five years  acuity specialty products annual contribution to its parent company s aggregate operating and investing cash flows has averaged million amount is net of estimated corporate overhead costs

the distribution agreement further provides that after the spin off  acuity brands will remit to zep inc an amount equal to the positive net cash flow generated by zep inc during the period from september  until the distribution date less any cash in excess of million held by zep inc on the distribution date

the benefit from the absence of the special charge was more than offset by an increase in incentive compensation  including expense related to share based compensation 
the increase in share based compensation expense was due primarily to the effect of higher current year stock price appreciation on company wide restricted stock incentives and other share based programs and to increased expense related to the company s adoption of sfas no

financial impact of spin off of specialty products business in acuity brands acted upon a key objective to create greater strategic clarity by narrowing the focus of the organization to markets where it enjoys clear competitive advantages and where it believes it can more effectively allocate its considerable resources to fully capitalize on opportunities within those markets 
with that goal in mind  acuity brands announced plans in july to separate the lighting and specialty chemical businesses by spinning off acuity specialty products into an independent public company 
during the past five years  acuity specialty products annual contribution to its parent s operating cash flows  net of investing activity  has averaged approximately million 
the specialty products business has been responsible for approximately of the consolidated parent company s revenues over that period 
additionally  the acuity specialty products business has contributed to the profitability of the consolidated entity  the specialty products group s operating profit and operating profit margins during the previous five years have averaged approximately million and  respectively excluding any allocation of corporate costs 
in acuity brands  with 
table of contents 
index to financial statements acuity brands lighting as its sole operating subsidiary  will proceed without the benefit from operations previously conducted by acuity specialty products 
however  acuity brands believes that by separating its lighting and chemical businesses  each business will be better able to tailor its own investment strategy to its individual cash flows and capital structure  while creating tighter alignment between the performance of each business and the expectations of its stockholders 
on october  the distribution date  acuity brands will enter into a distribution agreement with zep inc the distribution agreement will provide for the principal corporate transactions required to affect the spin off 
pursuant to this distribution agreement  zep inc will draw upon its credit facilities and remit a dividend to acuity brands in the amount of million on the distribution date 
acuity brands intends to use proceeds from this dividend to fund currently authorized share repurchases or to reduce its outstanding indebtedness 
the distribution agreement further provides that after the spin off  acuity brands will remit to zep inc an amount equal to the positive net cash flow generated by zep inc during the period from september  until the distribution date less any cash in excess of million held by zep inc on the distribution date 
therefore  effective september   acuity brands will cease to benefit from positive operating cash flow generated by the specialty products business 
as a result of the spin off of the specialty products business  certain corporate costs previously incurred by acuity brands  inc will be eliminated 
additionally  subsequent to the distribution  the company  with abl as its sole operating subsidiary  intends to simplify its structure with the intent to reduce certain consolidated costs of the corporate office and abl 
the company expects to record a special charge in the first quarter of fiscal year related to this simplification of organizational structure  due primarily to the reduction of personnel and the early termination costs associated with vacating leased office space 
while the amount of the charge has not yet been finalized  it is expected to total at least million on a pre tax basis 
the company estimates that  on an annual basis  cost reductions resulting from the spin off and the simplification of the organizational structure will be at least million 
the benefit from these measures will most likely not be fully realized until two years following the spin off 
management expects to conclude this review of its organizational structure  along with associated costs and benefits  during the first quarter of fiscal also  the company expects to incur in the first quarter of fiscal additional professional fees and other non recurring costs related to the spin off of approximately million 
outlook the consolidated results of acuity brands for the year ended august   reflect benefits from favorable pricing strategies required to offset continued increases in costs  including certain raw materials and component parts  as well as programs designed to improve customer service and productivity  additional sales of higher margin products  and greater sales volume 
acuity brands ability to successfully execute these programs along with other continuous improvement initiatives allowed the company to again deliver record operating results to its shareholders 
looking forward to fiscal and beyond  management is optimistic about the future prospects of acuity brands  with acuity brands lighting as its sole operating subsidiary 
however  in the shorter term the company expects to face challenges such as continued cost pressures for certain raw materials  component parts  fuel  and employee related matters including health care 
also  acuity brands is highly dependent on the non residential  and  to a lesser degree  the residential construction markets  which may be significantly impacted by the turmoil in the global credit markets during the summer and fall of a key factor in delivering positive results in while facing these external challenges will be management s ability to continue to execute on and realize benefit from investments in programs intended to drive future profitable growth  including those that enhance customer service  improve productivity  expand access to market  and allow for the innovation of new products 
while these shorter term challenges may be considerable  management continues to be optimistic regarding its continued ability to deliver increasing value to shareholders in through the profitable growth

index to financial statements opportunities at acuity brands lighting  its sole operating business 
a number of existing factors support the position that volume within the non residential construction market could grow in the low single digits during fiscal for example  the recent rebound in non residential building awards and other measures such as the architecture billings index suggest demand for lighting fixtures will continue it positive trend 
other current conditions supporting a positive long term growth trend in the non residential construction market include  but are not limited to  favorable trends in commercial vacancy and rent rates  as well as increased government spending on infrastructure projects such as highways  though these have recently begun to level off 
acuity brands lighting is encouraged by success attained in and the opportunity afforded by the retrofit market as its commercial  retail  and industrial customers become increasingly interested in more efficient lighting fixtures that serve to reduce energy consumption while creating an enhanced aesthetic environment 
management will continue to proactively position acuity brands lighting to better leverage abl s market presence through investments that enhance its go to market programs and strengthen its geographic footprint  which should aid in generating new unit sales volume 
with proper execution and the continuation of positive growth within the non residential construction sector  acuity brands expects to continue to grow in key markets by accelerating new product introductions and improving service and quality 
assuming no dramatic change in the current condition of the company s key markets  management expects in fiscal to meet or exceed its long term financial goals of generating consolidated operating profit margins in excess of  growing diluted earnings per share in excess of  providing a return on stockholder s equity of or better  and generating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures in excess of net income

on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventory valuation  depreciation  amortization and the recoverability of long lived assets  including intangible assets  share based compensation expense  medical  product warranty  and other reserves  litigation  and environmental matters 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its substantial historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management discusses the development of accounting estimates with the company s audit committee 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the accounting policies of acuity brands 
the management of acuity brands believes the following represent the company s critical accounting estimates inventories inventories include materials  direct labor  and related manufacturing overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out or average cost basis or market 
management reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on estimated future demand and current market conditions 
a significant change in customer demand or market conditions could render certain inventory obsolete and thus could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results in the period the change occurs 
long lived and intangible assets and goodwill acuity brands reviews goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of the long lived asset below its carrying value 
all other long lived and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods 
the evaluation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires management to use significant judgments and estimates including  but not limited to  projected future net sales  operating results  and cash flow of each of the company s businesses 
although management currently believes that the estimates used in the evaluation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are reasonable  differences between actual and expected net sales  operating results  and cash flow could cause these assets to be deemed impaired 
if this were to occur  the company would be required to charge to earnings the write down in value of such assets  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position  but not its cash flow from operations 
specifically  acuity brands has three unamortized trade names with an aggregate carrying value of approximately million 
management estimates the fair value of these unamortized trade names using a fair value model based on discounted future cash flows 
future cash flows associated with each of the company s unamortized trade names are calculated by applying a theoretical royalty rate a willing third party would pay for use of the particular trade name to estimated future net sales 
the present value of the resulting after tax cash flow is management s current estimate of the fair value of the trade names 
this fair value model requires management to make several significant assumptions  including estimated future net sales  the royalty rate  and the discount rate 
differences between expected and actual results can result in significantly different valuations 
if future operating results are unfavorable compared with forecasted amounts  the company may be required to reduce the theoretical royalty rate used in the fair value model 
a reduction in the theoretical royalty rate would result in lower expected  future after tax cash flow in the valuation model 
accordingly  an impairment charge would be

self insurance it is the policy of acuity brands to self insure  up to certain limits  traditional risks including workers compensation  comprehensive general liability  and auto liability 
the company s self insured retention for each claim involving workers compensation  comprehensive general liability including toxic tort and other product liability claims  and auto liability is limited to million per occurrence of such claims 
a provision for claims under this self insured program  based on the company s estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred  is revised and recorded annually 
the estimate is derived from both internal and external sources including but not limited to the company s independent actuary 
acuity brands is also self insured up to certain limits for certain other insurable risks  primarily physical loss to property million per occurrence and business interruptions resulting from such loss lasting three days or more in duration 
insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
acuity brands is fully self insured for certain other types of liabilities  including employment practices  environmental  product recall  and patent infringement and errors and omissions 
the actuarial estimates are subject to uncertainty from various sources  including  among others  changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  legislation  and economic conditions 
although acuity brands believes that the actuarial estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect the company s self insurance obligations  future expense and cash flow 
the company is also self insured for the majority of its medical benefit plans 
the company estimates its aggregate liability for claims incurred by applying a lag factor to the company s historical claims and administrative cost experience 
the appropriateness of the company s lag factor is evaluated and revised  if necessary  annually 
although management believes that the current estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to claim reporting patterns  plan designs  legislation  and general economic conditions could materially affect the company s medical benefit plan liabilities  future expense and cash flow

results for prior periods have not been restated 
the company continues to account for any awards with graded vesting on a straight line basis 
sfas no 
r does not specify a preference for a type of valuation model to be used when measuring fair value of share based payments  and the company continues to employ the black scholes model in deriving the fair value estimates of such awards 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures of share based awards to be estimated at time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates 

table of contents 
index to financial statements therefore  expense related to share based payments recognized in fiscal and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the company s assumptions used in the black scholes model remain otherwise unaffected by the implementation of this pronouncement

that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
as of august   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options

product warranty acuity brands records an allowance for the estimated amount of future warranty costs when the related revenue is recognized  primarily based on historical experience of identified warranty claims 
excluding costs related to recalls due to faulty components provided by third parties  historical warranty costs have been within expectations 
however  there can be no assurance that future warranty costs will not exceed historical amounts 
if actual future warranty costs exceed historical amounts  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results and cash flow in future periods 
litigation acuity brands recognizes expense for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulty in estimating costs of resolving legal claims  actual costs may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved 
environmental matters the company recognizes expense for known environmental claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
the actual cost of resolving environmental issues may be higher or lower than that reserved primarily due to difficulty in estimating such costs and potential changes in the status of government regulations 
the company is self insured for most environmental matters

acuity brands is exposed to market risks that may impact the consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations  and consolidated statements of cash flows due primarily to changing interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the following discussion provides additional information regarding the market risks of acuity brands 
interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations expose the variable rate debt of acuity brands to changes in interest expense and cash flows 
the variable rate debt of acuity brands  primarily long term industrial revenue bonds  amounted to million at august  based on outstanding borrowings at year end  a increase in market interest rates at august   would have resulted in a de minimus amount of additional annual after tax interest expense 
a fluctuation in interest rates would not affect interest expense or cash flows related to the million publicly traded fixed rate notes  the company s primary debt 
a increase in market interest rates at august   would have decreased the fair value of these notes by approximately million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in this form k  for additional information regarding the company s long term debt 
foreign exchange rates 
the majority of net sales  expense  and capital purchases of acuity brands are transacted in us dollars 
however  exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuation exists due to the company s operations in canada  where a portion of products sold are sourced from the united states 
a hypothetical decline in the canadian dollar of would negatively impact operating profit by approximately million 
also  a portion of the goods sold in the united states are manufactured in mexico 
a hypothetical increase in the mexican peso would negatively impact operating profits by approximately million 
the impact of these hypothetical currency fluctuations has been calculated in isolation from any response the company would undertake to address such exchange rate changes in the company s foreign markets
