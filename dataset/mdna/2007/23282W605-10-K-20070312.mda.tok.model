item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company  incorporated in delaware in  focused on developing small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and cancer 
our development efforts are directed to advancing multiple drug candidates through clinical trials to demonstrate proof of concept in humans in two significant markets heart failure and cancer 
our drug development pipeline consists of a drug candidate for the treatment of heart failure  being developed in both an intravenous and oral formulation  and two drug candidates and a potential drug candidate for the treatment of cancer 
our drug candidates and potential drug candidates are all novel small molecules that arose from our internal research programs and are directed toward the biology of the cytoskeleton 
we believe our understanding of the cytoskeleton has enabled us to discover novel and potentially safer and more effective therapeutics 
cardiovascular program our drug candidate  ck  a novel cardiac myosin activator for the treatment of heart failure  completed a phase i clinical trial designed to evaluate its safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic profile when administered intravenously in healthy volunteers 
we plan to initiate a phase ii clinical trials program for this drug candidate in early 
table of contents in december  we completed a phase i oral bioavailability clinical trial of ck in healthy volunteers 
we believe that this data supports our current efforts to develop a modified release oral formulation of ck to enable late stage clinical development of a dosing schedule that may be suitable for the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure 
in december  we entered into a collaboration and option agreement with amgen to discover  develop and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics that activate cardiac muscle contractility for the potential application in the treatment of heart failure 
the agreement grants amgen an option to participate in the future development and commercialization of ck in both intravenous and oral formulations 
the collaboration is worldwide  excluding japan 
if amgen elects not to exercise its option on ck  worldwide development and commercialization rights for ck would revert back to us and the research collaboration would terminate 
oncology program ispinesib  our most advanced drug candidate  has been the subject of a broad phase ii clinical trials program conducted by gsk and the national cancer institute  or nci  designed to evaluate its effectiveness in multiple tumor types 
we believe that data from this ongoing clinical trials program has yielded a greater understanding of this drug candidate s clinical potential 
we have reported phase ii clinical trial data from this program in metastatic breast  non small cell lung  colorectal and head and neck cancer 
to date  clinical activity for ispinesib has been observed only in non small cell lung cancer and breast cancer  with the more robust clinical activity observed in a phase ii clinical trial evaluating ispinesib in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients that had failed treatment with taxanes and anthracyclines 
we intend to conduct a focused development program for ispinesib  at our expense  in the treatment of patients with breast cancer  and to initiate a phase i ii monotherapy clinical trial evaluating ispinesib in the first line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in the first half of sb  our second drug candidate for the treatment of cancer  is the subject of a phase i ii clinical trial in non hodgkin s lymphoma initiated by us in april of gsk  our potential drug candidate for the treatment of cancer  is currently in preclinical development under our strategic alliance with gsk 
gsk is preparing a regulatory filing  and plans to initiate a phase i clinical trial in ispinesib  sb and gsk are being developed under our strategic alliance with gsk  which is focused on novel small molecule therapeutics targeting human mitotic kinesins for applications in the treatment of cancer and other diseases 
pursuant to our november amendment to the collaboration and license agreement  we have assumed responsibility for the continued development of ispinesib and sb  at our expense  and subject to gsk s option to resume responsibility for some or all development and commercialization activities associated with either or both of these novel drug candidates during a defined period 
if gsk does not exercise its option for either ispinesib or sb  we will be obligated to pay royalties to gsk on the sales of any resulting products 
the november amendment supersedes a previous amendment to the collaboration agreement dated september  which specifically related to sb cytokinetics and gsk continue to conduct collaborative research activities directed to inhibitors of centromere associated protein e  or cenp e  including gsk  pursuant to a june amendment to the strategic alliance 
we are also pursuing other early research programs addressing a number of therapeutic areas 
since our inception in august  we have incurred significant net losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years if and to the extent we advance ck through clinical development for the treatment of heart failure and amgen does not exercise its option to participate in later stage development and commercialization  we conduct continued phase ii and later stage development and commercialization of ispinesib  sb or gsk under our collaboration and license agreement with gsk  as amended  
table of contents we exercise our option to co fund the development of gsk or of any other drug candidate being developed by gsk under our strategic alliance  we exercise our option to co promote any of the products for which we have elected co fund development under our strategic alliance with gsk  we advance other potential drug candidates into clinical trials  we expand our research programs and further develop our proprietary drug discovery technologies  or we elect to fund development or commercialization of any drug candidate 
we intend to pursue selective strategic alliances to enable us to maintain financial and operational flexibility 
cardiovascular we have focused our cardiovascular research and development activities on heart failure  a disease most often characterized by compromised contractile function of the heart that impacts its ability to effectively pump blood throughout the body 
we have discovered and optimized small molecules that have the potential to clinically improve cardiac contractility by specifically binding to and activating cardiac myosin  a cytoskeletal protein essential for cardiac muscle contraction 
ck intravenous in  we selected ck  a novel cardiac myosin activator for the treatment of heart failure  as a drug candidate for further development in our cardiovascular program and we initiated a first in humans phase i clinical trial 
this clinical trial was designed as a double blind  randomized  placebo controlled  dose escalation clinical trial to investigate the safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ck administered as a six hour intravenous infusion to normal healthy volunteers 
clinical data for ck were presented at the heart failure society of america meeting in september the maximum tolerated dose  or mtd  was mg kg hr for this regimen 
at this dose  the six hour infusion of ck produced statistically significant mean increases in left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening of and absolute percentage points  respectively  as compared to placebo 
these increases in indices of left ventricular function were associated with a mean prolongation of systolic ejection time of milliseconds  which was also statistically significant 
these mean changes in ejection fraction  fractional shortening and ejection time were concentration dependent and ck exhibited generally linear  dose proportional pharmacokinetics across the range of doses studied 
at the mtd  ck was well tolerated when compared to placebo 
the adverse effects at intolerable doses in humans appeared similar to the adverse findings observed in the preclinical safety studies which occurred at similar plasma concentrations 
these effects are believed to be related to an excess of the intended pharmacologic effect  resulting in excessive prolongation of the systolic ejection time  and resolved promptly with discontinuation of the infusions of ck the phase i clinical trial activity of ck is consistent with results from preclinical models that evaluated ck in normal dogs  however  further clinical trials are necessary to determine whether similar results will also be seen in patients with heart failure 
we anticipate initiating a phase ii clinical trials program in early expected to be comprised of at least two phase iia clinical trials in stable heart failure patients 
we also anticipate initiating additional phase i clinical trials in special patient populations in ck oral in december  we announced results from a phase i oral bioavailability study of ck in healthy volunteers 
we believe that this data supports our current efforts to develop a modified release oral formulation of ck to enable late stage clinical development of a dosing schedule that may be suitable for the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure 
this study was designed as an open label  four way crossover study in ten healthy volunteers designed to investigate the absolute bioavailability of two oral formulations liquid and immediate release solid formulations of ck versus an intravenous dose 
in addition  the effect of taking the immediate release solid formulation in a fed versus fasted state on ck s relative bioavailability was also assessed 
volunteers were administered ck at mg kg under each of four different conditions in random order i a reference intravenous infusion at a constant rate over one hour  ii a liquid solution taken orally 
table of contents in a fasted state  iii an immediate release solid formulation taken orally in a fasted state  and iv an immediate release solid formulation taken orally following consumption of a standard  high fat breakfast 
pharmacokinetic data from this study demonstrated oral bioavailability of approximately for each of the three conditions of oral administration 
the median time to maximum plasma concentrations after dosing was hours for the liquid solution taken orally  hour for the immediate release solid formulation taken in a fasted state  and hours for the immediate release solid formulation taken after eating 
the rapid and essentially complete oral absorption observed between subjects suggests that predictable plasma levels can be achieved with chronic oral dosing in patients with heart failure 
we expect that it will take several years before we can commercialize ck  if at all 
ck is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if and when we will be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from any resulting drugs 
accordingly  we cannot reasonably estimate when and to what extent ck will generate revenues or material net cash flows  which may vary widely depending on numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the safety and efficacy profile of the drug  receipt of regulatory approvals  market acceptance  then prevailing reimbursement policies  competition and other market conditions 
to date  we have funded all research and development costs associated with this program and will continue to conduct all development activities for ck at our own expense subject to amgen s option and according to an agreed development plan under our strategic alliance 
we incurred costs of approximately million  million and million for research and development activities relating to our cardiovascular program in the years ended december   and  respectively and incurred million in expenses from inception through december  our collaboration and option agreement with amgen also provides for us to fund development activities through exercise of their option and also provides us the opportunity to co fund later stage development activities associated with ck and related compounds 
if amgen elects not to exercise its option on ck  we may then proceed to independently develop ck we anticipate that our expenditures relating to research and development of compounds in our cardiovascular program will increase significantly as we advance ck through phase iia clinical development 
our expenditures will also increase if amgen does not exercise its option and we elect to develop ck or related compounds independently  or if we elect to co fund later stage development of ck or other compounds in our cardiovascular program under the collaboration following amgen s exercise of its option 
oncology in  in connection with our strategic alliance with the gsk  we continued our oncology development program for both ispinesib and sb  which are both directed to kinesin spindle protein  or ksp  a mitotic kinesin 
we also entered into two amendments to our collaboration and license agreement with gsk regarding the future research  development and commercialization of ispinesib  sb and cenp e 
in june  we amended the agreement to extend the initial five year research term of this strategic alliance for an additional year to continue activities focused towards translational research directed to cenp e 
in november  we further amended the agreement and assumed  at our expense  responsibility for the continued research  development and commercialization of inhibitors of ksp  including ispinesib and sb  and other mitotic kinesins  other than cenp e 
ispinesib the oncology clinical trials program for ispinesib is a broad program consisting of nine phase ii clinical trials and eight phase i or ib clinical trials evaluating the use of ispinesib in a variety of both solid and hematologic cancers 
we believe that the breadth of this clinical trials program takes into consideration the potential and complexity of developing a drug candidate such as ispinesib 
we have reported phase ii clinical trial data for ispinesib in metastatic breast  non small cell lung  colorectal and head and neck cancer 
to date  clinical activity for ispinesib has been observed only in non small cell lung cancer and breast cancer  with the more robust clinical activity observed in a phase ii clinical trial evaluating ispinesib in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients that had failed treatment with taxanes and anthracyclines 
under the amended collaboration and license agreement  we intend to conduct a focused development program for ispinesib in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
this program is intended to build upon the previous data from the clinical 
table of contents trials conducted by gsk and the nci  and would be designed to further define the clinical activity profile of ispinesib in advanced breast cancer patients in preparation for potentially initiating a phase iii clinical trial of ispinesib for the second line treatment of advanced breast cancer 
phase ii clinical trials of ispinesib  sponsored by gsk through our strategic alliance  or by the nci are as follows breast cancer gsk concluded enrollment  after enrolling patients  in a two stage  international  phase ii  open label  monotherapy clinical trial  evaluating the safety and efficacy of ispinesib in the second or third line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose disease has recurred or progressed despite treatment with anthracyclines and taxanes 
the clinical trial s primary endpoint was objective response as determined using the response evaluation criteria in solid tumor  or recist criteria 
the best overall responses  as determined using the recist criteria  were confirmed partial responses observed among the first evaluable patients 
the most common adverse event was grade neutropenia 
this clinical trial employed a green dahlberg design  which requires the satisfaction of pre defined efficacy criteria in stage to allow advancement to stage of patient enrollment and treatment 
in this clinical trial  ispinesib demonstrated sufficient anti tumor activity to satisfy the pre defined efficacy criteria required to move forward to the second stage 
we anticipate additional data from stage of this clinical trial in the first half of  however  we have been informed by gsk of another confirmed partial response in one of the stage patients  for a total of confirmed partial responses among the first evaluable patients ovarian cancer gsk has concluded enrollment and continues to treat a patient in a phase ii  open label  monotherapy clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of ispinesib in the second line treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer previously treated with a platinum and taxane based regimen 
the primary endpoint of this clinical trial is objective response as determined using the recist criteria and blood serum levels of the tumor mass marker ca we anticipate interim data to be available in the first half of renal cell cancer in  the nci initiated an open label phase ii clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ispinesib as a second line treatment in patients with renal cell cancer 
the primary endpoint of this clinical trial is objective response as determined using the recist criteria 
we anticipate data to be available from stage of this clinical trial in prostate cancer the nci has concluded enrollment and all patients are off study drug in a phase ii clinical trial evaluating ispinesib in the second line treatment of patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer 
the primary endpoint is objective response as determined by blood serum levels of the tumor mass marker prostate specific antigen 
we anticipate interim data from this clinical trial to be available in the first half of hepatocellular cancer the nci has concluded enrollment and all patients are off study drug in an open label phase ii clinical trial evaluating ispinesib in the first line treatment of patients with hepatocellular cancer 
the primary endpoint is objective response as determined using the recist criteria 
we anticipate data from stage of this clinical trial to be available in the first half of melanoma the nci has concluded enrollment and treatment continues in an open label phase ii clinical trial evaluating ispinesib in the first line treatment of patients with melanoma who may have received adjuvant immunotherapy but no chemotherapy 
the primary endpoint is objective response as determined using the recist criteria 
we anticipate data from stage of this clinical trial to be available in head and neck cancer the clinical trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ispinesib in patients with recurrent and or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  who had received no more than one prior chemotherapy regimen 
this two stage clinical trial was designed to require a minimum of confirmed partial or complete response out of evaluable patients in stage in order to proceed to stage the clinical trial s primary endpoint was objective response as determined using the recist criteria 
a total of patients were enrolled 
at the interim analysis after stage of this clinical trial  the criteria for advancement to stage were not satisfied 
the most common grade or greater adverse event was neutropenia  occurring in of patients treated 
two patients died on study 
one death in a patient with a grade non neutropenic infection was attributed to progressive disease  the other  in a patient with four days of grade neutropenia  was attributed to pneumonia 

table of contents non small cell lung cancer gsk completed patient treatment in the platinum sensitive arm of a two arm  international  two stage  phase ii  open label  monotherapy clinical trial  designed originally to enroll up to patients in each arm 
this clinical trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ispinesib in the second line treatment of patients with either platinum sensitive or platinum refractory non small cell lung cancer 
in both the platinum sensitive and platinum refractory treatment arms  ispinesib did not satisfy the criteria for advancement to stage the best overall response in the platinum sensitive arm of this clinical trial was disease stabilization observed in of of evaluable patients  or 
in the overall patient population  the median time to disease progression was weeks  but in the patients whose best response was stable disease  median time to progression was weeks 
colorectal cancer the nci has concluded enrollment and patients remain on study drug in stage of a phase ii clinical trial evaluating ispinesib in the second line treatment of patients with colorectal cancer 
this open label  monotherapy clinical trial contains two arms that evaluate different dosing schedules of ispinesib 
in arm a  ispinesib was infused at mg m on days  and of a day schedule  and in arm b  ispinesib was infused at mg m every days 
the primary endpoint was objective response as determined using the recist criteria 
in this clinical trial  ispinesib did not manifest an objective response rate on either of the two schedules evaluated in heavily pretreated colorectal cancer patients 
the most common grade and toxicities in arm a included neutropenia  nausea  vomiting and fatigue 
the most common grade and toxicity in arm b was neutropenia  only one of which was febrile 
based on this clinical trial  the weekly dosing schedule in arm a appeared to have a more favorable tolerability profile compared to the dosing schedule in arm b 
in addition to the phase ii clinical trials  the phase i and ib clinical trials of ispinesib  sponsored by gsk through our strategic alliance  or by the nci are as follows combination therapy gsk also continued to conduct two phase ib clinical trials evaluating ispinesib in combination therapy 
these clinical trials are both dose escalating studies evaluating the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ispinesib  one in combination with carboplatin and the second in combination with capecitabine 
ispinesib with carboplatin 
data from gsk s phase ib clinical trial evaluating ispinesib in combination with carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors suggests that ispinesib  on a once every day schedule  has an acceptable tolerability profile and no apparent pharmacokinetic interactions when used in combination with carboplatin 
at the optimally tolerated regimen  ispinesib concentrations did not appear to be affected by carboplatin 
the best response was a partial response at cycle in one patient with breast cancer  a total of patients  or  had a best response of stable disease with durations ranging from to months 
all patients are now off treatment 
we anticipate additional data to be available in the first half of ispinesib with capecitabine 
in  we and gsk presented data from two phase ib combination clinical trials suggesting ispinesib had an acceptable tolerability profile and no pharmacokinetic interactions in patients with advanced solid tumors when used in combination with capecitabine or docetaxel 
in  clinical data were presented demonstrating that the combination of ispinesib and capecitabine may have an acceptable tolerability profile 
the optimally tolerated regimen in this clinical trial was not defined  however  the mtd of ispinesib at mg m  administered as an intravenous infusion every days  was tolerated with therapeutic doses of capecitabine  specifically daily oral doses of mg m and mg m for days  and plasma concentrations of ispinesib did not appear to be affected by the presence of capecitabine 
dose limiting toxicities consisted of grade rash that did not allow of the capecitabine doses to be delivered and prolonged grade neutropenia 
in this clinical trial  a total of patients had a best response of stable disease by the recist criteria 
a patient with breast cancer had the longest duration of stable disease of months 
gsk continues to treat a patient in the phase ib clinical trial of ispinesib in combination with capecitabine 
we anticipate data to be available in the first half of pediatric solid tumors in  the nci initiated a dose finding phase i clinical trial in approximately patients to evaluate ispinesib as monotherapy in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors 
this clinical trial is designed to investigate the safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of ispinesib in this patient population 

table of contents the nci has concluded enrollment and all patients are off treatment in a phase i clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ispinesib on an alternative dosing schedule in patients with advanced solid tumors who have failed to respond to all standard therapies 
the nci also continues to treat patients in a phase i clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ispinesib on an alternative dosing schedule in patients with acute leukemia  chronic myelogenous leukemia  or advanced myelodysplastic syndromes 
data from the clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors indicated that the most common grade and toxicities at doses ranging between mg m and mg m were neutropenia and at some doses leukopenia 
as a result  mg m was further evaluated as the potential mtd 
in this clinical trial  although not primary endpoints  investigators observed stable disease in two patients with renal cell carcinoma and a minor response in one patient with bladder cancer 
we anticipate data to be available from stage of the nci s phase i clinical trial of patients with acute leukemia  chronic myelogenous leukemia or advanced myelodysplastic syndromes in we expect that it will take several years before we can commercialize ispinesib  if at all 
ispinesib is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if and when we will be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from any resulting drugs 
accordingly  we cannot reasonably estimate when and to what extent ispinesib will generate revenues or material net cash flows  which may vary widely depending on numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the safety and efficacy profile of the drug  receipt of regulatory approvals  market acceptance  then prevailing reimbursement policies  competition and other market conditions 
we have assumed responsibility for funding the development costs associated with ispinesib pursuant to the november amendment to our collaboration and license agreement with gsk 
we intend to conduct a focused development program for ispinesib in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast designed to further define the clinical activity profile of ispinesib in advanced breast cancer patients  in preparation for potentially initiating a phase iii clinical trial of ispinesib for the second line treatment of advanced breast cancer 
as a result of this planned development activity  and if gsk does not exercise its option to resume responsibility for some or all of the development and commercialization activities associated with this drug candidate  our expenditures relating to research and development of this drug candidate will increase significantly 
in june  gsk announced data from a dose escalating phase i clinical trial evaluating the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetics of sb in advanced cancer patients 
the primary objectives of this clinical trial were to determine the dose limiting toxicities  or dlts  and to establish the mtd of sb secondary objectives included assessment of the safety and tolerability of sb  characterization of the pharmacokinetics of sb on this schedule and a preliminary assessment of its antitumor activity 
the recommended phase ii dose of sb on the day schedule was mg m  although dosing did reach mg m the observed toxicities at the recommended phase ii dose were manageable 
dlts in this clinical trial consisted predominantly of neutropenia and elevations in hepatic enzymes and bilirubin 
disease stabilization  ranging from to weeks  was observed in seven patients 
one patient with cholangiocarcinoma had a confirmed partial response at the mtd at cycle we continue to enroll patients in a phase i ii clinical trial of sb in patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma  or nhl 
this phase i ii clinical trial is an open label  non randomized clinical trial designed to investigate the safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of sb administered as a one hour infusion on days and of a day schedule  first without and then with the administration of granulocyte colony stimulating factor  and then to assess the potential efficacy of the mtd 
phase i data from this clinical trial are anticipated to be available in the clinical trials program for sb may proceed for several years  and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from this drug candidate until the program is successfully completed  regulatory approval is achieved  and a drug is commercialized 
sb is at too early a stage of development for us to predict when or if this may occur 
the november amendment to our collaboration and license agreement with gsk provides for us to fund the future development of sb in all cancer indications subject to gsk s option to resume responsibility for some or all development and commercialization activities 
as a result of this amendment  our expenditures relating to research and development of this drug candidate will increase significantly 
if gsk exercises its option for either or both of ispinesib and sb  it will pay us an option fee equal to the costs we independently incurred for that drug candidate  plus a premium intended to compensate us for the cost 
table of contents of capital associated with such costs  subject to an agreed limit for such costs and premium 
upon gsk exercising its option for a drug candidate  we may receive additional pre commercialization milestone payments with respect to such drug candidate and increased royalties on net sales of any resulting product  in each case  beyond those contemplated under the original agreement 
gsk in june  we executed an amendment to our collaboration and license agreement with gsk whereby the research term was extended for an additional year to facilitate continued research activities under an updated research plan focused on another mitotic kinesin and novel cancer target cenp e 
the research term under the collaboration and license agreement with respect to all mitotic kinesins other than cenp e expired in june under the amendment  gsk will have no obligation to reimburse us for full time employee equivalents  or ftes  during the extension of the research term 
gsk continues to develop gsk under the agreement 
we anticipate that gsk will file a regulatory filing for gsk in the first half of and begin clinical trials in we will receive royalties from gsk s sales of any drugs developed under the strategic alliance 
for those drug candidates that gsk develops under the strategic alliance  which currently includes gsk and which may include either or both of ispinesib and sb if so elected by gsk pursuant to its option  we can elect to co fund certain later stage development activities which would increase our potential royalty rates on sales of resulting drugs and provide us with the option to secure co promotion rights in north america 
we expect that the royalties to be paid on future sales of each of ispinesib  sb and gsk could potentially increase to an upper teen percentage rate based on increasing product sales and our anticipated level of co funding 
if we exercise our co promotion option  then we are entitled to receive reimbursement from gsk for certain sales force costs we incur in support of our commercial activities 
development risks the successful development of all of our drug candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot estimate with certainty or know the exact nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of any of our drug candidates or the date of completion of these development efforts 
we cannot estimate with certainty any of the foregoing due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing our drug candidates  including  but not limited to the uncertainty of the timing of the initiation and completion of patient enrollment in our clinical trials  the possibility of delays in the collection of clinical trial data and the uncertainty of the timing of the analyses of our clinical trial data after such trials have been initiated and completed  the possibility of delays in characterization  synthesis or optimization of potential drug candidates in our cardiovascular program  delays in developing appropriate formulations of our drug candidates for clinical trial use  the uncertainty of clinical trial results  the uncertainty of obtaining fda or other foreign regulatory agency approval required for new therapies  and the uncertainty related to the development of commercial scale manufacturing processes and qualification of a commercial scale manufacturing facility 
if we fail to complete the development of any of our drug candidates in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
in addition  any failure by us or our partners to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals for our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
a further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our programs on schedule  or at all  and certain consequences of failing to do so are discussed further in the risk factors entitled we have never generated  and may never generate  revenues from commercial sales of our drugs and we may not have drugs to market for at least several years  if ever  clinical trials may fail to demonstrate 
table of contents the desired safety and efficacy of our drug candidates  which could prevent or significantly delay completion of clinical development and regulatory approval and clinical trials are expensive  time consuming and subject to delay  as well as other risk factors 
revenues our current revenue sources are limited  and we do not expect to generate any direct revenue from product sales for several years 
we have recognized revenues from our strategic alliances with gsk and astra zeneca for contract research activities  which we recorded as related expenses were incurred 
charges to gsk were based on negotiated rates intended to approximate the costs for our ftes performing research under the strategic alliance and our out of pocket expenses 
gsk paid us an upfront licensing fee  which we recognized ratably over the strategic alliance s initial five year research term  which ended in june we may receive additional payments from gsk upon achieving certain precommercialization milestones 
milestone payments are non refundable and are recognized as revenue when earned  as evidenced by achievement of the specified milestones and the absence of ongoing performance obligations 
we record amounts received in advance of performance as deferred revenue 
the revenues recognized to date are not refundable  even if the relevant research effort is not successful 
under the terms of our collaboration and option agreement with amgen  they will pay us an upfront  non refundable license and technology access fee of million  which we will recognize ratably over the maximum term of the non exclusive license  which is four years 
we may receive additional payments from amgen upon achieving certain precommercialization and commercialization milestones 
milestone payments are non refundable and are recognized as revenue when earned  as evidenced by achievement of the specified milestones and the absence of ongoing performance obligations 
we may also be eligible to receive reimbursement for contract development activities subsequent to amgen s option exercise  which we will record as revenue when the related expenses are incurred 
we record amounts received in advance of performance as deferred revenue 
charges to astrazeneca were based on negotiated rates intended to approximate the costs for our ftes performing research under the strategic alliance 
the revenues recognized to date are not refundable 
the research term of our collaboration and license agreement with astrazeneca expired in december  and we formally terminated that agreement in august because a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will depend on achieving development and other precommercialization milestones under our strategic alliances with gsk and amgen  our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year 
we expect that our future revenues ultimately will most likely be derived from royalties on sales from drugs licensed to gsk or amgen under our strategic alliances and from those licensed to future partners  as well as from direct sales of our drugs 
if amgen exercises its option  we will retain a product by product option to co fund certain later stage development activities under that strategic alliance with amgen  thereby potentially increasing our royalties and affording us co promotion rights in north america 
for those products being developed by gsk under our strategic alliance  we also retain a product by product option to co fund certain later stage development activities  thereby potentially increasing our royalties and affording us co promotion rights in north america 
in the event we exercise our co promotion rights under either collaboration agreement  we are entitled to receive reimbursement for certain sales force costs we incur in support of our commercial activities 
research and development we incur research and development expenses associated with both partnered and unpartnered research activities  as well as the development and expansion of our drug discovery technologies 
research and development expenses related to our strategic alliance with gsk consisted primarily of costs related to research and screening  lead optimization and other activities relating to the identification of compounds for development as mitotic kinesin inhibitors for the treatment of cancer 
prior to june  certain of these costs were reimbursed by gsk on an fte basis 
from through november  gsk has funded the majority of the costs related to the clinical development of ispinesib and sb under our november amendment to the collaboration and license 
table of contents agreement with gsk  we have assumed responsibility for the continued research  development and commercialization of inhibitors of ksp  including ispinesib and sb  and other mitotic kinesins  at our sole expense subject to gsk s option to resume responsibility for the development and commercialization of either or both of ispinesib and sb during a defined period 
we also have the option to co fund certain later stage development activities for gsk this commitment and the potential exercise of our co funding option will result in a significant increase research and development expenses 
we expect to incur research and development expenses in the continued conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials for ck and other of our cardiac myosin activator compounds for the treatment of heart failure and in connection with our early research programs in other diseases  as well as the continued refinement of our puma tm system and development of our cytometrix technologies and our other existing and future drug discovery technologies 
research and development expenses related to any development and commercialization activities we elect to fund would consist primarily of employee compensation  supplies and materials  costs for consultants and contract research  facilities costs and depreciation of equipment 
from our inception through december   we incurred costs of approximately million for research and development activities relating to the discovery of mitotic kinesin inhibitors  million for our cardiac contractility program  million for our proprietary technologies and million for all other programs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and administrative functions  including but not limited to finance  human resources  legal  business and commercial development and strategic planning 
other significant costs include facilities costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services  including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents 
now in our third year as a public company  we anticipate continued increases in general and administrative expenses associated with operating as a publicly traded company  such as increased costs for insurance  investor relations and compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of stock compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  which required the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases based on estimated fair values 
the following table summarizes stock based compensation related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases under sfas no 
r for  including amortization of deferred compensation recognized under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which was allocated as follows in thousands year ended december  research and development general and administrative stock based compensation included in operating expenses as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock based compensation arrangements granted under our stock option plans subsequent to the initial public offering  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
in addition  we continue to amortize deferred stock based compensation recorded prior to adoption of sfas no 
r for stock options granted prior to the initial public offering 
at december   the balance of deferred stock based compensation was million 
we expect the remaining balance of deferred employee stock based compensation of million as of december  to be amortized in future years as follows  assuming no cancellations of the related stock options million in and million in 
table of contents interest and other income and expense interest and other income and expense consist primarily of interest income and interest expense

in january  we recorded an additional million as deferred revenue in connection with our collaboration and option agreement with amgen 
the million represents the difference between the price paid by amgen of per share and the stock price of per share on the last trading day prior to the date of issuance 
this premium was recorded as deferred revenue in january and will be recognized ratably over the maximum term of the non exclusive license granted to amgen under the collaboration and option agreement  which is approximately four years

research and development expenses increase years ended december  decrease in millions research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million to million in compared with in  and increased  to million in compared with million in the increase in research and development expenses in over was primarily due to increased outsourcing costs related to the manufacture of clinical supplies and clinical trials for our cardiovascular and oncology programs of million  along with higher laboratory facilities and lab consumables expense of million and personnel costs  including charges for stock based compensation of million 
the overall increase in research and development expenses in over was primarily due to increased consulting and outsourced services  particularly preclinical and clinical services of million  partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense for employees and non employees of  and lab consumables of in  from a program perspective  the increased research and development spending was primarily due to increased spending on our early research programs partially offset by slight decreases in spending on oncology and cardiovascular programs and proprietary technologies

clinical timelines  likelihood of success and total completion costs vary significantly for each drug candidate and are difficult to estimate 
we expect to make determinations as to which research programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each 
table of contents drug candidate 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals and subsequent compliance with applicable regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

these costs were incurred commencing when the equipment became available for use in the second quarter of through the expiration date of the agreement  december  our payments to portola for such equipment costs  totaling  are scheduled to be made in eight quarterly installments commencing in the first quarter of and continuing through the fourth quarter of 
table of contents in future periods  we expect to incur substantial costs as we continue to expand our research programs and related research and development activities 
we also plan to conduct clinical development of ispinesib for breast cancer and sb for non hodgkin s lymphoma 
we expect to incur significant research and development expenses as we advance the research and development of our cardiac myosin activators for the treatment of heart failure  continue human clinical trials of ck in  pursue our other early stage research programs in multiple therapeutic areas  and develop our puma tm system  cytometrix technologies and other proprietary drug discovery technologies 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the initiation  progress  timing  scope and completion of preclinical research  development and clinical trials for our drug candidates and potential drug candidates  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  delays that may be caused by requirements of regulatory agencies  amgen s decisions with regard to funding of development and commercialization of ck or other compounds for the treatment of heart failure under our collaboration  gsk s decisions with regard to future funding of development of our drug candidates  including gsk and  if it exercises its option  either or both of ispinesib and sb  our level of funding for other current or future drug candidates  our level of funding for the development of ispinesib  sb and gsk  the number of drug candidates we pursue  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  our ability to establish  enforce and maintain selected strategic alliances and activities required for commercialization of our potential drugs  our plans or ability to establish sales  marketing or manufacturing capabilities and to achieve market acceptance for potential drugs  expanding and advancing our research programs  hiring of additional employees and consultants  expanding our facilities  the acquisition of technologies  products and other business opportunities that require financial commitments  and our revenues  if any  from successful development of our drug candidates and commercialization of potential drugs 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  future payments from amgen and gsk  interest earned on investments  proceeds from equipment financings and the potential proceeds from the ceff will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next months 
if  at any time  our prospects for internally financing our research and development programs decline  we may decide to reduce research and development expenses by delaying  discontinuing or reducing our funding of development of one or more of our drug candidates or potential drug candidates 
alternatively  we might raise funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that the funding  if needed  will be available on attractive terms  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
similarly  financing obtained through future co development arrangements may require us to forego certain commercial rights to future drug candidates 
our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included in this form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for research performed and milestones met  and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
research and development revenues  which are earned under agreements with third parties for contract research and development activities  may include nonrefundable license fees  research and development funding  cost reimbursements and contingent milestones and royalties 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are evaluated under emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
nonrefundable license fees are recognized as revenue as we perform under the applicable agreement 
where the level of effort is relatively consistent over the performance period  we recognize total fixed or determined revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated period of expected performance 
we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon achievement of the milestone provided the milestone payment is nonrefundable  substantive effort and risk is involved in achieving the milestone and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
if these conditions are not met  we defer the milestone payment and recognize it as revenue over the estimated period of performance under the contract as we complete our performance obligations 
research and development revenues and cost reimbursements are based upon negotiated rates for our ftes and actual out of pocket costs 
fte rates are intended to approximate our anticipated costs 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue 
none of the revenues recognized to date are refundable if the relevant research effort is not successful 
in revenue arrangements in which both parties make payments to each other  we will evaluate the payments in accordance with the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting 
table of contents for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products to determine whether payments made by us will be recognized as a reduction of revenue or as expense 
in accordance with eitf  revenue recognized by us may be reduced by payments made to the other party under the arrangement unless we receive a separate and identifiable benefit in exchange for the payments and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
grant revenues are recorded as research is performed 
grant revenues are not refundable 
preclinincal study and clinical trial accruals a substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials have been performed by third party contract research organizations  or cros  and other vendors 
for preclinical studies  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the percentage of work completed to date and contract milestones achieved 
for clinical trial expenses  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled  duration of enrollment and percentage of work completed to date 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence and status meetings with cros and review of contractual terms 
our estimates are dependent on the timeliness and accuracy of data provided by our cros and other vendors 
if we have incomplete or inaccurate data  we may under or overestimate activity levels associated with various studies or trials at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity levels become known 
no material adjustments to preclinical study and clinical trial expenses have been recognized to date 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which establishes accounting for share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases 
under sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense on a straight line basis over the employee s requisite service period  generally the vesting period of the award 
we elected the modified prospective transition method for awards granted subsequent to april   the date of our initial public offering  and the prospective transition method for awards granted prior to our initial public offering 
prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes under either transition method 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
and related interpretations 
we also followed the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and complied with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods  or services 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  from time to time we will likely change the valuation assumptions we use to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
deferred tax valuation allowance we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the financial statements  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to zero  because we believe that  based 
table of contents upon a number of factors  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
to minimize risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including us government and agency securities  high grade municipal and us corporate bonds  commercial paper  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
our investment portfolio of short term investments is subject to interest rate risk  and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase  consequently  we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to significant interest rate risk and have therefore excluded them from the table below 
on the liability side  our equipment financing lines carry fixed interest rates and therefore also may be subject to changes in fair value if market interest rates fluctuate 
we do not have any foreign currency or derivative financial instruments
