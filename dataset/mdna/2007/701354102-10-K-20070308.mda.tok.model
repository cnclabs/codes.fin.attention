part i item business description of business parkervision  inc the company or we was incorporated under the laws of the state of florida on august  we operate in the business of wireless technologies and products 
we are in the business of designing  developing and marketing our proprietary wireless radio frequency rf technologies for use in semiconductor circuits for wireless radio applications 
our immediate market focus is on securing licensing agreements for our directpower or dp rf transmit chain technology 
our target customers are top tier mobile handset manufacturers and their key semiconductor suppliers 
we believe our proprietary wireless technologies embody significant industry advances that can be commercialized in the near term 
from late through june of  we manufactured and sold branded wireless networking products that incorporated our proprietary technology through retail and internet retail distribution channels 
all of our revenues from continuing operations to date were generated from these retail products 
in june  we exited our manufacturing and retail sales activities in pursuit of our longer term business strategy of establishing relationships with original equipment manufacturers oems for the incorporation of our technology into their products 
our decision to exit the retail activities was precipitated by advances in our wireless technology resulting in increased interest from oem prospects  specifically in the mobile handset market 
we determined that the investment required to increase brand awareness  introduce new product offerings  and expand the distribution channel for retail products  would detract from our ability to capitalize on oem opportunities 
exiting the retail business resulted in charges to our second quarter operating results of approximately million 
during the second half of  we sold our remaining finished product inventories  including those products reclaimed from retail and distribution channel partners  to a wholesaler 
we also entered into a consignment arrangement for the liquidation of our remaining raw materials inventory and liquidated our manufacturing and prototype facility assets and other property and equipment utilized in retail business activities 
as of december   we had substantially completed our retail exit activities 
in parallel with our retail exit activities in the second half of  we began demonstrating our dp wireless technology to prospective oem customers in the mobile handset industry using semi integrated circuits 
at the end of  we completed our first dp integrated circuit ic which allowed us to demonstrate the advantages of our technology and its manufacturability in silicon 
throughout  we continued to further integrate our technology in silicon while cultivating potential customer relationships 
our sales related activities in included prototype demonstrations of our increasingly integrated dp platform  support of in depth technical due diligence by prospective customers  analysis of prospective customer product plans  delivery of initial proposals and terms  and  ultimately  negotiations of proposed business relationships 
in addition  early in  we expanded our target customer base to include not only the top tier mobile handset oem providers but also their key component suppliers 
in the second half of  we also initiated a campaign targeted at the wireless network providers who are key influencers to the oems in the mobile handset industry 
we are also exploring potential business arrangements with one or more target customers outside the mobile handset industry who may have applications for our technology that are in concert with our development efforts in the mobile handset space 
our current business strategy is to become a provider of intellectual property through licensing arrangements which will enable others to design and manufacture ics incorporating our proprietary wireless technology 
based on the current status of business negotiations  we believe our first licensing arrangements will be realized in the near term 
to date  we have generated no revenue from licensing of our wireless rf transmit technologies 
our ability to generate revenues sufficient to offset costs is subject to our ability to successfully market our intellectual property for design into widely deployed products that are manufactured by others 
we believe our technology has substantial advantages over competing technologies  especially in the third generation  or g  mobile handset market and generations that are likely to evolve beyond g  such as g and g mobile handset standards and applications 
our unique technology processes the rf waveform in a more optimal manner than existing technologies  thereby allowing oems to create handsets that have extended battery life  more easily incorporate multiple air interface standards and frequencies in smaller form factors  and reduce manufacturing costs 
our technology provides such attractive benefits  in part  because its unique integrated circuit architecture enables efficient digital circuit processing  eliminating many of the limitations of legacy analog processing 
in addition  our technology has proven to be attractive to the network providers as it can increase capacity  coverage and data throughput of their mobile networks 
recent developments sale of equity securities to fund continuing operations on february   we completed the sale of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to a limited number of domestic institutional and other investors in a private placement transaction pursuant to offering exemptions under the securities act of the shares  which represent of our outstanding common stock on an after issued basis  were sold at a price of per share  for net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds from this transaction will be used for general working capital purposes 
we will register the common stock issued in the private offering for re offer and re sale by the investors 
we have committed to file the registration statement within days of closing and to cause the registration statement to become effective on or prior to the earlier of i the fifth trading day following the date that we are notified by the sec that the registration statement will not be reviewed or is no longer subject to review  and ii days after the closing date 
if the common stock is not registered for resale within those time periods  we will pay liquidated damages in the amount of one percent of the amount invested for each day period pro rated until the filing or effectiveness of the registration statement  up to a maximum of ten percent of the gross proceeds 
technology and products our wireless technologies  collectively referred to as energy signal processing or esp  represent unique  proprietary methods for processing rf waveforms in wireless applications 
the technology applies to the transmit baseband data to an rf carrier signal and receive rf carrier signal to baseband data functions of a radio transceiver 
the transmit portion of the technology is called directpower  or dp  and enables the transformation of a digital baseband signal to an rf carrier waveform  at the desired power output level  in a single unified operation 
the receiver portion of the technology is called directdata  or dd  and enables the direct conversion of an rf carrier to baseband data signal 
we are currently focused solely on commercialization of our dp technology solutions 
we have completed several engineering prototypes of our dp based ics targeted at mobile handset applications 
these ics were produced using a silicon germanium sige process through a fabrication relationship with ibm microelectronics ibm 
these ics are utilized to verify that our technology can be highly integrated in silicon and to demonstrate the benefits of the technology to oem target customers 
the portion of the ic that embodies the core rf technology is not customer specific and therefore has been highly integrated in prototype ics 
we anticipate that oem customers will engage us to customize the implementation of the core technology based on their specific interface and product requirements 
our current prototypes support multi band meaning multiple frequencies and multi mode meaning multiple cellular standards and corresponding modulation formats functionality 
our ics support multiple bands of cellular and pcs frequencies and support the current and emerging cellular standards including gsm edge  cdma  w cdma  and hsupa 
we are also able to demonstrate e wimax standards using pcs frequencies with our current ics 
our dd receiver technology was first introduced in the form of transceiver ics for the wireless local area networking wlan market in in  we began marketing ics to oems and original design manufacturers odm s who manufacture and sell wlan products or application modules that incorporate wlan capabilities 
we found that the unique nature of the technology and related design requirements  the features that oems were interested in for volume wlan applications  and the lack of brand recognition in the marketplace hindered our marketing efforts 
as a result  in  we initiated a business strategy of developing our own dd based wlan products for marketing to end users 
we believe this strategy would not only generate initial product revenue but would also provide a proof of concept to oems and odms of the underlying technology 
in addition  we believed the development of finished products enabled better understanding of the manufacturing requirements  design interface needs and other requirements which allows refinement of designs in subsequent generations of ics 
in the fourth quarter of  we introduced our first dd based wlan end user products for wireless internet data networking applications 
these products included a wireless local area networking card  designed for use with laptop computers  a wireless universal serial bus adaptor for use with desktop computers and a wireless four port router for networking applications 
all of our initial products were compliant with the b industry standard for wlan communications 
during and early  we produced wlan products for retail distribution and our product development efforts focused on expanding the retail offering to the g standard as well as to cordless telephones utilizing the dd technology 
in june  we ceased production and development efforts for our wlan end user products and exited our retail business activities in order to focus exclusively on oem opportunities  particularly with regard to our transmit technology implementation which we believe has broad adoption potential in the mobile handset market 
we anticipate that our receiver technology will also be ultimately adopted in the mobile handset market  however we estimate its adoption will lag behind the adoption of our transmit technology by at least twelve to eighteen months 
marketing and sales our marketing and sales activities are currently focused on top tier oems that design and or manufacture mobile handsets  and the key semiconductor suppliers to those oems 
we are engaged in discussions with companies that  based on industry data  collectively represent over of the handset shipments worldwide 
we are also exploring potential business arrangements with one or more target customers outside the mobile handset industry to the extent their applications for our technology are complimentary to our efforts in the mobile handset market 
our sales and sales support activities include prototype demonstrations of both semi integrated and highly integrated circuits that showcase the benefits of the technology  support of detailed technology due diligence discussions and testing  analysis of potential customer product roadmaps and integration alternatives  and negotiations of specific terms of potential business relationships 
we believe the sales cycle  from the initial customer meeting to the consummation of a business arrangement  is approximately months 
the length of the sales cycle is a result of many factors  including the unique nature of our technology  intense technology evaluation and due diligence required based on the complex nature of radio frequency technology  in general  and the cellular specifications  in particular  our lack of tenure in the cellular industry  and the variety of licensing implementations and integration decisions that must be evaluated by the customer in order to assess the specific value proposition for their needs 
we believe our initial design wins will occur in the near term and furthermore  we believe our sales cycle with additional customers will shorten significantly following initial adoption 
future sales cycles may be influenced by the terms of our initial customers and our ability to expand internal resources to support multiple customers 
prior to june  we promoted and sold our wlan end user products in the united states and canada through traditional retailers  online retailers  value added resellers vars and direct through our own online store 
in june  we exited our retail business activities to pursue oem opportunities 
the retail exit included a reduction in retail sales and marketing staff and cessation of all retail marketing activities 
we continued to work with our retail and distribution partners throughout the balance of to facilitate returns of unsold product in the channel 
we sold our remaining retail product inventory to a wholesaler and anticipate no further revenue from retail product sales 
competition we operate in a highly competitive industry against companies with substantially greater financial  technical  and sales and marketing resources 
our transmit technology  which is currently being marketed to mobile handset oems  faces competition from incumbent providers of transmitters and power amplifiers including companies such as rf microdevices  anadigics  skyworks  texas instruments  freescale  philips  and others 
each of our competitors  however  also has the potential of becoming a licensee of our technology 
we also compete against rf engineering programs within the research and development organizations of our target customers 
to date  we are unaware of any competing or emerging rf technologies that provide all the simultaneous benefits that our technology enables 
we believe we can gain oem adoption  and therefore compete  based on the performance and cost advantages enabled by our unique circuit architecture  as supported by a solid and defensible intellectual property portfolio 
our intellectual property offering is capable of being compliant with mobile standards based g requirements and can accept the same baseband data input as traditional or future offerings 
in addition  we believe the improved power efficiencies enabled by our technology provide a solution to an existing problem in applications for g standards and beyond that the oems and wireless carriers alike are seeking to solve 
production and supply our current business strategy is focused on licensing our intellectual property  not supply of ics 
as a result  the production capacity risk shifts to the oem and its key semiconductor suppliers 
we currently have a fabrication relationship with ibm for the production of our dp based prototype ics on a sige process 
we believe ibm has sufficient capacity to meet our foreseeable needs 
in addition  our ics can be produced using different materials and processes  if necessary  to satisfy capacity requirements and or customer preferences 
discontinued operations in may  we completed the sale of certain designated assets of our video division to thomson broadcast media solutions  inc and thomson licensing  sa collectively referred to as thomson 
the assets sold included the pvtv and cameraman products  services  patents  patent applications  trademarks  tradenames and other intellectual property  inventory  specified design  development and manufacturing equipment  and obligations under outstanding contracts for products and services and other assets 
the sales price of the assets was approximately million 
we recognized a gain on the sale of discontinued operations in of approximately million which is net of losses on the disposal of remaining assets related to the video operations of approximately million 
we agreed not to compete with the business of the video division for five years after the closing date 
we also agreed not to seek legal recourse against thomson in respect of our intellectual property that was transferred or should have been transferred if used in connection with the video operations 
additionally  we indemnified thomson against intellectual property claims for an unlimited period of time  without any minimum threshold  and with a separate maximum of  the operations of our video business unit were classified as discontinued operations when the operations and cash flows of the business unit were eliminated from ongoing operations 
the prior years operating activities for the video business unit have also been reclassified to gain from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
patents and trademarks we consider our intellectual property  including patents  patent applications and trademarks  to be significant to our competitive positioning 
we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents  copyrights  and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products 
as of december   we have obtained us and foreign patents related to our esp technologies and have patent applications pending in the united states and other countries 
in addition  in february  we were granted our first united states patent specifically related to our dp transmit technology 
we estimate the economic lives of our patents to be fifteen to twenty years 
research and development for the years ended december   and  we spent approximately million  million  and million  respectively  on research and development for continuing operations 
our research and development efforts have been devoted to the development of rf technologies and related products 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  of which are employed in engineering research and development and product operations  in sales and marketing  and in executive management  finance and administration 
our employees are not represented by a labor union 
we consider our employee relations satisfactory

item a 
risk factors in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business  operating results  liquidity and financial condition 
as a result of the risk factors set forth below  actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
we have had a history of losses which may ultimately compromise our ability to implement our business plan and continue in operations 
we have had losses in each year since our inception in  and continue to have an accumulated deficit which  at december   was million 
the net loss for was million 
to date  our technologies and products have not produced revenues sufficient to cover operating  research and development and overhead costs 
we also will continue to make expenditures on marketing  research and development  pursuit of patent protection for our intellectual property and operational costs for fulfillment of any contracts that we achieve for the sale of our products or technologies 
we expect that our revenues in the near term will not bring the company to profitability 
if we are not able to generate sufficient revenues or we have insufficient capital resources  we will not be able to implement our business plan and investors will suffer a loss in their investment 
this may result in a change in our business strategies 
we expect to need additional capital in the future  which if we are unable to raise will result in our not being able to implement our business plan as currently formulated 
because we have had net losses and  to date  have not generated positive cash flow from operations  we have funded our operating losses from the sale of equity securities from time to time and the sale of our video division in we anticipate that our business plan will continue to require significant expenditures for research and development  patent protection  sales and marketing and general operations 
our current capital resources  including cash and short term investments of million and net proceeds from our february private placement transaction of approximately million  are expected to sustain operations through the first quarter of  if not longer 
thereafter  unless we increase revenues to a level that they cover operating expenses or we reduce costs  we will require additional capital to fund these expenses 
financing  if any  may be in the form of loans or additional sales of equity securities 
a loan or the sale of preferred stock may result in the imposition of operational limitations and other covenants and payment obligations  any of which may be burdensome to us 
the sale of equity securities will result in dilution to the current stockholders ownership 
the long term continuation of our business plan is dependent upon the generation of sufficient revenues from the sale of our products  additional funding or reducing expenses or a combination of the foregoing 
the failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise capital or reduce expenses could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our long term business objectives 
our industry is subject to rapid technological changes which if we are unable to match or surpass  will result in a loss of competitive advantage and market opportunity 
because of the rapid technological development that regularly occurs in the microelectronics industry  we must continually devote substantial resources to developing and improving our technology and introducing new product offerings 
for example  in fiscal years and  we spent approximately and million  respectively  on research and development  and we expect to continue to spend a significant amount in this area in the future 
these efforts and expenditures are necessary to establish and increase market share and  ultimately  to grow revenues 
if another company offers better products or our product development lags  a competitive position or market window opportunity may be lost  and therefore our revenues or revenue potential may be adversely affected 
if our products are not commercially accepted  our developmental investment will be lost and our future business continuation will be impaired 
there can be no assurance that our research and development will produce commercially viable technologies and products 
if existing or new technologies and products are not commercially accepted  the funds expended will not be recoverable  and our competitive and financial position will be adversely affected 
in addition  perception of our business prospects will be impaired with an adverse impact on our ability to do business and to attract capital and employees 
if our patents and intellectual property do not provide us with the anticipated market protections and competitive position  our business and prospects will be impaired 
we rely on our intellectual property  including patents and patent applications  to provide competitive advantage and protect us from theft of our intellectual property 
we believe that many of our patents are for entirely new technologies 
if the patents are not issued or issued patents are later shown not to be as broad as currently believed  or are otherwise challenged such that some or all of the protection is lost  we will suffer adverse effects from the loss of competitive advantage and our ability to offer unique products and technologies 
in addition  there would be an adverse impact on our financial condition and business prospects 
if we cannot demonstrate that our technologies and products can compete in the marketplace and are better than current competitive solutions  then we will not be able to generate the sales we need to continue our business and our prospects will be impaired 
we expect to face competition from chip suppliers such as rf microdevices  anadigics  skyworks  texas instruments and philips  among others 
our technology may also face competition from other emerging approaches or new technological advances which are under development and have not yet emerged 
if our technologies and products are not established in the market place as improvements over current  traditional chip solutions in wireless communications  our business prospects and financial condition will be adversely affected 
we believe that we will rely  in large part  on key business and sales relationships for the successful commercialization of our products  which if not developed or maintained  will have an adverse impact on achieving market awareness and acceptance and will result in a loss of business opportunity 
to achieve a wide market awareness and acceptance of our products  as part of our business strategy  we will attempt to enter into a variety of business relationships with other companies which will incorporate our intellectual property into their products and or market products based on our technologies 
our successful commercialization of our products will depend in part on our ability to meet obligations under contracts with respect to the products and related development requirements 
the failure of the business relationships will limit the commercialization of our products which will have an adverse impact on our business development and our ability to generate revenues and recover development expenses 
we are highly dependent on mr 
jeffrey parker as our chief executive officer whose services  if lost  would have an adverse impact on our leadership  industry perception  and investor perception about our future 
because of mr 
parker s position in the company and the respect he has garnered in both the industry in which we operate and the investment community  the loss of the services of mr 
parker might be seen as an impediment to the execution of our business plan 
if mr 
parker were no longer available to the company  investors may experience an adverse impact on their investment 
we do not currently have an employment agreement with mr 
parker 
we maintain key employee life insurance for our benefit on mr 
parker 
if we are unable to attract highly skilled employees we will not be able to execute our research and development plans or provide the highly technical services that our products require 
our business is very specialized  and therefore it is dependent on having skilled and specialized employees to conduct our research and development activities  operations  marketing and support 
the inability to obtain these kinds of persons will have an adverse impact on our business development because persons will not obtain the information or services expected in the markets and may prevent us from successfully implementing our current business plans 
the outstanding options and warrants may affect the market price and liquidity of the common stock 
at december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding and had  exercisable options and warrants for the purchase of shares of common stock  assuming no terminations or forfeitures of such options and warrants 
on december  and  there will be  and  respectively  currently outstanding and exercisable options and warrants assuming no new grants  terminations or forfeitures 
all of the underlying common stock of these securities is or will be registered for sale to the holder or for public resale by the holder 
the amount of common stock available for the sales may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise capital and may affect the price and liquidity of the common stock in the public market 
in addition  the issuance of these shares of common stock will have a dilutive effect on current stockholders ownership 
provisions in the certificate of incorporation and by laws could have effects that conflict with the interest of stockholders 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control 
for example  the board of directors has the ability to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  and there are pre notification provisions for director nominations and submissions of proposals from stockholders to a vote by all the stockholders under the by laws 
florida law also has anti takeover provisions in its corporate statute 
we have a shareholder protection rights plan that may delay or discourage someone from making an offer to purchase the company without prior consultation with the board of directors and management which may conflict with the interests of some of the stockholders 
on november   the board of directors adopted a shareholder protection rights plan which called for the issuance  on november   as a dividend  rights to acquire fractional shares of preferred stock 
the rights are attached to the shares of common stock and transfer with them 
in the future the rights may become exchangeable for shares of preferred stock with various provisions that may discourage a takeover bid 
additionally  the rights have what are known as flip in and flip over provisions that could make any acquisition of the company more costly 
the principal objective of the plan is to cause someone interested in acquiring the company to negotiate with the board of directors rather than launch an unsolicited bid 
this plan may limit  prevent  or discourage a takeover offer that some stockholders may find more advantageous than a negotiated transaction 
a negotiated transaction may not be in the best interests of the stockholders

our immediate market focus is on securing licensing agreements for our dp rf transmit chain technology 
our primary target customers are top tier mobile handset manufacturers and their key semiconductor suppliers 
we believe our proprietary wireless technologies embody significant industry advances that can be commercialized in the near term 
we have made significant investments in developing our technologies and products  the returns on which are dependent upon the generation of future revenues for realization 
we have not yet generated revenues sufficient to offset our operating expenses and have used the proceeds from the sale of equity securities to fund our operations 
in june  we exited our retail business activities which represented our sole source of revenue from continuing operations 
we expect to consummate initial license agreements in early for the design of our technology into mobile handsets 
we intend to continue to use our working capital to support future marketing  sales  research and development and general operations 
no assurance can be given that such expenditures will result in revenues  new products  or technological advances or that we have adequate capital to complete our products or gain market acceptance before requiring additional capital 
critical accounting policies we believe that the following are the critical accounting policies affecting the preparation of our consolidated financial statements use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the more significant estimates made by management include the volatility  risk free interest rate  forfeiture rate and estimate lives of share based awards used in the calculation of the fair market value of share based compensation  the assessment of impairment of assets and amortization period for intangible and long lived assets  and the valuation allowance for deferred taxes 
actual results could differ from the estimates made 
management periodically evaluates estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for continued reasonableness 
appropriate adjustments  if any  to the estimates used are made prospectively based upon such periodic evaluation 
accounting for stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  fas r which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services 
under the provisions of fas r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense on a straight line basis over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to fas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of fas r 
prior to january   we accounted for share based compensation to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
we also followed the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method as provided by fas r and  accordingly  financial statement amounts for the prior periods have not been retroactively adjusted to reflect the fair value method of expensing share based compensation 
under the modified prospective method  share based expense recognized after adoption includes a share based expense for all awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas and b share based expense for all awards granted or modified subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
further  as required under fasr  we estimate forfeitures for options granted which are not expected to vest 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our stock based compensation expense 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas no 
r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards  fsp fas r 
fsp fas r provides a practical exception when a company transitions to the accounting requirements in fasr 
fasr requires a company to calculate the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to adopting fasr termed the apic pool  assuming the company had been following the recognition provisions prescribed by sfas no 
we have elected to use the shortcut method under fap fas r to calculate our apic pool 
impairment of long lived assets property and equipment  patents  copyrights and other intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated period of benefit  ranging from three to twenty years 
management evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets periodically and takes into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate impairment exists 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas

results of operations for each of the years ended december   and exit from retail business activities in june  we announced our plan to exit our retail business activities and continue our pursuit of an oem business strategy for commercialization of our proprietary wireless technologies 
our decision to exit the retail activities was precipitated by advances in our wireless technology that generated increased interest from oem prospects  especially in the mobile handset market 
management determined that the investment required to increase brand awareness  expand product offerings  and expand the distribution channel for retail products would detract from our ability to capitalize on oem opportunities 
exiting the retail business resulted in charges to our second quarter operating results totaling approximately million  primarily related to employee severance benefits and the reduction of assets to their expected recovery value 
during the second half of  we reclaimed unsold product inventory from the distribution channel  liquidated our raw materials and finished product inventories through wholesale channels and liquidated our manufacturing and prototype facility assets and other property and equipment utilized in the retail business activities 
we substantially completed our retail exit activities by the end of revenues we had no revenues for the year ended december  revenues for the years ended december  and included retail product revenue of  and  respectively 
in addition  revenues for the year ended december  included royalty revenue of  from a one time previously deferred royalty payment upon termination of a licensing agreement 
prior period product revenues represent sales of wireless consumer product through retail channels 
the increase in product revenue of  from to was primarily a result of the expansion of our retail distribution channel starting in the third quarter of at the time of our exit from retail business activities we had products in approximately retail storefronts 
although we exited our retail business activities in june  product revenues from the retail channel continued through the second half of as retailers continued to sell through discontinued products and we recognized previously deferred revenue based on expiration of retailers rights to return products 
at december   we had deferred revenue from product sales in the distribution channel of  revenues for the period ended december  and were net of an allowance recovery for sales returns of  and  respectively 
in addition to the reserve for sales returns  gross revenue was reduced for price protection programs  customer rebates and cooperative marketing costs deemed to be sales incentives under emerging issues task force  eitf issue  to derive net revenue 
for the years ended december  and  net revenue was reduced for cooperative marketing costs in the amount of  and  respectively 
our generation of future revenues is dependent upon our ability to successfully consummate relationships with oems for integration of our technology into widely deployed products that are manufactured by others 
to date  we do not have any oem contracts for our technology 
we anticipate consummating initial licensing agreements for our technology in the near term 
we expect that revenues from these agreements will include up front technology access fees  non recurring engineering fees for design support services  and ultimately royalty revenues on a per unit sold basis 
based on the design cycle in the mobile handset market  we anticipate that royalty revenues will not be recognized within the first twelve months following the initial customer agreement 
as such  we do not anticipate that revenues in will be sufficient to offset our operating expenses 
gross margin the gross margins for products and royalties for the years ended december  and were as follows products royalties total our product margin in reflects a write down of inventory to net realizable value in the amount of  this write down was a result of our exit from retail activities in the second quarter of  resulting in a mark down of remaining product inventory to estimated wholesale values 
our product margin in reflects a write down of inventory to net realizable value in the amount of  this write down was triggered by a significant price decrease on our wireless networking product line in the fourth quarter of  along with the high carrying costs of initial production inventory 
the margin recognized on royalty revenues in was due to the recognition of a one time  previously deferred prepaid royalty in connection with the termination of a licensing agreement 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses decreased by  or  from  in to  in our research and development expenses decreased by  or  from  in to  in the decrease in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to cost reductions following the june retail exit including a reduction in retail product development personnel and related costs of approximately  and a reduction in depreciation and amortization of retail related assets of approximately  these decreases were offset by increases in expenses for the use of outside design firms of approximately  increases in employee stock compensation expense due the adoption of fasr of approximately  and increases in prototype costs of approximately  stemming from increases in the number of prototype chip production runs 
the decrease in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to the reduction of personnel and third party development fees of approximately  a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately  and a reduction in outside prototype costs  including foundry costs  of approximately  these reductions were somewhat offset by increases in maintenance costs for software development tools of approximately  increases in professional fees related to patents of approximately  and an increase in overhead and other costs related to utilizing our manufacturing facility in the first half of for prototypes of approximately  the decreases in personnel  third party development fees  amortization expense and prototype expenses resulted from our exit from retail activities in june the decreases in foundry costs are  in part  due to utilization of shared foundry services as opposed to dedicated foundry runs which cost three to four times more per run 
the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
our ability to successfully develop and introduce  on a timely basis  new and enhanced products and technologies will be a significant factor in our ability to grow and remain competitive 
although the percentage of revenues invested in our research and development programs may vary from period to period  we are committed to continue investing in our technology development 
we anticipate that we will use a substantial portion of our working capital for research and development activities in we anticipate that the consummation of initial customer relationships in may result in increased development expenses  however  we believe that some or all of such increases may be offset by non recurring engineering fees paid to us by customers

our ability to generate revenues will largely depend upon the rate at which we are able to secure oem adoption of our technology and products 
the expected revenues for will not be sufficient to cover our operational expenses for the expected continued losses and use of cash will continue to be funded from available working capital 
on february   we completed the sale of  shares of common stock in a private placement transaction for net proceeds of approximately million

in the event that we do not generate sufficient revenues  we will be required to obtain additional funding through public or private financing and or reduce certain discretionary spending 
management believes certain operating costs could be reduced if working capital decreases significantly and additional funding is not available 
in addition  we currently have no outstanding long term debt obligations 
failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise additional capital and or reduce certain discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended long term business objectives
