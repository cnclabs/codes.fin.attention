at october   approximately of the investments were directly invested in mutual funds and were managed by professional money managers 
remaining investments are in managed partnerships that use various strategies to minimize their correlation to stock market movements 
most of the investments are highly liquid and the company believes they represent a responsible approach to cash management 
in the company s opinion  the greatest investment risk is the potential for negative market impact from unexpected  major adverse news 
existing working capital and anticipated cash flow are expected to be sufficient to fund operations and capital requirements for at least the next months 
at october   the company had no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements except for the hedging line of credit discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
because earnings are anticipated to be reinvested in operations  cash dividends are not expected to be paid 
the company has no defined benefit plans and no obligations for post retirement employee benefits

ebitda is not a gaap measure of operating performance 
the company uses this non gaap performance measure primarily to compare its performance with other companies in the industry that make a similar disclosure 
the company believes that this performance measure may also be useful to investors for the same purpose 
investors should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for operating income  or any other measure for determining the company s operating performance that is calculated in accordance with gaap 
in addition  because ebitda is not a gaap measure  it may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies

although product prices are key to the company s ability to operate profitably and to budget capital expenditures  they are beyond the company s control and are difficult to predict 
since  the company has periodically hedged the price of a portion of its estimated natural gas production when the potential for significant downward price movement is anticipated 
hedging transactions typically take the form of forward short positions and collars on the nymex futures market  and are closed by purchasing offsetting positions 
such hedges  which are accounted for as cash flow hedges  do not exceed estimated production volumes  are expected to have reasonable correlation between price movements in the futures market and the cash markets where the company s production is located  and are authorized by the company s board of directors 
hedges are expected to be closed as related production occurs but may be closed earlier if the anticipated downward price movement occurs or if the company believes that the potential for such movement has abated 
the company recognizes all derivatives consisting solely of cash flow hedges on its balance sheet at fair value at the end of each period 
changes in the fair value of a cash flow hedge are recorded in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets and then are reclassified into the consolidated statement of operations as the underlying hedged item affects earnings 
amounts reclassified into earnings related to natural gas hedges are included in oil and gas sales 
hedging gains and losses are recognized as adjustments to gas sales as the hedged product is produced

most oil and condensate volumes are associated with natural gas production and  therefore  vary from well to well depending on the volume and richness of the natural gas produced 
significant properties see definition on page contributed of production on a gas equivalent basis 
increases in natural gas volumes resulted primarily from successful drilling in oklahoma 
oil and gas activities capital spending 
capital spending in totaled  operations during fiscal  the company s operations were focused on its two core projects natural gas drilling and application of its patented calliope gas recovery system 
as discussed below  the company has expanded into south texas through an exploration program using d seismic to define the vicksburg  frio  queen city and wilcox prospects in hidalgo and jim hogg counties 
the company has also expanded into north central kansas through an exploration program using d seismic to define lansing kansas city oil prospects along the central kansas uplift 
also as discussed below  the company has expanded its calliope operations into texas and louisiana 
the company believes these are fertile areas for calliope and will continue to expand as opportunities allow 
during  the company plans to commence drilling operations on a new project to drill wells into existing reservoirs for the specific purpose of using calliope to recover stranded gas 
the company believes that  in combination  its drilling and calliope projects provide an excellent and possibly unique balance for achieving its goal of adding long lived natural gas reserves and production at reasonable costs and risks 
however  it should be expected that successful results will occur unevenly for both the drilling and calliope projects 
drilling results are dependent on both the timing of drilling and on the drilling success rate 
calliope results are primarily dependent on the timing  volume and quality of calliope installations available to the company 
the company will continue to actively pursue adding reserves through its two core projects in fiscal  and expects these activities to be a reliable source of reserve additions 
however  the timing and extent of such activities can be dependent on many factors which are beyond the company s control  including but not limited to  the availability of oil field services such as drilling rigs  production equipment and related services  and access to wells for application of the company s patented gas recovery system on low pressure gas wells 
the prevailing price of oil and natural gas has a significant effect on demand and  thus  the related cost of such services and wells 
the company is currently experiencing delays in securing drilling rigs and delivery of production equipment  primarily compressors and coil tubing 
these delays are extending the time it takes the company to conduct its field operations 
as a result  the company could be at risk for price increases related to these types of services and equipment 
drilling activities 
northern anadarko basin the company drills primarily on its significant inventory of acreage approximately  gross acres located along the northern portion of the anadarko basin where it has drilled approximately wells 
the wells target the morrow  oswego and chester formations between  and  feet 
the company expects to drill a substantial number of additional wells on this acreage 
subsequent to fiscal year end  the company participated in a  gross acre prospect located in the texas panhandle 
an  foot well was drilled in december that encountered over pressured upper morrow sands 
production casing has been set  and the well is awaiting completion for pipeline sales 
the well is classified as a tight hole  meaning that information is not being released for proprietary business reasons 
the company owns a working interest 
for the year ended october   the company drilled wells on its northern anadarko basin acreage of which seven were completed at producers 
however  drilling is not restricted to the northern anadarko basin 
the company is generating prospects elsewhere in the oklahoma panhandle  north central oklahoma  north central kansas  and south texas and east texas 
during fiscal  five wells were drilled on the company s  gross acre glacier prospect located in harper and woodward counties  oklahoma 
two of the wells are producers  two are dry holes  and one well is currently being tested and appears to be a marginal producer 
the most important of these wells are the garnet state and scarlet state 
both wells encountered excellent morrow sands at about  feet  and are producing at high rates for the area 
the two wells initially produced at a combined rate of almost mmcfe million cubic of gas equivalent per day 
previously  the company drilled two other high rate wells on the glacier prospect  both of which had limited reservoir extent but proved the presence of high quality sands on the prospect 
the company owns a working interest in the garnet state and a interest in the scarlet state  and is the operator of both wells and the prospect 
drilling is also continuing on the company s  gross acre buffalo creek prospect 
during the company completed the  foot lauer well as the third oil well on the prospect at initial rates over bo barrels of oil per day 
a d seismic program is currently being conducted to identify additional drilling locations 
the company owns a working interest and is the operator 
a second well was drilled on the company s  gross acre saddle prospect and was completed in the morrow formation producing about mcf per day 
additional wells are scheduled for the prospect 
the company owns a working interest and is the operator 
drilling program expansion and diversification last year  the company significantly expanded both the volume and breadth of its exploration program with new projects in south texas and north central kansas 
it is the company s intention to diversify its exploration geographically  scientifically  and in terms of capital  risk and reserve potential 
compared to drilling in oklahoma  the south texas project involves significantly higher costs and greater risks but significantly higher per well reserve potential 
the north central kansas project is geared to oil exploration and has excellent potential to add significant reserves at moderate costs and risks 
both projects are in areas where d seismic is a proven exploration tool and where continuing refinements are providing excellent exploration success 
equally as important  both exploration teams specialize in their respective geographic areas and have been highly successful finding new reserves using d seismic 
south texas last year  the company commenced a new exploration project in south texas 
the project is d seismic driven and focuses on the vicksburg  frio  queen city and wilcox sands in hidalgo and jim hogg counties ranging in depth from  to  feet 
both the cost and the potential of this project far exceed anything the company had experienced before 
in return for a interest before investment payout calculated on a prospect by prospect basis and interest after investment payout  the company initially committed  for prospect generation and leasing costs 
the commitment has been fully funded and all future project funding is at the company s discretion 
the company has the option to participate in drilling each prospect for all  or a portion  of its interest 
if the company does not participate for its full interest  the remaining portion will be sold to industry participants on a promoted basis 
the exploration team has generated a significant number of high quality d seismic drilling prospects  and will generate more prospects in the future 
leasing is complete on six prospects  one of which has been drilled 
fully leased prospects include the gross acre esparza prospect which targets marks sands at approximately  feet  the  gross acre sam houston prospect which targets frio sands at approximately  feet  the  gross acre west mestena prospect which targets queen city sands at approximately  feet  the  gross acre millennium prospect which targets wilcox sands at approximately  and the gross acre vela prospect which targets frio sands at approximately  feet 
the company participated for its full interest in the first project well which was drilled on the  gross acre robertson prospect in hidalgo county 
production casing has been set on the  foot well  and upper frio sands have been tested at rates of approximately mmcfe per day 
however  pressure data indicates that the reservoir may be limited in size 
an additional up hole sand appears on logs to be productive and may be evaluated before a final commercial production decision is made 
the ths cost of the well is expected to range between  and  in response to drilling costs which have almost doubled since the project began  the company recently elected to reduce its exposure to drilling participation in the next four prospects by selling all  or a significant portion  of its interest to industry drilling participants 
the company expects to recover its investment in each prospect and retain a promoted interest in exploratory wells with the option to participate in development drilling 
because the project has significant potential to increase production and reserves  the company has reserved the option to participate for its full interest in all other prospects 
this strategy will reduce the company s south texas exploration risk and improve its staying power 
north central kansas during and  the company diversified its exploration by acquiring interests in three different drilling projects encompassing about  gross acres located on the central kansas uplift 
the acreage is located in a prolific producing area of the central kansas uplift where d seismic has recently proven to be an effective exploration tool 
the project provides diversification to the company s drilling program  both geographically and scientifically  through the use of d seismic 
it also exclusively targets oil reserves which will help bring better product balance to the company s reserve base 
the company owns interests in the projects ranging from to 
drilling targets the lansing kansas city formation at  feet 
completed costs for individual wells are averaging approximately the largest of the three drilling projects is approximately  gross acres located in graham and sheridan counties  kansas 
the company owns a interest and committed to shoot seismic and participate in drilling five test wells 
the commitment has been fully funded and all future project funding is at the company s discretion 
approximately square miles of d seismic have been shot and evaluated  and six exploratory wells have been drilled  of which one well is an excellent producer and five wells are dry holes 
the new producer is making bo per day after two months of production 
it is located on a prospect containing approximately  gross acres 
additional development drilling is scheduled for the prospect 
the project is in an early stage and the learning curve is steep 
seismic data is currently being reprocessed and re evaluated to incorporate data obtained from drilling the initial wells 
the company believes drilling results will improve as it gains additional experience in the area 
drilling is expected on approximately prospects 
calliope drilling project see discussion under calliope gas recovery technology below 
all of the company s oil and natural gas properties are located on shore in the continental united states 
the company s future drilling activities may not be successful  and its overall drilling success rate may change 
unsuccessful drilling activities could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
also  the company may not be able to obtain the right to drill in areas where it believes there is significant potential for the company 
calliope gas recovery technology 
the company owns the exclusive right to a patented technology known as the calliope gas recovery system 
there are currently three us patents and one canadian patent related to the technology 
two additional patents that mirror the us patents have been applied for in canada 
calliope can achieve substantially lower flowing bottom hole pressure than conventional production methods because it does not rely on reservoir pressure to lift liquids 
in many reservoirs  lower bottom hole pressure can translate into recovery of substantial additional natural gas reserves 
calliope has proven to be reliable and flexible over a wide range of applications on wells the company owns and operates 
it has also proven to be consistently successful 
accordingly  the company is implementing strategies designed to expand the population of wells on which it can install calliope 
realizing calliope s value continues to be one of the company s top priorities 
the company is focused on three fronts to increase the number of calliope installations expanding the geographic region for purchasing calliope candidate wells from third parties  joint ventures with larger companies  and drilling wells into low pressure gas reservoirs for the purpose of using calliope to recover stranded natural gas reserves 
calliope drilling project during  the company entered into a joint venture with redman energy holdings ii  lp to drill wells for the purpose of using its patented calliope gas recovery system to recover stranded gas reserves 
redman energy holdings is an affiliate of redman energy corporation  a privately held  houston based exploration and production company 
redman is affiliated with natural gas partners  a highly respected industry funding source  and brings a wealth of knowledge and a solid operating foundation in the project area 
drilling will concentrate on previously mature  prolific fields containing significant stranded gas 
in its initial phases  the joint venture plans to invest up to  to acquire leases  drill new wells  and install calliope principally in south and east texas 
drilling will target large gas fields that were abandoned when natural gas prices were considerably lower than today  and when technologies to remove fluids from wellbores were much less effective than calliope 
the company presently expects to fund its share of the joint venture from existing cash and future cash flow 
access to fields and drilling locations are generally available through leasing or acquiring interests in old fields 
the company believes this project is a target rich opportunity for the company to take control of expanding its calliope operations 
wells are expected to range in depth from  to  feet 
reserves are projected to range from to bcfe billion cubic feet of gas equivalent per well  with beginning production rates ranging from to  mcf per day 
average drilling economics are expected to include payouts of approximately two years 
several prospects are currently owned by redman and several are in various stages of leasing 
in addition  redman has a committed rig that will be available for the project 
drilling is expected to commence during the second quarter of fiscal several of the old fields currently owned by redman contain very significant stranded gas reserves due to their large reservoir volume and high remaining pressure 
the company believes that calliope will recover billions of cubic feet of gas from these fields by pulling down reservoir pressure to previously unachievable levels 
this drilling project will be the company s first opportunity to use calliope to recover stranded reserves from an entire field 
the company believes that drilling new wells for calliope will provide a repeatable opportunity to lease large areas for systematic re development 
in addition  the company intends to install optimum casing and tubular sizes to substantially improve reserves and production compared to installing calliope on existing wells where undersized tubulars often impede calliope s performance 
although there are always risks associated with drilling  the company considers this to be low risk  development type drilling because it involves areas known to be productive 
the company believes that drilling wells into under pressured reservoirs without damaging the reservoir with drilling fluids is key to the success of the project 
if that can be done successfully  the company believes that calliope can be used to recover stranded gas reserves that can estimated with a high degree of confidence 
purchasing calliope candidate wells calliope systems are currently installed on wells owned and operated by the company 
the wells are located in oklahoma  texas and louisiana  and range in depth from  to  feet 
they represent the most rigorous applications for calliope because the wells were either totally dead or uneconomic at the time calliope was installed 
in addition  prior to the time calliope was installed  many of the reservoirs were damaged by the parting shots of previous operators 
initial calliope production rates range up to mcfd thousand cubic feet of gas per day and average per well calliope reserves for non prototype wells are estimated to be bcf 
one of the company s early calliope installations  the jc carroll well  has now produced almost a billion cubic feet of gas using calliope 
calliope operations have recently been expanded into texas and louisiana with two installations in southwest texas and one in louisiana 
the company considers texas and louisiana to be very fertile areas for calliope and has retained personnel and opened a houston office to focus exclusively on calliope 
in general  higher gas prices have made it increasingly difficult for the company to purchase wells for its calliope system 
in addition  higher gas prices have provided the incentive for other companies to perform high risk procedures parting shots in an attempt to revive wells prior to abandoning or selling the wells 
these parting shots often result in severe reservoir damage that renders wells unsuitable for calliope 
in central louisiana  the company recently installed calliope on a  foot well 
calliope immediately restored the well to economic production making about mcfe per day 
in mid  a calliope system was installed on the  foot wallace well located in beckham county  oklahoma 
the well was dead after having a severe casing leak that dumped an indeterminable amount of corrosive water on the productive formation 
due to the well s high reserve potential  calliope is being used to remove the water in an attempt to restore production 
to date  only minor amounts of gas are being produced  indicating that the casing leak may have damaged the reservoir beyond repair 
a calliope system was also recently installed on the  foot laubhan friesen well located in blaine county  oklahoma 
the well was dead due to apparent reservoir damage from the operations of the previous owner 
the objective is to attempt to use calliope to remove an emulsion from the wellbore in order to restore production 
joint ventures with third parties in an effort to increase the number of calliope installations  the company is seeking joint ventures with larger companies 
presentations have been made to a select group of companies  including majors and large independents 
all of the companies have expressed a keen interest in calliope  and joint venture discussions are continuing with a number of the companies  including evaluation of candidate wells 
the joint venture negotiation process has taken longer than expected because there are many decision points within large companies that cause delays 
nevertheless  the company continues to dedicate resources and make efforts as it believes that the company will eventually be successful in the joint venture area 
operations summary 
during the past two years  the company has significantly expanded and diversified its operations with the objective of sustaining its production and reserve growth rate 
the company believes that  over time  each of its four drilling projects will add significant production and reserves at a reasonable cost and risk 
in particular  the company believes that the calliope drilling project presents excellent potential for adding significant production and reserves  and that the project will allow the company to better control the monetization of its calliope gas recovery technology

the effective tax rate was in and critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
although actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  the company believes that its estimates are reasonable and that actual results will not vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
the company believes the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties  the accounting for oil and natural gas reserves  and the estimate of its asset retirement obligations 
oil and gas properties 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for costs related to its oil and natural gas properties 
capitalized costs included in the full cost pool are depleted on an aggregate basis using the units of production method 
depreciation  depletion and amortization is a significant component of oil and natural gas properties 
a change in proved reserves without a corresponding change in capitalized costs will cause the depletion rate to increase or decrease 
both the volume of proved reserves and any estimated future expenditures used for the depletion calculation are based on estimates such as those described under oil and gas reserves below 
the capitalized costs in the full cost pool are subject to a quarterly ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved oil and natural gas reserves discounted at percent plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties less any associated tax effects 
if such capitalized costs exceed the ceiling  the company will record a write down to the extent of such excess as a non cash charge to earnings 
any such write down will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and result in lower depreciation and depletion in future periods 
a write down may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
the company has made only one ceiling write down in its year history 
that write down was made in after oil prices fell and natural gas prices fell between fiscal year end and changes in oil and natural gas prices have historically had the most significant impact on the company s ceiling test 
in general  the ceiling is lower when prices are lower 
even though oil and natural gas prices can be highly volatile over weeks and even days  the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of the test period be used and held constant 
the resulting valuation is a snapshot as of that day and  thus  is generally not indicative of a true fair value that would be placed on the company s reserves by the company or by an independent third party 
therefore  the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on the company s assessment of future prices or costs  but rather are based on prices and costs in effect as of the end the test period 
oil and gas reserves 
the determination of depreciation and depletion expense as well as ceiling test write downs related to the recorded value of the company s oil and natural gas properties are highly dependent on the estimates of the proved oil and natural gas reserves 
oil and natural gas reserves include proved reserves that represent estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their values  including many factors beyond the company s control 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas ultimately recovered and the corresponding lifting costs associated with the recovery of these reserves 
the company s reserves  and reserve values  are concentrated in properties significant properties 
some of the significant properties are individual wells and others are multi well properties 
at october   the significant properties represent of the company s total properties but a disproportionate of the discounted value at of the company s reserves 
individual wells on which the company s patented liquid lift system is installed comprise of the significant properties and represent of the discounted reserve value of such properties 
new wells comprise of the significant properties and represent of the discounted value of such properties 
estimates of reserve quantities and values for certain significant properties must be viewed as being subject to significant change as more data about the properties becomes available 
such properties include wells with limited production histories and properties with proved undeveloped or proved non producing reserves 
in addition  the company s patented liquid lift system is generally installed on mature wells 
as such  they contain older down hole equipment that is more subject to failure than new equipment 
the failure of such equipment  particularly casing  can result in complete loss of a well 
historically  performance of the company s wells has not caused significant revisions in its proved reserves 
price changes will affect the economic lives of oil and gas properties and  therefore  price changes may cause reserve revisions 
price changes have not caused significant proved reserve revisions by the company except in when a decline in oil prices and a decline in natural gas prices resulted in an reduction in estimated proved reserves 
based upon this historical experience  the company does not believe its reserve estimates are particularly sensitive to prices changes within historical ranges 
one measure of the life of the company s proved reserves can be calculated by dividing proved reserves at fiscal year end by production for fiscal year this measure yields an average reserve life of years 
since this measure is an average  by definition  some of the company s properties will have a life shorter than the average and some will have a life longer than the average 
the expected economic lives of the company s properties may vary widely depending on  among other things  the size and quality  natural gas and oil prices  possible curtailments in consumption by purchasers  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
as a result  the company s actual future net cash flows from proved reserves could be materially different from its estimates 
asset retirement obligations 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations requires that the company estimate the future cost of asset retirement obligations  discount that cost to its present value  and record a corresponding asset and liability in its consolidated balance sheets 
the values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates  including future abandonment costs  inflation  market risk premiums  useful life  and cost of capital 
the nature of these estimates requires the company to make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations 
revisions to the estimates may be required based on such things as changes to cost estimates or the timing of future cash outlays 
any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no
