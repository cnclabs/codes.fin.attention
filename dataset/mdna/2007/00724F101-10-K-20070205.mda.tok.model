critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  stock based compensation  goodwill and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical accounting policies  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with current us generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and are subject to change 
in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions  if any  must be deferred 
in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate pricing for those products and services 
in addition  we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers 
our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenues could differ from actual events  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
we have to estimate provisions for returns which are recorded against our revenues 
in determining our estimate for returns  and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue  we rely upon historical data  the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel  the rate at which our product sells through to the end user  product plans and other factors 
our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs 
more or less product may be returned from what was estimated 
the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated 
our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs 
there could be a delay in the release of our products 
these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of  and account for stock based compensation in accordance with  statement of financial accounting standard sfas r during the first quarter of fiscal we elected the modified prospective method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience 
as permitted by staff accounting bulletin sab  we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on zero coupon yields implied from us treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants and employee stock purchase plan shares 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there currently is no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
the guidance in sfas r and sab is relatively new 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sfas r disclosures 
goodwill impairment we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis  during the second quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently  if facts and circumstances warrant a review 
we make judgments about goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
the timing of an impairment test may result in charges to our statements of income in our current reporting period that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill  we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects the asset relates to  consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits could result in impairment charges  which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
conversely  less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges  higher net income and higher asset values 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service for our fiscal  and tax returns  primarily related to our intercompany transfer pricing 
although we believe our judgments  assumptions and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
results of operations overview of during fiscal  we continued to focus on delivering market leading technologies and software that are redefining business  entertainment  and personal communications 
our solutions  which utilize industry standards for producing and delivering content that allow people to engage with information virtually anywhere at anytime  drove strong revenue and earnings growth in the year 
in our creative solution segment  we generated strong year over year growth based on the addition of macromedia products to our product portfolio and the performance of our creative suite products family 
in addition  to capitalize on the broad adoption of digital video on the web  we introduced production studio a suite of video products including adobe premiere pro  adobe after effects  adobe audition  and adobe encore this new release drove strong year over year growth in the digital video category of our creative business

with regard to our product backlog  our experience is that the actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects 
for example  prior to the finalization and release of new products  we may have significant levels of orders for new product releases 
our backlog of unfulfilled orders at the end of fiscal  other than those associated with new product releases  those pending credit review and those not shipped due to the application of our global distributor inventory policy  was approximately of fourth quarter fiscal revenue

net losses related to our investments in adobe ventures and cost method investments write downs due to other than temporary declines in value of our marketable equity securities gains from sale of short term investments gains from sale of equity investments gains losses on stock warrants total investment gain loss the increase in our investment gain from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to the sale of our investment in atom entertainment  inc during the fourth quarter of fiscal we are uncertain of future investment gains or losses as they are primarily dependent upon market conditions and the operations of the underlying investee companies 
interest and other income the largest component of interest and other income is interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term fixed income investments  but also includes gains and losses on the sale of fixed income investments  foreign exchange transactions including hedging gains and losses  and interest expense

interest and other income increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to higher interest income as a result of higher levels of cash and higher interest rates during fiscal  as well as higher gains on our foreign currency hedging program 
income tax provision fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal provision percentage of total revenues effective tax rate our effective tax rate increased five percentage points during fiscal compared to fiscal the net increase is primarily due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit on december  and because the effective tax rate included a tax benefit recognized in connection with the repatriation of certain foreign earnings 
in december  after the end of adobe s fiscal year  the federal research and development tax credit was retroactively extended from january  until december  which includes an month period in adobe s fiscal year 
the impact of this new tax law will be reflected in our fiscal results including an approximately million discrete item in our first quarter fiscal results for the credit relating to fiscal our effective tax rate decreased four percentage points during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to a tax benefit recognized as a result of the release of certain deferred tax liabilities in connection with the repatriation of certain foreign earnings 
in addition  our effective tax rate decreased one percentage point due to a variety of factors  including higher profits earned by our international trading company which are taxed at a lower statutory rate and a reduction of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal cash  cash equivalents and short term investments working capital stockholders equity our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue 
the primary uses of cash are payroll salaries  bonuses  and benefits  general operating expenses marketing  travel  office rent and cost of product revenue 
another source of cash is proceeds from the exercise of employee options and another use of cash is our stock repurchase program  which is detailed below 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal  of million  primarily comprised net income  net of non cash related expenses 
the primary working capital source of cash was a decrease in other current assets and increases in income taxes payable and deferred revenue 
income taxes payable increased primarily due to higher current tax liabilities related to overall increased taxable income 
deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance and support obligations 
working capital uses of cash included an increase in trade receivables and decreases in accrued expenses and accrued restructuring 
our trade receivables increased due to an increase in revenue 
as compared to the same period last year  our days sales outstanding in trade receivables dso increased from days to days 
the increase in dso was due to an increase in revenue in the latter part of the year due to timing of product shipments and an increase in certain receivables from the macromedia acquisition which have longer payment terms 
accrued expenses decreased because of compensation related costs and other expenses 
accrued restructuring decreased because of payments made during fiscal  please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information

working capital uses of cash included a decrease in income taxes payable due to tax payments made for both agreed and disputed tax assessments 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal of million increased from net cash used in fiscal of million due to the net cash acquired with macromedia and due to the sale of our minority equity investment in atom entertainment  inc these proceeds were partially offset by purchases of long term investments and acquisitions of property  plant  and equipment as well as net purchases of short term investments in fiscal net cash used for investing activities in fiscal of million decreased from net cash used in fiscal of million because there was not an investment in a lease receivable related to our corporate headquarter office buildings as there was in this was partially offset by higher net purchases of short term investments and payments for acquisition costs in fiscal net cash used for financing activities in fiscal of million increased from net cash used in fiscal of million primarily due to the purchases of treasury stock 
cash used during fiscal was partially offset by the proceeds related to the issuance of the treasury stock from exercises of employee stock options

in addition  we plan to invest approximately million in venture capital over the next three to five years in companies leveraging our platform technologies 
adobe uses professional investment management firms to manage most of our invested cash 
external investment firms managed  on average  of adobe s invested balances during fiscal within the us  the fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in municipal bonds 
outside of the us  our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in us treasury notes and highly rated corporate notes 
the balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market and enhanced money market funds for working capital purposes 
as of december   million of the securities now classified as short term investments have structural features that allow us to sell the securities at par within days and thus retain similar liquidity characteristics as cash equivalents 
all investments are made according to policies approved by the board of directors 
our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances may decline during fiscal in the event of a weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay 
however  based on our current business plan and revenue prospects  we believe that our existing balances together with our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
in addition  we have received board approval to execute a million credit facility which is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of fiscal this credit facility will provide backup liquidity for general corporate purposes for a period of up to years 
cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the risks detailed in item a  risk factors 
stock repurchase program on going dilution coverage to facilitate our stock repurchase program  designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances  we repurchase shares in the open market and from time to time enter into structured stock repurchase agreements with third parties 
authorization to repurchase shares to cover on going dilution is not subject to expiration 
however  this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and is subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our board of directors from time to time 
refer to part ii  item c in this annual report for share repurchases during the quarter ended december  as part of this program  on april   the board of directors approved the use of an additional billion for stock repurchase commencing upon the close of the macromedia acquisition 
this additional billion in stock repurchases was completed by the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal and  we entered into several structured repurchase agreements with large financial institutions  whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of billion and million  respectively 
we entered into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume weighted average price of our common stock 
we only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions 
there were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases 
under the terms of the agreements  there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us 
the financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term 
the parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are the total notional amount of the contract  the number of trading days in the contract  the number of trading days in the interval  and the average vwap of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount 
for fiscal  the billion prepayment was classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet at the payment date  though only shares physically delivered to us by december  are excluded from the denominator in the computation of earnings per share 
all outstanding structured repurchase agreements as of december  will expire on or before july  as of december  approximately million of up front payments remained under the agreements 
at the beginning of fiscal  we entered into an additional structured repurchase agreement with a large financial institution  whereupon we provided the financial institution with a prepayment of million which will be classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet

off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations our principal commitments as of december   consist of obligations under operating leases  royalty agreements and various service agreements 
we expect to fulfill all of the following commitments from our working capital 
lease commitments the two lease agreements discussed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements are subject to standard financial covenants 
as of december  we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants 
we expect to remain within compliance in the next months 
we are comfortable with these limitations and believe they will not impact our credit or cash in the coming year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our lease commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december  total less than year years years over years total non cancelable operating leases  net of sublease income these amounts are net of sublease income 
see note of notes to consolidated statements for further detail regarding our future commitments under these non cancelable operating leases 
royalties we have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue 
guarantees the lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees 
under fin  the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after december   must be recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
as such  we recognized a million liability related to the east and west towers lease that was extended in august this liability is recorded in other long term liabilities with the offsetting entry recorded as prepaid rent in other assets 
the balance will be amortized to the income statement over the life of the lease 
as of december   the unamortized portion of the fair value of the residual value guarantee remaining in other long term liabilities and prepaid rent was million 
indemnifications in the normal course of business  we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations 
to the extent permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
as part of our limited partnership interests in adobe ventures  we have provided a general indemnification to granite ventures  an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of adobe ventures  for certain events or occurrences while granite ventures is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity provided that granite ventures acts in good faith on behalf of the partnerships 
we are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim  but believe the risk of having to make any payments under this general indemnification to be remote 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non trading purposes 
foreign currency hedging instruments we transact business in foreign countries  in us dollars and in various foreign currencies 
in europe and japan  transactions that are denominated in euro or yen subject us to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to yen denominated product and support revenue in japan and euro denominated product and support revenue in certain european countries 
in fiscal  and  our revenue exposures were billion yen  billion yen  and billion yen  respectively 
in fiscal  and  our revenue exposures were million euros  million euros  and million euros  respectively 
our japanese operating expenses are in yen and our european operating expenses are primarily in euro  which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to yen and euro denominated product revenue 
in addition  we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts 
these contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses  however  the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
we also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with forward and purchased option contracts 
our revenue hedging policy is intended to neutralize the impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements 
at december   total outstanding contracts were million which included the notional equivalent of million in euro  million in yen  and million in other foreign currencies 
these hedges are foreign currency forward exchange contracts which hedged our balance sheet exposures 
in addition  we had the notional equivalent of million in purchased put option contracts which hedged our forecasted revenue 
as of december   all contracts were set to expire at various times through july the bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance 
however  to mitigate that risk we only contract with counterparties with specific minimum rating requirements 
in addition  our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty 
in addition we also have long term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non usd functional currency foreign subsidiaries 
for the fiscal years ending december  and december  this long term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of million and million  respectively 
at this time we do not hedge these long term investment exposures 
economic hedging hedges of forecasted transactions we use foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these foreign exchange option contracts  carried at fair value  may have maturities between one and twelve months 
such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the japanese yen and the euro 
we enter into these foreign exchange option contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business  and accordingly  they are not speculative in nature 
we record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  until the forecasted transaction occurs 
when the forecasted transaction occurs  we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue 
in the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur  or it becomes probable that it will not occur  we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to interest and other income loss on the consolidated statement of income at that time 
for the fiscal year ended december   there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur 
see also note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
balance sheet hedging hedging of foreign currency assets and liabilities we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as other income loss 
these derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
at december   the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of days or less 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a and shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
for option contracts  the black scholes equation model was used 
for forward contracts  duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency 
a and increase in the value of the us dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by million and million  respectively 
conversely  a and decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by million and million  respectively 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
as a general rule  we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists 
for example  in many countries revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures  primarily related to operating expenses  on an ongoing basis 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program

equity investments we are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities 
as of december   our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at million compared to million at december  the increase was due to distributions from adobe ventures of the fair value of two previously private companies that went public during fiscal the investments were reclassified from long term to short term 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that the fair values of these securities could adversely change in the near term 
we have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
our policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each company s cash position  earnings revenue outlook  stock price performance over the past six months  liquidity and management ownership 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline in value exists in one of our marketable equity securities  it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related write down in our consolidated statements of income 
the following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities that are sensitive to changes in the stock market 
fair value deteriorations of  and were selected for illustrative purposes because none is more likely to occur than another 
marketable equity securities fixed income investments at december   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  of  million compared to  million at december   an increase of 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income investments 
the table below separates the remaining maturities of our fixed income securities into segments  based on stated maturities  to show the approximate exposure to interest rates 
a significant proportion of securities classified as due after three years  based on the stated maturity  have structural features that allow us to sell the securities  at par  in less than three years 
due within one year due within two years due within three years due after three years total a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus   or basis points over six month and twelve month time horizons 
the following table represents the potential decrease to the value of our fixed income securities given a negative shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis 
month horizon month horizon we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios 
our investment policy limits the maximum weighted average duration of all invested funds to years 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one security issue  limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument 
privately held investments we have direct investments  as well as indirect investments through adobe ventures  in several privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in the start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky  as the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize  and we could lose a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies 
it is our policy to review privately held investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies
