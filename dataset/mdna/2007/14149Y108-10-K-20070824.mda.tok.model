the revised segment reporting discussed above is reflected throughout this report for all periods presented 
historical figures are presented in a manner that is consistent with the revised segment reporting 
the four segments align within two major sectors healthcare supply chain services and clinical and medical products 
healthcare supply chain services includes the healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical and healthcare supply chain services medical segments  and is focused on the company s foundational logistics and distribution capabilities 
clinical and medical products includes the clinical technologies and services and medical products manufacturing segments  and is focused on higher margin  faster growing medical products businesses 
the following discussion is based on the four reportable segments as they were structured as of and for the fiscal year ended june  healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical general 
through its healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical segment  the company distributes a broad line of branded and generic pharmaceutical products  over the counter healthcare products and consumer products collectively  pharmaceutical products 
the company s pharmaceutical supply chain business formerly referred to as the pharmaceutical distribution business is one of the country s leading full service wholesale distributors to retail customers including chain and independent drug stores and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers  hospitals and alternate care providers including mail order pharmacies located throughout the united states 
as a full service wholesale distributor  the pharmaceutical supply chain business complements its distribution activities by offering a broad range of support services to assist its customers in maintaining and helping to improve the efficiency and quality of their services 
these support services include  among others online procurement  fulfillment and information provided through cardinal 
com  computerized order entry and order confirmation systems  generic sourcing programs  product movement  inventory and management reports  and consultation on store operations and merchandising 
the company s proprietary software systems feature customized databases specially designed to help its distribution customers order more efficiently  contain costs and monitor their purchases 
in addition  this segment s pharmaceutical supply chain business provides services to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers through distribution service agreements  including distribution services  inventory management services  data reporting services  new product launch support and contract and chargeback administration services 
this segment also operates a pharmaceutical repackaging and distribution program for chain and independent drug store customers as well as alternate care customers 
this segment operates centralized nuclear pharmacies that prepare and deliver radiopharmaceuticals for use in nuclear imaging and other procedures in hospitals and clinics 
this segment also provides third party logistics support services  distributes therapeutic plasma to hospitals  clinics and other providers located in the united states and manufactures and markets generic pharmaceutical products for sale to hospitals  clinics and pharmacies in the united kingdom 
after acquiring specialtyscripts  llc specialtyscripts during fiscal  this segment operates a specialty pharmacy providing prescription fulfillment and clinical care services directly to individual patients requiring highly intensive therapies 

table of contents through this segment  the company is a franchisor of apothecary style retail pharmacies through its medicine shoppe international  inc and medicap pharmacies incorporated medicap  and together with medicine shoppe international  inc  medicine shoppe franchise systems in the united states and abroad 
medicine shoppe also owns and operates a limited number of retail pharmacy locations 
pharmaceutical supply chain business model 
this segment s pharmaceutical supply chain business maintains prime vendor relationships with its customers that streamline the purchasing process by reducing the number of vendors 
using a prime vendor offers customers logistical savings and fosters partnerships between the customers and distributor that result in greater efficiency and lower costs 
five primary factors influence the pharmaceutical supply chain business gross margin for pharmaceutical products customer discounts  manufacturer cash discounts  distribution service agreement fees  pharmaceutical price appreciation and manufacturer rebates and incentives 
in general  the company sells pharmaceutical products to its customers at a contract price below the manufacturer s published price or another designated price at the time of sale in either case  the manufacturer s designated price 
the term customer discounts refers to the difference in dollars between the sales price to customers for pharmaceutical products net of discounts  rebates and incentives given to customers and the manufacturer s designated price for those pharmaceutical products sold in a particular period 
the term manufacturer cash discounts refers to the aggregate amount in dollars of cash incentives the company receives from manufacturers for prompt payment of invoices 
manufacturer cash discounts are typically a fixed percentage of purchases from the manufacturer 
the term distribution service agreement fees refers to aggregate fees paid by manufacturers for services provided by the company related to the distribution of the manufacturers products 
the company s fee for service arrangements are reflected in written distribution service agreements  and may be a fee or a fee plus pharmaceutical price appreciation as described below 
in certain instances  the company must achieve certain performance criteria to receive the maximum fees under the agreement 
the fee is typically a fixed percentage of either the company s purchases from the manufacturer or the company s sales of the manufacturer s products to its customers 
the term pharmaceutical price appreciation refers to the impact on gross margin in dollars of pharmaceutical price appreciation for products sold during a particular period 
the impact happens when the company is able to purchase inventory  hold that inventory when a manufacturer increases the price and sell that product at the higher price 
the company continues to generate gross margin from the sale of some manufacturers products from pharmaceutical price appreciation without receiving distribution service agreement fees 
if the frequency or rate of pharmaceutical price appreciation slows  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the term manufacturer rebates and incentives refers to discounts the company receives from manufacturers as a result of competition among manufacturers  including manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals  in pricing their products 
manufacturer rebates and incentives are based on either the company s purchases from the manufacturer or the company s sales of the manufacturer s products to its customers 
the company may receive other incentives from manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals for an improved position of the manufacturers products in the company s various generic formulary programs 
a formulary program is a generic pharmaceutical purchasing program that helps pharmacies maximize their cost savings with a broad selection of rebate eligible and lower priced generic pharmaceuticals 
the company generally earns the highest margins on generic pharmaceuticals during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product in the marketplace because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally deflationary 
in sum  the company s pharmaceutical supply chain business generates gross margin primarily to the extent that the selling price to its customers  net of customer discounts  exceeds in the aggregate cost of products sold  net of manufacturer cash discounts  distribution service agreement fees  pharmaceutical price appreciation and manufacturer rebates and incentives 

table of contents with respect to its customers  the healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical segment differentiates between bulk and non bulk customers because bulk customers generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than that generated by non bulk customers 
bulk customers consist of customers centralized warehouse operations and customers mail order businesses 
all other customers are classified as non bulk customers for example  retail stores  pharmacies  hospitals and alternate care sites 
bulk customers include the warehouse operations of retail chains whose retail stores are classified as non bulk customers

in addition  the company evaluates its portfolio of businesses on an ongoing basis to identify businesses for possible divestiture 
for additional information concerning certain of the transactions described above  see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
customers the company s largest customers  cvs corporation cvs and walgreen co 
walgreens  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s revenue for fiscal the aggregate of the company s five largest customers  including cvs and walgreens  accounted for approximately of the company s revenue for fiscal all of the company s business with its five largest customers is included in its healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical segment 
the loss of one or more of these five customers could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
businesses in each of the company s reportable segments have agreements with group purchasing organizations gpos that act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members 
approximately of the company s revenue for fiscal was derived from gpo members through the contractual arrangements established with novation  llc novation and premier purchasing partners  lp premier  the company s two largest gpo relationships in terms of member revenue 
generally  compliance by gpo members with gpo vendor selections is voluntary 
as such  the company believes the loss of any of the company s agreements with a 
table of contents gpo would not mean the loss of sales to all members of the gpo  although the loss of such an agreement could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s concentrations of credit risk and major customers 
suppliers the company obtains its products from many different suppliers 
products obtained from the company s five largest suppliers accounted on a combined basis for approximately of the company s revenue during fiscal no one supplier s products accounted for more than of the company s revenue in fiscal overall  the company believes that its relationships with its suppliers are good 
the loss of certain suppliers could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition if alternative sources of supply were unavailable at reasonable prices 
healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical historically  a significant portion of pharmaceutical supply chain s gross margin was derived from the company s ability to purchase inventory  hold that inventory when a manufacturer increased prices and sell that product at the higher price 
beginning in fiscal  branded pharmaceutical manufacturers began to seek greater control over the amount of product available in the supply chain and  as a result  began to change their sales practices by restricting the volume of product available for purchase by wholesalers 
in addition  manufacturers sought additional services from the company  including providing data concerning product sales and distribution patterns 
the company believes that manufacturers sought these changes to provide them with greater visibility over product demand and movement in the market and to increase product safety and integrity by reducing the risks associated with product being available to  and distributed in  the secondary market 
these changes significantly reduced the pharmaceutical price appreciation earned by the company 
in response to these developments  the company established a compensation system with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers that is significantly less dependent on manufacturers pricing practices  and is based on the services provided by the company to meet the unique distribution requirements of each manufacturer s products 
during fiscal  the company worked with individual branded pharmaceutical manufacturers to define fee for service terms that compensate the company based on the services being provided to such manufacturers 
this transition was completed during fiscal these new arrangements have moderated the seasonality of earnings which have historically reflected the pattern of manufacturers price increases 
the company s fee for service arrangements are reflected in written distribution service agreements 
distribution service agreements between the company and certain branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally range from a one year term with an automatic renewal feature to a five year term 
these agreements generally cannot be terminated unless mutually agreed by the parties  a breach of the agreement occurs that is not cured  or a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency event occurs 
some agreements allow the manufacturer to terminate the agreement without cause within a defined notice period 
see the pharmaceutical supply chain business model discussion under reportable segments healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical above for more information regarding distribution service agreement fees 
healthcare supply chain services medical the company s healthcare supply chain services medical segment purchases products from a wide range of medical products suppliers for distribution to its customers 
this segment  at times  purchases medical and laboratory products from suppliers other than the original manufacturer of such products 
certain manufacturers have adopted policies limiting the ability of the segment s businesses to purchase products from anyone other than the manufacturer 
if this practice becomes more widespread  the ability of the healthcare supply chain services medical segment to purchase products from other distributors  as well as its ability to sell excess inventories to other distributors  may be impaired 
this could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents clinical technologies and services and medical products manufacturing the clinical technologies and services segment uses purchased components in the products it manufactures  including custom designed components and assemblies 
the medical products manufacturing segment uses a broad range of raw materials  compounds and purchased components in the products it manufactures  including latex and resins 
in certain circumstances  the company s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by raw material or component cost increases because the company may not be able to fully recover the increased costs from the customer or offset the increased cost through productivity improvements 
in addition  although most of these raw materials or components are generally available  certain raw materials or components used by the company s manufacturing businesses may be available only from a limited number of suppliers 
where there are a limited number of suppliers  the company may experience shortages in supply  and as a result  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
with respect to certain products  the clinical technologies and services and medical products manufacturing segments contract with third party manufacturers for all or some aspects of their product manufacturing 
these segments also source certain finished products from third party suppliers 
competition the company operates in markets that are highly competitive 
healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical in the healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical segment  the company s pharmaceutical supply chain business faces competition in the united states from two other national wholesale distributors mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation and a number of smaller regional wholesale distributors  self warehousing chains  direct selling manufacturers  specialty distributors and third party logistics companies on the basis of a value proposition that includes pricing  breadth of product lines  service offerings and support services 
the pharmaceutical supply chain business has narrow profit margins and  accordingly  the company s earnings depend significantly on its ability to compete effectively on the pricing of pharmaceutical products  distribute a large volume and variety of products efficiently  establish and maintain low cost sourcing arrangements with generic pharmaceutical manufacturers  provide quality support services  enter into and maintain satisfactory arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers so it is compensated for the services it provides manufacturers  and effectively manage inventory and other working capital items

this segment s nuclear pharmacies compete based upon a variety of factors  including price  quality  customer service  proprietary technologies or capabilities and responsiveness 
with respect to pharmacy franchising operations  a few smaller franchisors compete with medicine shoppe in the franchising of pharmacies  with competition being based primarily upon financial assistance offered to qualified franchisees  aggregation of purchase volume  operational support and assistance  benefits offered to both the pharmacist and the customer  access to third party programs  brand awareness and marketing support and pricing

the company is subject to extensive local  state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse 
the federal government continues to scrutinize potentially fraudulent practices in the healthcare industry in an attempt to minimize the cost that such practices have on medicare  medicaid and other government healthcare programs 
in addition  state attorney general offices have investigated  and may in the future investigate  the company s operations for compliance with such laws and regulations 
for example  certain state attorney general offices are alleging that the company has caused medicaid reimbursements to be paid for repackaged pharmaceuticals without paying the required medicaid rebate and that certain of the company s repackaging business practices violate the medicaid rebate statute 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the state attorneys general investigation related to repackaged pharmaceuticals 
many of these laws and regulations are complex and broadly written and could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial  regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require the company to make changes in its operations 
if the company fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations  it could suffer civil damages and criminal penalties  including the loss of licenses or its ability to participate in medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 
the deficit reduction act of dra includes provisions that change the prescription drug reimbursement formula for generic pharmaceuticals under medicaid to a reimbursement formula based on the lowest average manufacturers price in an effort to reduce costs for that program 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms released a final rule implementing these provisions on july  under the final rule  the major changes with respect to generic pharmaceuticals are expected to become effective in the second and third quarters of fiscal the final rule also requires for the first time public reporting by the manufacturers of the average manufacturers price as defined by cms for branded and generic pharmaceuticals 
the company is continuing to work with its customers and the regulatory agencies in this process 
the company is currently developing plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative changes 
if the company fails to successfully 
table of contents develop and implement such plans  this change in reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements and other provisions of the dra could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the costs associated with complying with the various applicable federal regulations  as well as state and foreign regulations  could be significant and the failure to comply with all such legal requirements could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
inventories the company s distribution businesses are generally not required by its customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as may be required to meet service level requirements 
certain supply contracts with us government entities require the company s healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical  healthcare supply chain services medical and clinical technologies and services segments to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands 
the company does not believe that the requirements contained in these us government supply contracts materially impact inventory levels 
the company s customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned  subject to restocking fees  and only allow customers to return products that can be added back to inventory and resold at full value  or that can be returned to vendors for credit 
the company s practice is to offer market payment terms to its customers

item a risk factors the risks described below could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and cash flows 
these risks are not the only risks that the company faces 
the company s business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to it or that the company currently considers to be immaterial to its operations 
competitive pressures could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company operates in markets that are highly competitive 
for example  the company s pharmaceutical supply chain business competes with two national wholesale distributors  mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation  and a number of smaller regional wholesale distributors  self warehousing chains  direct selling manufacturers  specialty distributors and third party logistics companies 
in addition  certain of the company s customers have consolidated and may continue to do so in the future 
competitive pressures could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
substantial defaults or a material reduction in purchases of the company s products by large customers could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in recent years  a significant portion of the company s revenue growth has been derived from a limited number of large customers 
the company s largest customers  cvs and walgreens  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s revenue for fiscal the aggregate of the company s five largest customers  including cvs and walgreens  accounted for approximately of the company s revenue for fiscal in addition  cvs and walgreens accounted for and  respectively  of the company s gross trade receivable balance at june  as a result  the company s sales and credit concentration is significant 
any 
table of contents defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases from these or other large customers could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  certain of the company s businesses have entered into agreements with gpos 
approximately of the company s revenue for fiscal was derived from gpo members through the contractual arrangements established with novation and premier 
generally  compliance by gpo members with gpo vendor selections is voluntary 
still  the loss of an agreement with a gpo could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition because the company could lose customers or have to reduce prices as a result 
changes in the united states healthcare environment could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the healthcare industry has changed significantly over time and the company expects the industry to continue to change significantly in the future 
some of these changes  such as adverse changes in government funding of healthcare services  legislation or regulations governing the privacy of patient information  or the delivery or pricing of or reimbursement for pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits  may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of the company s products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for the company s products and services 
the company expects continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing 
changes in the healthcare industry s or any suppliers pricing  reimbursement  selling  inventory  distribution or supply policies or practices  or changes in the company s customer mix  could also significantly reduce the company s revenue  increase the company s costs or otherwise significantly impact its results of operations 
healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic pharmaceuticals will increase over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain pharmaceutical patents 
a decrease in the availability or changes in pricing of or reimbursements for generic pharmaceuticals could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government  including state departments of health  state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies  to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit  adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system 
several states have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations  including pedigree tracking requirements  that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system 
florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and california has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using electronic pedigrees 
regulations requiring pedigree and chain of custody tracking in certain circumstances adopted under the federal prescription drug marketing act became effective on december  these federal regulations have been challenged in a case brought by secondary distributors 
a preliminary injunction was issued by the federal district court for the eastern district of new york that temporarily enjoined implementation of these federal regulations 
these laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with the company s pharmaceutical supply chain business  and could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the deficit reduction act of dra includes provisions that change the prescription drug reimbursement formula for generic pharmaceuticals under medicaid to a reimbursement formula based on the lowest average manufacturers price in an effort to reduce costs for that program 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms released a final rule implementing these provisions on july  under the final rule  the major changes with respect to generic pharmaceuticals are expected to become effective in the second and third quarters of fiscal the final rule also requires for the first time public reporting by the manufacturers of the average manufacturers price as defined by cms for branded and generic pharmaceuticals 
the company is continuing to work with its customers and the regulatory agencies in this process 
the company is currently developing plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative changes 
if the company fails to successfully develop and implement such plans  this change in reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements and other provisions of the dra could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents the company s healthcare supply chain services medical segment  at times  purchases medical surgical and laboratory products from vendors other than the original manufacturer of such products 
certain manufacturers have adopted policies limiting the ability of the segment s businesses to purchase products from anyone other than the manufacturer 
if this practice becomes more widespread  the ability of the healthcare supply chain services medical segment to purchase products from other distributors  as well as its ability to sell excess inventories to other distributors  may be impaired 
this could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s pharmaceutical supply chain business is subject to appreciation in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices  which subjects the company to risks and uncertainties 
some distribution service agreements entered into by the company with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers have a price appreciation based component to them in addition to a service fee component 
the company also continues to generate gross margin from the sale of some manufacturers products from pharmaceutical price appreciation without receiving distribution service agreement fees 
if the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price appreciation slows  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  the pharmaceutical supply chain business distributes generic pharmaceuticals  which are generally subject to price deflation 
if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company is subject to legal proceedings that could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company is involved in a number of legal proceedings  which  if decided adversely to the company or settled by the company on unfavorable terms  could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company discusses these legal proceedings in greater detail below in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the company s products or services expose it to product and professional liability risks 
the availability of product liability insurance for large companies in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry is generally more limited than insurance available to smaller companies and companies in other industries 
insurance carriers providing product liability insurance to large pharmaceutical and medical device companies generally limit the amount of available policy limits  require larger self insured retentions and include exclusions for certain products 
there can be no assurance that a successful product or professional liability claim would be adequately covered by the company s applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity and  as such  these claims could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated 
the company is subject to various local  state  federal  foreign and transnational laws and regulations  which include the operating and security standards of the dea  the fda  various state boards of pharmacy  state health departments  the nrc  dhhs  the european union member states and other comparable agencies 
certain of the company s subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and or licenses with  and comply with operating and security standards of  the dea  the fda  the nrc  dhhs and various state boards of pharmacy  state health departments and or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution  manufacturing and sale 
although the company believes that it is in compliance  in all material respects  with applicable laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of the company s operations with applicable laws and regulations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or renew existing permits  licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits  licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of the company s businesses 
any noncompliance by the company with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain  renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents the manufacture  distribution and marketing of certain of the company s products are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda 
failure to comply with the requirements of the fda could result in warning letters  product recalls or seizures  monetary sanctions  injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products  civil or criminal sanctions  refusal of the government to grant approvals  restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the alaris se pump recall 
any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in the company and its products which could adversely affect the company s sales 
in addition  third parties may file claims against the company in connection these issues 
the company is also subject to extensive local  state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse 
the federal government continues to scrutinize potentially fraudulent practices in the healthcare industry in an attempt to minimize the cost that such practices have on medicare  medicaid and other government healthcare programs 
in addition  state attorney general offices have investigated  and may in the future investigate  the company s operations for compliance with such laws and regulations 
for example  certain state attorney general offices are alleging that the company has caused medicaid reimbursements to be paid for repackaged pharmaceuticals without paying the required medicaid rebate and that certain of the company s repackaging business practices violate the medicaid rebate statute 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the state attorneys general investigation related to repackaged pharmaceuticals 
many of these laws and regulations are complex and broadly written and could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial  regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require the company to make changes in its operations 
if the company fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations  it could suffer civil damages and criminal penalties  including the loss of licenses or its ability to participate in medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 
circumstances associated with the company s acquisition strategy could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
an important element of the company s growth strategy historically has been the pursuit of acquisitions of other businesses which expand or complement the company s existing businesses 
acquisitions involve risks  including the risk that the company overpays for a business or is unable to obtain the synergies and other expected benefits from acquiring a business in a timely manner  or at all 
integrating acquired businesses also involves a number of special risks  including the following the possibility that management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations  unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems and realizing potential revenue synergies and cost savings  problems assimilating and retaining the management or employees of the acquired company or the company s employees following an acquisition  accounting issues that could arise in connection with  or as a result of  the acquisition of the acquired company  including issues related to internal control over financial reporting  regulatory or compliance issues that could exist for an acquired company or business  challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses  and potential adverse short term effects on results of operations through increased costs or otherwise 
if the company is unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner  its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
consolidating the headquarters of the healthcare supply chain services sector could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
on april   the company announced that it was moving the headquarters of its healthcare supply chain services medical segment and certain corporate functions from waukegan  illinois to the company s corporate headquarters in dublin  ohio 
this consolidation is expected to take place over the next two years 
the consolidation could result in customer service and other business disruptions in the healthcare supply chain services medical segment and challenges in retaining this segment s key employees 
if the company is unable to 
table of contents successfully complete the healthcare supply chain services headquarters consolidation  its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company s future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components  compounds  raw materials and energy 
the company depends on various components  compounds  raw materials  and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products through its clinical technologies and services and medical products manufacturing segments 
it is possible that any of the company s supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters or other events or could be terminated in the future 
any sustained interruption in the company s receipt of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on the company 
in addition  while the company has processes to minimize volatility in component and material pricing  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
proprietary technology protections may not be adequate 
the company relies on a combination of trade secret  patent  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect a number of its products  services and intangible assets 
these proprietary rights are important to the company s ongoing operations 
there can be no assurance that these protections will provide meaningful protection against competitive products or services or otherwise be commercially valuable or that the company will be successful in obtaining additional intellectual property or enforcing its intellectual property rights against unauthorized users 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
the products that the company manufactures or distributes may be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
from time to time  third parties have asserted infringement claims against the company and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future 
while the company believes that the products that it currently manufactures using its proprietary technology do not infringe upon proprietary rights of other parties or that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertions to the contrary  there can be no assurance that the company would not be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others 
the company may be subject to litigation over infringement claims regarding the products it manufactures or distributes 
this type of litigation can be costly and time consuming and could generate significant expenses  damage payments or restrictions or prohibitions on the company s use of its technology  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
in addition  if the company is found to be infringing on proprietary rights of others  the company may be required to develop non infringing technology  obtain a license or cease making  using and or selling the infringing products 
generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products 
during the pendency of these legal challenges  a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution to its legal challenge over the branded product s patent 
the company may distribute that generic product purchased from the generics manufacturer 
as a result  the brand name company may assert infringement claims against the company 
while the company generally obtains indemnity rights from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products  there can be no assurances that these indemnity rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect the company 
risks generally associated with the company s information systems and implementation of a new accounting software system could adversely affect the company s results of operations or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
the company relies on information systems in its business to obtain  rapidly process  analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers  
table of contents receive  process and ship orders on a timely basis  manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers  process payments to suppliers  and facilitate the manufacturing and assembly of medical products 
the company s results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted  damaged by unforeseen events or fail for any extended period of time  including due to the actions of third parties 
in addition  in july  the company began implementing a new accounting software system and will transition selected financial processes to the new system throughout fiscal and if the company does not effectively implement this system or if the system does not operate as intended  it could adversely affect the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
tax legislation initiatives or challenges to the company s tax positions could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company is a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions 
as such  the company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal  state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions 
from time to time  various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect the company s tax positions 
there can be no assurance that the company s effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives 
in addition  united states federal  state and local  as well as international  tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations 
there can be no assurance that the company s tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the company would be successful in any such challenge 
the company s global operations are subject to a number of economic  political and regulatory risks 
the company conducts its operations in various regions of the world outside of the united states  including north america  south america  europe and asia pacific 
global economic and regulatory developments affect businesses such as the company s in many ways 
operations are subject to the effects of global competition 
particular local jurisdiction risks include regulatory risks arising from local laws 
the company s global operations are affected by local economic environments  including inflation  recession and currency volatility 
political changes  some of which may be disruptive  can interfere with the company s supply chain and customers and all of its activities in a particular location 
while some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some of these other risks may be insurable  such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful item b unresolved staff comments not applicable

first  the company reorganized its reportable segments effective the first quarter of fiscal and began reporting its financial information within the following five reportable segments healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical  healthcare supply chain services medical  clinical technologies and services  pharmaceutical technologies and services  and medical products manufacturing 
this change in segment reporting resulted from a realignment of the individual businesses to better correlate the operations of the company with the needs of its customers 
this change had no effect on the company s reported net earnings or net earnings per common share 
second  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company completed the sale of the pts business for approximately billion in cash 
the company used the after tax net proceeds of approximately billion to repurchase its common shares 
the company recognized an after tax book gain of approximately billion from this transaction 
the assets and liabilities of the pts business were classified as held for sale in prior periods and its operating results were classified within discontinued operations for all periods presented 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s discontinued operations 
the company s remaining four segments after the sale of the pts business align within two sectors the healthcare supply chain services sector  which includes the healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical and healthcare supply chain services medical segments  and the clinical and medical products sector  which includes the clinical technologies and services and medical products manufacturing segments 
the healthcare supply chain services sector focuses on delivering best in class distribution and logistics services to its customers 
the sector generates of total segment revenue  approximately three quarters of total segment profit as defined below in the segment results of operations section and consistent and reliable cash flow 
the clinical and medical products sector focuses largely on developing innovative products for hospitals and other providers of care 
the sector  with its higher margin products and services and faster growing segment profit has grown to contribute approximately one fourth of total segment profit 
third  during fiscal  the company acquired viasys  medmined and care fusion along with other acquisitions 
viasys is a leader in respiratory care through the development and marketing of systems for critical care and diagnostic use and offers products and services directed at critical care ventilation  respiratory diagnostics and clinical services  neurological  vascular  audio  homecare  orthopedics  sleep diagnostics and other medical and surgical products markets 
the value of the transaction  including the assumption of viasys s debt  totaled approximately billion 
viasys is being integrated into the medical products manufacturing segment 
the company also acquired medmined  a leader in tracking and predicting infection management opportunities within major hospitals and care fusion  which focuses on bedside bar code utilization for tracking hospital samples 
both businesses are being integrated into the clinical technologies and services segment

financial overview continued demand for the company s products and services in fiscal led to revenue of billion  up from fiscal operating earnings  which were negatively impacted by special items million  decreased to approximately billion 
the significant increase in special items related to reserves for litigation settlements million and in process research and development ipr d expenses primarily in connection with the viasys acquisition million 
the year over year operating earnings comparison was 
table of contents favorably impacted by increased gross margin million partially offset by increases in selling  general and administrative expenses million 
net earnings  which included the gain from the sale of the pts business billion  were billion and net diluted earnings per common share were 
fiscal cash from operating activities decreased million to billion primarily due to the payment of litigation settlement reserves and government fines million as discussed in the special items section below 
cash provided by investing activities was billion due primarily to net proceeds from the pts business divesture billion offset by cash paid for acquisitions billion 
cash used in financing activities was billion due to the company s cash payments for treasury shares billion offset by net proceeds from borrowings million and issuance of shares million 
during fiscal  the company repurchased approximately billion of its common shares under a billion repurchase authorization of which billion was settled prior to year end 
on august   the company announced a new billion share repurchase program which expires on august  see the table under item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for more information regarding the share repurchases 
also during fiscal  the company paid million in dividends or per share 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the board of directors raised the quarterly dividend by to per share 
the share repurchase activity apart from the use of net proceeds from the pts business divestiture and increased dividend payments support the company s previously stated long term goal to return of net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations to shareholders and to increase its dividend payout to of earnings per share

prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation 

table of contents equity based compensation expense was million  million and million  respectively  for the fiscal years ended june   and revenue revenue increased billion or during fiscal due to growth in each of the company s four reportable segments  including revenue growth of billion within the healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical segment  due primarily to growth in revenue from bulk customers billion 
the increase in revenue from bulk customers was due to certain existing customers deciding to purchase a greater volume of product from the company rather than directly from the manufacturer and to pharmaceutical price appreciation 
the company uses the internal metric pharmaceutical price appreciation index to evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical and consumer product price appreciation on revenue from the pharmaceutical supply chain business 
this metric is calculated using the change in the manufacturer s published price at the beginning of the period as compared to the end of the period weighted by the units sold by the pharmaceutical supply chain business during the period 
the pharmaceutical price appreciation index was during fiscal the healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical segment represents approximately of total segment revenue

provision for income taxes the provisions for income taxes relative to earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations were  and of pretax earnings in fiscal  and  respectively 
generally  fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within international and us state effective tax rates resulting from the company s business mix and changes in the tax impact of special items  which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item and the taxing jurisdiction 
the company s effective tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from increasing operations outside the united states  which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of 
the company has tax incentive agreements in several non us tax jurisdictions which will expire in fiscal years through if not renewed 
the company does not believe that potential changes from existing tax incentive agreements will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company s fiscal provision for income taxes relative to earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations was million and the effective tax rate was 
the fiscal effective tax rate benefited by percentage points from equity based compensation expense  which is deductible at a tax rate higher than the average tax rate 
the fiscal effective tax rate was adversely impacted by percentage points due to the non deductibility of certain special items and impairments  principally the ipr d charge related to the viasys acquisition 
with few exceptions  the company is no longer subject to us federal or non us income tax audits by tax authorities for fiscal years ending before june  the years subsequent to fiscal contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the amount and or timing of income  deductions and tax credits 
the internal revenue service irs currently has ongoing examinations of open years from through although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain  the company believes that adequate amounts of tax and interest have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result for these years 
while it is not currently possible to predict the impact of settlements or other irs 
table of contents audit activity on income tax expense or cash flows during the next months  the company does not expect any significant impact on financial position 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the effective tax rate from continuing operations was favorably impacted by a million adjustment to the tax reserves primarily due to the issuance of a final irs revenue agent report that related to fiscal years and during the second quarter of fiscal  the effective tax rate from continuing operations was negatively impacted by a million adjustment to the tax reserves related to an ongoing international tax audit 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company entered into an agreement with the irs to close the fiscal years through federal audits 
as a result  the company reversed tax reserves of approximately million 
the company s fiscal provision for income taxes relative to earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations was million and the effective tax rate was 
the fiscal effective tax rate was adversely impacted by percentage points due to the non deductibility of certain special items 
a provision of the american jobs creation act of ajca created a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate undistributed income earned abroad by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from non us subsidiaries 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that it would repatriate million of accumulated non us earnings in fiscal pursuant to the repatriation provisions of the ajca  and accordingly  the company recorded a related tax liability of million as of june  the million is the maximum repatriation available to the company under the repatriation provisions of the ajca 
during fiscal  the company repatriated million of qualifying accumulated foreign earnings in accordance with its plan adopted during fiscal an additional tax liability of million was recorded during fiscal due to new state legislation with respect to the ajca  bringing the company s total tax liability related to the repatriation recorded through june  to million 
uses of repatriated funds included domestic expenditures related to non executive salaries  capital asset investments and other permitted activities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
discontinued operations earnings from discontinued operations  net of tax increased by billion during fiscal primarily due to the after tax gain on the sale of the pts business billion and impairment charges from prior year million

the company evaluates the performance of the individual segments based upon  among other things  segment profit 
segment profit is segment revenue less segment cost of products sold  less segment sg a expenses 
segment sg a expense includes equity compensation expense as well as allocated corporate expenses for shared functions  including corporate management  corporate finance  financial shared services  human resources  information technology  legal and legislative affairs and the integrated sales organization

a portion of the corporate costs previously allocated to the former pharmaceutical technologies and services segment have been reclassified to the remaining four segments based upon each segment s respective 
table of contents proportion of allocated corporate expenses 
in addition  equity based compensation has been allocated to the segments based upon the forecasted equity based compensation expense for the respective segment plus one fourth of the forecasted corporate equity based compensation expense 
prior period information has been adjusted to reflect these changes in methodology 
equity based compensation expense was million  million and million  respectively  for the fiscal years ended june   and during the first quarter of fiscal  the healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical segment recorded a charge reflecting credits owed to certain vendors million for prior periods 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  an adjustment million was recorded to reduce a portion of the reserve based upon a revised estimate 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company revised the method used to allocate certain shared costs between the healthcare supply chain services medical segment and the medical products manufacturing segment to better align costs with the segment that receives the related benefits

healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical performance during fiscal  healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical segment revenue increased billion or primarily from revenue from bulk customers 
segment profit increased million due to revenue growth  increased generic pharmaceutical margin and increased distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation  offset by increased customer discounts and increased sg a expenses 
the pharmaceutical distribution market remains highly competitive and the company expects that customer discounts will continue to increase 
however  the company expects that increased manufacturer cash discounts and distribution service agreement fees  both of which increase with revenue growth  combined with increased generic margin and continued pharmaceutical price appreciation will enable the company to offset increased customer discounts 
the company s results could be adversely affected if sales of pharmaceutical products decline  the frequency of new generic pharmaceutical launches decreases or pharmaceutical price appreciation decreases from its historical rate 
alternatively  the company s results could benefit if sales of pharmaceutical products increase  the frequency of new generic pharmaceutical launches increases or pharmaceutical price appreciation exceeds its historical rate 
revenue from bulk customers  described below  increased billion during fiscal with additional volume from existing customers billion and new customers billion 
revenue from non bulk customers increased billion 
growth in revenue from non bulk customers was driven by additional sales volume from existing customers and pharmaceutical price appreciation billion 
the pharmaceutical price appreciation index was for fiscal acquisitions billion  mainly dohmen and parmed  also had a favorable impact on the year over year revenue comparison 
negatively impacting growth in revenue from non bulk customers was the loss of existing customers due to competition billion and the sale of a significant part of the specialty distribution business billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical segment profit increased million or in fiscal gross margin increased segment profit by million primarily due to the segment s revenue growth and increased generic pharmaceutical margin million due to new product launches and competitive vendor pricing 
gross margin also was favorably impacted by increased manufacturer cash discounts due to sales volume growth million and distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation combined impact of million 
gross margin was negatively impacted by increased customer discounts million due to increased sales volume and competitive pressures 
the company expects continued customer discounting due to the competitive market in which it operates 
increases in segment sg a expenses negatively impacted segment profit by approximately million for fiscal increases in sg a expenses were in support of the increased sales volume and due to the impact of acquisitions million 
favorably impacting sg a expenses was the reduction in equity based compensation expense million 
segment profit was negatively impacted by the prior year sale of a significant portion of the specialty distribution business million 
the company estimates that branded pharmaceuticals with industry wide sales volume domestically of billion and billion came off of patent protection during fiscal and  respectively  which allowed for generic pharmaceutical competition 
the company s estimate of industry wide branded pharmaceutical sales volume is internally developed using industry sales data for significant branded pharmaceuticals adapted for the company s fiscal period 
generic pharmaceuticals negatively impact revenue because they are offered at lower prices than branded pharmaceuticals  however  generic pharmaceuticals positively impact gross margin and operating earnings due to competitive vendor pricing 
the company generally earns the highest margins on generic pharmaceuticals during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product to the marketplace because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally deflationary 
the company expects a similar level of branded pharmaceuticals will come off of patent protection during fiscal compared with fiscal during fiscal  healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical segment revenue increased billion or 
revenue from bulk customers increased billion 
centralized warehouse and mail order customers contributed billion and billion  respectively  of the bulk customer revenue growth 
the additional sales volume was due in significant part to certain existing warehouse customers deciding to purchase from the company rather than directly from the manufacturer 
revenue from non bulk customers increased million based upon pharmaceutical price appreciation and additional sales volume from new and existing customers 
revenue growth was negatively impacted as a result of the decision of the specialty distribution business s largest customer to begin self distribution on january  and the sale of a significant portion of the specialty distribution business in the fourth quarter million 
the pharmaceutical price appreciation index was for fiscal healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical segment profit decreased million or in fiscal gross margin increased segment profit by million due primarily to the segment s revenue growth and increased manufacturer cash discounts million due to increased sales within the pharmaceutical supply chain business 
in addition  gross margin was favorably impacted by distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation combined impact of million 
other factors favorably impacting gross margin included generic pharmaceuticals million due to sales growth  competitive vendor pricing  the introduction of new generic pharmaceuticals within the pharmaceutical supply chain business  the addition of new vendors to the segment s national logistics center million and a last in  first out lifo reserve reduction million primarily due to price deflation within generic pharmaceutical inventories 
increased customer discounts within the pharmaceutical supply chain business negatively impacted segment profit by million due to increased sales volume and competitive pressures 
segment profit was also negatively impacted by an adjustment million  as described in detail below 
increases in segment sg a expenses negatively impacted segment profit by approximately million for fiscal compared to fiscal increases in these expenses were in support of the increased sales volume and increased equity based compensation expense million due primarily to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
as noted above  healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical segment profit was negatively impacted by an adjustment recorded in the first quarter of fiscal the company discovered it had inadvertently and 
table of contents erroneously failed to process credits owed to a vendor in prior years 
after a thorough review  the company determined it had failed to process similar credits for a limited number of additional vendors 
these processing failures  specific to a limited area of vendor credits  resulted from system programming  interface and data entry errors relating to these vendor credits which occurred over a period of years 
as a result  the company recorded a charge million in the first quarter of fiscal reflecting its estimate of the credits owed to these vendors 
bulk and non bulk customers 
the healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical segment differentiates between bulk and non bulk customers because bulk customers generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than non bulk customers 
bulk customers consist of customers centralized warehouse operations and customers mail order businesses 
all other customers are classified as non bulk customers for example  retail stores  pharmacies  hospitals and alternate care sites 
bulk customers include the warehouse operations of retail chains whose retail stores are classified as non bulk customers 
for example  a single retail chain pharmacy customer may be both a bulk customer with respect to its warehouse operations and a non bulk customer with respect to its retail stores 
bulk customers have the ability to process large quantities of products in central locations and self distribute these products to their individual retail stores or customers 
substantially all deliveries to bulk customers consist of product shipped in the same form as the product is received from the manufacturer  but a small portion of deliveries to bulk customers are broken down into smaller units prior to shipping 
non bulk customers  on the other hand  require more complex servicing by the company 
these services  all of which are performed by the company  include receiving inventory in large or full case quantities and breaking it down into smaller quantities  warehousing the product for a longer period of time  picking individual products specific to a customer s order and delivering that smaller order to a customer location 
the company tracks revenue by bulk and non bulk customers in its financial systems 
to assist the company in managing its business  an internal analysis has been prepared to allocate segment expenses total of segment cost of products sold and segment selling  general and administrative expenses separately for bulk and non bulk customers 
the following table shows the allocation of segment expenses  segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of revenue for bulk and non bulk customers for fiscal  and in millions non bulk customers revenue from non bulk customers segment expenses allocated to non bulk customers segment profit from non bulk customers segment profit from non bulk customers as a percentage of revenue from non bulk customers bulk customers revenue from bulk customers segment expenses allocated to bulk customers segment profit from bulk customers segment profit from bulk customers as a percentage of revenue from bulk customers amounts shown are estimates based upon the internal analysis described above 
the preparation of this internal analysis required the use of complex and subjective estimates and allocations based upon assumptions  past experience and judgment that the company believes are reasonable 
the core pharmaceutical distribution operation distribution within the healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical segment services both bulk and non bulk customers 
therefore  expenses associated with this operation were allocated between bulk and non bulk customers as described below 
the brokerage operation brokerage within the healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical segment only services bulk customers  therefore  expenses associated with brokerage are allocated to bulk customers 
the remaining operations ie excluding distribution and brokerage within the healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical segment service non bulk customers  therefore  expenses associated with these operations were allocated to non bulk customers 

table of contents the following describes the allocation of the major components of cost of products sold for distribution between bulk and non bulk customers cost of products sold for pharmaceutical products is determined by specifically tracking the manufacturer s designated price of products  at the time the products are sold  by bulk and non bulk customers 
the manufacturer s designated price is then reduced by other components impacting cost of products sold  including distribution service agreement fees  pharmaceutical price appreciation  manufacturer cash discounts and manufacturer rebates and incentives 
in addition  other inventory charges and credits are added or subtracted  as appropriate  to arrive at cost of products sold 
the company used the following methods that it believes provide a reasonable correlation to allocate the remaining components of cost of products sold between bulk and non bulk customers 
distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation are tracked by manufacturer 
therefore  the company allocated the distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation associated with each manufacturer among their products in proportion to sales of each product between bulk and non bulk customers 
manufacturer cash discounts are recognized as a reduction to cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold and were allocated in proportion to the manufacturer s published price of the product sold to bulk and non bulk customers 
manufacturers rebates and incentives are based on the individual agreements entered into with manufacturers related to specific products 
rebates and incentives were grouped by contract terms and then allocated in proportion to sales to bulk and non bulk customers 
other inventory charges and credits include charges for outdated and returned inventory items and fluctuation in inventory reserves 
the company estimated the portion of these inventory charges and credits attributable to each product and then allocated them to bulk and non bulk customers in proportion to the sales of these products 
the company used methods that it believes provide a reasonable correlation to allocate the selling  general and administrative expenses for distribution between bulk and non bulk customers as follows warehouse expense includes labor related expenses associated with receiving  shipping and handling the inventory as well as warehouse storage costs including insurance  taxes  supplies and other facility costs 
warehouse expense was allocated in proportion to the number of invoice line items filled for each bulk or non bulk customer because the company believes that there is a correlation between the number of different products ordered as reflected in invoice lines and the level of effort associated with receiving  shipping and handling that order bulk customers typically order larger quantities of products for each invoice line  delivery expense includes transportation costs associated with physically moving the product from the warehouse to the customer s designated location 
delivery expense was allocated in proportion to the number of invoices generated for each bulk or non bulk customer on the assumption that each invoice generates a delivery  sales expense includes personnel related costs associated with sales and customer service activities such activities are the same for both bulk and non bulk customers 
sales expense was allocated in proportion to the number of invoices generated for each bulk or non bulk customer because customer invoices are a reasonable estimate of the amount of customer service calls and sales effort  and general and administrative expenses were allocated in proportion to the units of products sold to bulk or non bulk customers 
these expenses were allocated on the assumption that general and administrative expenses increase or decrease in direct relation to the volume of sales 
amounts exclude lifo credit provisions of  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the internal analysis indicated segment expenses as a percentage of revenue were higher for bulk customers than for non bulk customers because of higher segment cost of products sold partially offset by lower segment sg a expenses 
bulk customers receive lower pricing on sales of the same products than non bulk customers due to volume pricing in a competitive market and the lower costs related to the services provided by the company 
in 
table of contents addition  sales to bulk customers in aggregate generate higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than sales to non bulk customers because bulk customers orders consist almost entirely of higher cost branded products 
the higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk customers is also driven by lower manufacturer distribution service agreement fees and branded pharmaceutical price appreciation and lower manufacturer cash discounts 
manufacturer distribution service agreement fees and manufacturer cash discounts are recognized as a reduction to segment cost of products sold and are lower as a percentage of revenue due to the mix of products sold 
pharmaceutical price appreciation increases customer pricing which  in turn  results in higher segment gross margin for sales of inventory that was on hand at the time of the manufacturer s price increase 
since products sold to bulk customers are generally held in inventory for a shorter time than products sold to non bulk customers  there is less opportunity to realize the benefit of pharmaceutical price appreciation 
consequently  segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk customers is higher than for non bulk customers and segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue is substantially lower for bulk customers than for non bulk customers 
deliveries to bulk customers require substantially less services by the company than deliveries to non bulk customers 
as such  the segment sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk customers are substantially lower than from non bulk customers 
these factors result in segment profit as a percentage of revenue being significantly lower for bulk customers than for non bulk customers 
the company defines bulk customers based on the way in which the company operates its business and the services it performs for its customers 
the company is not aware of an industry standard regarding the definition of bulk customers and based solely on a review of the annual reports on form k of other national pharmaceutical wholesalers  the company notes that other companies in comparable businesses may  or may not  use a different definition of bulk customers 
during fiscal  segment profit from bulk customers increased million  or of revenue from bulk customers  due to increased sales volume described above and the year over year increase in distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation 
segment profit for non bulk customers increased million  or of revenue from non bulk customers  compared to fiscal this increase in segment profit from non bulk customers was due primarily to the increase in sales volume described above and the impact of generic products which had a greater impact on the profitability of non bulk customers due to the mix of pharmaceuticals distributed to non bulk customers 
fiscal segment profit from bulk customers increased million  or of revenue from bulk customers  due to increased sales volume described above and the year over year impact of new distribution service agreements and pharmaceutical price appreciation 
the favorable impact of distribution service agreements and of pharmaceutical price appreciation had a greater impact on the profitability of bulk customers than on non bulk customers in fiscal due to the mix of branded pharmaceuticals distributed to bulk customers 
these positive factors were partially offset by an increase in allocated equity based compensation expense of million due to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
the fiscal segment profit for non bulk customers declined million  or of revenue from non bulk customers  compared to fiscal an increase in segment profit from non bulk customers due to increased sales and new distribution service agreements was offset by increased customer discounts  an increase in segment sg a expenses which was largely due to sales growth and an increase in allocated equity based compensation expense of million due to the adoption of sfas no 
r  and a million charge during the first quarter of fiscal reflecting credits owed to vendors

there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to successfully take advantage of any such opportunity if and when it arises or consummate any such transaction  if pursued 
if additional transactions are pursued or consummated  the company would incur additional acquisition integration charges  and may need to enter into funding arrangements for such acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful

pharmaceutical supply chain business model transition historically  a significant portion of the pharmaceutical supply chain business gross margin was derived from the company s ability to purchase pharmaceutical inventory  hold that inventory when a manufacturer increased prices  and sell that product at the higher price 
beginning in fiscal  branded pharmaceutical manufacturers began to seek greater control over the amount of product available in the supply chain and  as a result  began to change their sales practices by restricting the volume of product available for purchase by wholesalers 
in addition  manufacturers sought additional services from the company  including providing data concerning product sales and distribution patterns 
the company believes that manufacturers sought these changes to provide them with greater visibility over product demand and movement in the market and to increase product safety and integrity by reducing the risks associated with product being available to  and distributed in  the secondary market 
these changes significantly reduced the pharmaceutical price appreciation earned by the company 

table of contents in response to these developments  the company established a compensation system with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers that is significantly less dependent on manufacturers pricing practices  and is based on the services provided by the company to meet the unique distribution requirements of each manufacturer s products 
during fiscal  the company worked with individual branded pharmaceutical manufacturers to define fee for service terms that compensate the company based on the services being provided to such manufacturers 
this transition was completed during fiscal these new arrangements have moderated the seasonality of earnings which have historically reflected the pattern of manufacturers price increases 
under the fee for service arrangements  reflected in written distribution service agreements  the company s compensation for these services may be a fee or a fee plus pharmaceutical price appreciation 
in certain instances  the company must achieve certain performance criteria to receive the maximum fees under the agreement 
the fee is typically a fixed percentage of either the company s purchases from the manufacturer or the company s sales of the manufacturer s products to its customers 
the company continues to generate gross margin from the sale of some manufacturers products from pharmaceutical price appreciation without receiving distribution service agreement fees 
if the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price appreciation slows  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
distribution service agreements between the company and certain branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally range from a one year term with an automatic renewal feature to a five year term 
these agreements generally cannot be terminated unless mutually agreed by the parties  a breach of the agreement occurs that is not cured  or a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency event occurs 
some agreements allow the manufacturer to terminate the agreement without cause within a defined notice period 
critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are amounts owed to the company through its operating activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company also provides financing to various customers 
such financing arrangements range from ninety days to ten years at interest rates that generally are subject to fluctuation 
these financings may be collateralized  guaranteed by third parties or unsecured 
finance notes and accrued interest receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and are included in other assets 
extending credit terms and calculating the required allowance for doubtful accounts involve the use of judgment by the company s management 
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  which includes portfolio and specific reserves  the company reviews accounts receivable aging  industry trends  customer financial strength  credit standing  historical write off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection 
the company continuously monitors the collectibility of its receivable portfolio by analyzing the aging of its accounts receivable  assessing credit worthiness of its customers and evaluating the impact of changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks 
if the frequency or severity of customer defaults change due to changes in customers financial condition or general economic conditions  the company s allowance for doubtful accounts may require adjustment 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at june  and  respectively 
this allowance represented and of customer receivables at june  and  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue was  and at june   and  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by million  
table of contents million and million in fiscal   and  respectively  for customer deductions and write offs and was increased by additional provisions of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables and sales type leases to the reserve at june  would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of approximately million 
reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic  business and market trends 
in addition  reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present 
the company believes the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed 
at this time  the company is not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant future increase in the company s allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue 
see schedule ii included in this form k which includes a rollforward of activity for these allowance reserves 
inventories a substantial portion of inventories approximately and at june  and  respectively are stated at the lower of cost  using the lifo method  or market 
these inventories are included within the core distribution facilities within the company s healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical segment core distribution facilities and are primarily merchandise inventories 
the lifo impact on the consolidated statement of earnings in a given year is dependent on pharmaceutical price appreciation and the level of inventory 
prices for branded pharmaceuticals are primarily inflationary  which results in an increase in cost of products sold  whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals are deflationary  which results in a decrease in cost of products sold 
under the lifo method  it is assumed that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold 
as such  the company uses lifo to better match current costs and revenue 
therefore  reductions in the overall inventory levels resulting from declining branded pharmaceutical inventory levels generally will result in a decrease in future cost of products sold  as the remaining inventory will be held at a lower cost due to the inflationary environment 
conversely  reductions in the overall inventory levels created by declining generic pharmaceutical inventory levels would generally increase future cost of products sold  as the remaining inventory will be held at a higher cost due to the deflationary environment 
the company believes that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within the core distribution facilities 
as such  the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 
in fiscal  the company did not record any lifo reserve reductions 
the lifo reserve reduction in fiscal of million was primarily due to price deflation within generic pharmaceutical inventories 
the remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
if the company had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the core distribution facilities  inventories would not have changed in fiscal or fiscal in fact  primarily due to continued deflation in generic pharmaceutical inventories  inventories at lifo were million and million higher than the average cost value as of june  and  respectively 
however  the company s policy is not to record inventories in excess of its current market value 
inventories recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were million and million at june  and  respectively 
the company reserves for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experiences  sales trends  specific categories of inventory and age of on hand inventory 
if actual conditions are less favorable than the company s assumptions  additional inventory reserves may be required  however these would not be expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
business combinations assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets which require management to use significant judgment in determining fair value 
the company typically utilizes third party valuation experts for this process 
in addition  current and future amortization expense 
table of contents for such intangibles is impacted by purchase price allocations as well as the assessment of estimated useful lives of such intangibles  excluding goodwill 
the company believes the assets recorded and the useful lives established are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 
in conjunction with the review of a transaction  the valuation experts assess the status of the acquired company s research and development projects to determine the existence of ipr d 
in connection with the acquisitions of viasys and care fusion  the company was required to estimate the fair value of acquired ipr d which required selecting an appropriate discount rate and estimating future cash flows for each project 
management also assessed the current status of development  nature and timing of efforts to complete such development  uncertainties and other factors when estimating the fair value 
costs were not assigned to ipr d unless future development was probable 
once the fair value was determined  an asset was established  and in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method  was immediately written off as a special item in the company s consolidated statement of earnings 
the company recorded million and million as a special item in fiscal representing an estimate of viasys s and care fusion s acquired ipr d  respectively see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangibles the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist 
intangible assets with finite lives  primarily customer relationships and patents and trademarks  continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
in conducting the impairment test  the fair value of the company s reporting units is compared to its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  then no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  further analysis is performed to assess impairment 
the company s determination of fair value of the reporting units is based on a discounted cash flow analysis or a review of the price earnings ratio for publicly traded companies similar in nature  scope and size 
the methods and assumptions used to test impairment have been revised for the segment realignment for the periods presented 
the discount rate used for impairment testing is based on the risk free rate plus an adjustment for risk factors 
the use of alternative estimates  peer groups or changes in the industry  or adjusting the discount rate used could affect the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in impairment 
any identified impairment would result in an adjustment to the company s results of operations 
the company performed its annual impairment tests in fiscal and  neither of which resulted in the recognition of any impairment charges 
decreasing the price earnings ratio of competitors used for impairment testing by one point or increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis used for impairment testing by would not have indicated impairment for any of the company s reporting units for fiscal or see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangibles 
special items the company records restructuring charges  acquisition integration charges and certain litigation and other items as special items 
a restructuring activity is a program whereby the company fundamentally changes its operations such as closing facilities  moving a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product 
restructuring activities may also involve substantial re alignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions 
restructuring charges are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
under this statement  a liability is measured at its fair value and recognized as incurred 
acquisition integration charges include costs to integrate acquired companies 
upon acquisition  certain integration charges are included within the purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and other integration charges are recorded as special items as incurred 

table of contents certain litigation recorded in special items consists of settlements of significant lawsuits that are infrequent  non recurring or unusual in nature 
the company also classified legal fees and document preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the sec investigation and the audit committee internal review and related matters as special items 
the majority of the special items related to acquisition integration and restructurings can be classified in one of the following categories employee related costs  exit costs including lease termination costs  asset impairments and other integration costs 
employee costs include severance and termination benefits 
lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees  forfeited deposits and remaining payments due under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income 
other facility exit costs include costs to move equipment or inventory out of a facility as well as other costs incurred to shut down a facility 
asset impairment costs include the reduction in value of the company s assets as a result of the integration or restructuring activities 
other integration costs primarily include charges directly related to the integration plan such as consulting costs related to information systems and employee benefit plans as well as relocation and travel costs directly associated with the integration plan 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
vendor reserves the company maintains reserves to cover areas of exposure with its vendors 
in determining appropriate vendor reserves  the company assesses historical experience and current outstanding claims 
the company has established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review 
the company researches and resolves various types of contested transactions based on discussions with vendors  company policy and findings of research performed 
though the transaction types are relatively consistent  the company has periodically refined its estimate methodology over the past few years by updating the reserve estimate percentages based upon historical experiences 
changes to the estimate percentages have resulted in a financial impact to the company s cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made 
vendor reserves were million and million at june  and  respectively 
approximately and of the vendor reserve at june  and  respectively  pertained to the healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical segment 
fluctuations in the reserve balance are caused by the variations of outstanding claims from period to period  timing of settlements and specific vendor issues  such as bankruptcies significant events would be described above in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
though vendor transactions remain relatively consistent from period to period  unforeseen events such as the deterioration in the financial condition of a large vendor or a settlement of numerous outstanding claims could cause the reserve to fluctuate  and thus  have a financial impact on the period s financial results 
at any given time  there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution 
the ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than the company s original estimate and may require adjustment 
however  the company believes reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 
self insurance accruals the company is self insured for employee medical and dental insurance programs 
the company had recorded liabilities totaling million and million for estimated costs related to outstanding claims at june  and  respectively 
these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims  administrative fees and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on the company s assessment of outstanding claims  historical analysis and current payment trends 
the company records an estimate for the claims incurred but not reported using an estimated lag period 
this lag period assumption has been consistently applied for the periods presented 
if the lag period was hypothetically adjusted by a period equal to a half month  the impact on earnings would be million 
if the amount of claims  medical or dental costs increase beyond what was estimated  the reserve might not be sufficient and additional expense could be required 
however  the company believes the liabilities recorded are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 

table of contents medical and dental insurance expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary  the company has certain deductibles or is self insured for various risks including general liability  product liability  pharmacist professional liability  auto liability  property and workers compensation 
however  claims in excess of certain limits are insured with commercial insurers 
the company had recorded liabilities totaling million and million for anticipated costs related to liability  property and workers compensation at june  and  respectively 
these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims  defense costs  claims adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
for certain types of exposures the company uses third parties to assist in developing the estimate of expected ultimate costs to settle each claim which is based on specific information related to each claim 
for claims incurred but not reported the liabilities are calculated by outside actuaries and are derived in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices 
the amount of ultimate liability in respect to these matters is dependent on future contingent events that cannot be predicted with certainty and may differ from these estimates 
although the company believes that liability estimates are appropriate based on information available at june   it is possible  based on generally accepted actuarial analysis  that under adverse conditions the ultimate liability could exceed recorded expected liabilities as of june  by as much as million 
the insurance expense for general liability  product liability  pharmacist professional liability  auto liability  property and workers compensation was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
provision for income taxes the company s income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax reserves reflect management s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards for tax purposes 
the company had net deferred income tax assets of million and million at june  and  respectively 
the company also had net deferred income tax liabilities of billion at june  and net deferred income tax assets included net federal  state and local  and international loss and credit carry forwards at june  and of million and million  respectively 
the company established a net valuation allowance of million and million at june  and  respectively  against certain deferred tax assets  which primarily relates to federal and state loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain 
the company established a million valuation allowance in fiscal related to capital loss carryforwards resulting from the pts business divestiture for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain 
expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually 
after application of the valuation allowances described above  the company anticipates no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 
in addition  the company has established an estimated liability for federal  state and non us income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the company prepares and files tax returns based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations and records estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  the company s tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
the company has developed a methodology for estimating its tax liability related to such matters and has consistently followed such methodology from period to period 
the liability amounts for such matters are based on an evaluation of the underlying facts and circumstances  a thorough research of the technical merits of the company s arguments and an assessment of the probability of the company prevailing in its arguments 
in all cases  the company considers previous findings of the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities 
the company generally consults with external tax advisers in reaching its conclusions 
amounts accrued for a particular period are adjusted when a significant change in facts or circumstances has occurred 

table of contents the company believes that its estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
however  other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 
in addition to income mix from geographical regions  the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year 
although not material to the effective tax rate for the three fiscal years ended june   if any of the company s assumptions or estimates were to change  an increase decrease in the company s effective tax rate by on earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations would have caused income tax expense to increase decrease by million for the fiscal year ended june  in the first quarter of fiscal  the company is required to adopt the provisions of fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard also provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
this interpretation also provides guidance on measurement  derecognizing  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the company is currently assessing the impact of fin no 
on its consolidated financial statements 
loss contingencies the company accrues for contingencies related to litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires the company to assess contingencies to determine degree of probability and range of possible settlement 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued in the company s consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the settlement can be reasonably estimated 
assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 
the company regularly reviews contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures 
the amount of ultimate settlement may differ from these estimates 
equity based compensation during the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  applying the modified prospective method 
this statement requires all equity based payments to employees  including grants of options  to be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the fair values of options granted after the company adopted this statement were determined using a lattice valuation model and all options granted prior to adoption of this statement were valued using a black scholes model 
the company s estimate of an option s fair value is dependent on a complex estimation process that requires the estimation of future uncertain events 
these estimates which are entered within the option valuation model include  but are not limited to  stock price volatility  the expected option life  expected dividend yield and option forfeiture rates 
effective with all options granted subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company estimates its future stock price volatility based on implied volatility from traded options on the company s common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant years 
the company analyzed historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to estimate the expected option life and forfeiture rates 
the company calculated separate option valuations for three separate groups of employees with similar historical exercise behaviors 
once employee stock option values are determined  current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed  even if the estimates used in the valuation model are different from actual results 
however  sfas no 
r requires the company to compare its estimated option forfeiture rates to actual forfeiture rates and record any adjustments as necessary
