this  combined with organic growth from the influx of new client assets  resulted in a billion increase in average deposit balances 
this increase in average deposit balances provided the funding for the billion increase in average loan balances 
this increase was purchased residential mortgage pools and corporate loans  of which are purchased interests in corporate loan syndications with the remainder originated by rjbank 
as a result of this growth  rjbank net interest income increased to million 
due to robust loan growth  the associated allowance for loan losses that are established upon recording a new loan and making new unfunded commitments required a provision of over million in accordingly  rjbank s pre tax income increased only 
during periods of growth when new loans are originated or purchased  an allowance for loan losses is established for potential losses inherent in those new loans 
accordingly  a robust period of growth generally results in charges to earnings in that period  while the benefits of higher interest earnings are realized in later periods 
year ended september  compared with the year ended september  rjbank assets at rjbank grew a substantial billion during the year 
the increase was driven by a billion increase in deposits  billion of which were redirected from the company s heritage cash trust or customer brokerage accounts  representing the introduction of a new sweep program for certain brokerage accounts

the company intends to expand this offering over the next several years  transferring an additional to billion

the decline in interest spreads is due to the growth in the deposit balances from two bulk transfers of client deposits of billion each to rjbank  which were then invested over time 
this process left significant cash balances invested at low rates until the cash could be deployed and used to purchase loans  depressing overall interest spreads 
rjbank has gone through a period of rapid loan growth and accordingly established allowances for loan losses for potential losses inherent in the loan portfolios 
these charges to earnings have a negative impact on returns during periods of loan growth 
increases and decreases in operating interest income and operating interest expense result from changes in average balances volume of interest earning banking assets and liabilities  as well as changes in average interest rates 
the following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on rjbank s interest earning assets and the interest incurred on its interest bearing liabilities 
the effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous year s average yield cost

it requires that minimum net capital  as defined  be equal to the greater of  or two percent of aggregate debit items arising from client transactions 
finra may require a member firm to reduce its business if its net capital is less than four percent of aggregate debit items and may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business and declaring cash dividends if its net capital is less than five percent of aggregate debit items

failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  rjbank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of rjbank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
rjbank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require rjbank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined 
management believes  as of september   that the bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the following is a summary of the company s critical accounting policies 
for a full description of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
these critical accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgments based upon available information 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  understanding these policies is important in understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of the company 
valuation of securities and other assets trading instruments and available for sale securities are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income  depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument 
the following table presents the company s trading instruments and available for sale securities segregated into trading securities ie  non derivative  derivative contracts  and available for sale securities september  financial instruments owned at fair value financial instruments sold but not yet purchased at fair value in s trading securities derivative contracts available for sale securities total trading securities  available for sale securities and derivative contracts when available  the company uses prices from independent sources such as listed market prices  or broker or dealer price quotations to derive the fair value of the instruments 
for investments in illiquid  privately held or other securities that do not have readily determinable fair values  the company uses estimated fair values as determined by management 
fair values for derivative contracts are obtained from pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
the following table presents the carrying value of trading securities  available for sale securities  and derivative contracts for which fair value is measured based on quoted prices or other independent sources versus those for which fair value is determined by management september  financial instruments owned at fair value financial instruments sold but not yet purchased at fair value in s fair value based on quoted prices and independent sources fair value determined by management total investment in leveraged leases the company is the lessor in a leveraged commercial aircraft transaction with continental 
the company s ability to realize its expected return is dependent upon this airline s ability to fulfill its lease obligation 
in the event that this airline defaults on its lease commitment and the trustee for the debt holders is unable to re lease or sell the plane with adequate terms  the company would suffer a loss of some or all of its investment 
the value of the company s leveraged lease with continental was approximately million as of september  the company s equity investment represented of the aggregate purchase price  the remaining was funded by public debt issued in the form of equipment trust certificates 
the residual value of the aircraft at the end of the lease term of approximately years is projected to be of the original cost 
this lease expires in may although continental remains current on its lease payments to the company  the inability of continental to make its lease payments  or the termination or modification of the lease through a bankruptcy proceeding  could result in the write down of the company s investment and the acceleration of certain income tax payments 
the company continues to monitor this lessee for specific events or circumstances that would increase the likelihood of a default on continental s obligations under this lease 
the company was also the lessor in a leveraged commercial aircraft transaction with delta 
delta filed for bankruptcy protection on september  accordingly  the company recorded a million pre tax charge in to fully reserve the balance of its investment in the leveraged lease of an aircraft to delta 
the company had taken a million pre tax charge in to partially reserve for this investment 
no amount of these charges represented a cash expenditure 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company sold its interest in the delta transaction for million  which was recognized as a pre tax gain within other revenue 
upon closing  certain income tax obligations of approximately million were accelerated and paid during the quarter 
these tax payments did not impact net earnings  as these amounts were previously recorded as deferred tax liabilities 
goodwill goodwill is related to the acquisitions of roney co 
now part of rja and goepel mcdermid  inc now called raymond james ltd this goodwill  totaling million  was allocated to the reporting units within the private client group and capital markets segments pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
in accordance with this pronouncement  indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized 
rather  they are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment 
this test involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities  identified intangible assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount  a further test is required to measure the amount of the impairment 
when available  the company uses recent  comparable transactions to estimate the fair value of the respective reporting units 
the company calculates an estimated fair value based on multiples of revenues  earnings  and book value of comparable transactions 
however  when such comparable transactions are not available or have become outdated  the company uses discounted cash flow scenarios to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
as of september   goodwill had been allocated to the private client group of rja  and both the private client group and capital markets segments of raymond james limited rj ltd 
as of the most recent impairment test  the company determined that the carrying value of the goodwill for each reporting unit had not been impaired 
however  changes in current circumstances or business conditions could result in an impairment of goodwill 
as required  the company will continue to perform impairment testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
reserves the company recognizes liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that  when fully analyzed  indicates it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
when a range of probable loss can be estimated  the company accrues the most likely amount  if not determinable  the company accrues at least the minimum of the range of probable loss 
the company records reserves related to legal proceedings in trade and other payables 
such reserves are established and maintained in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and financial interpretation no 
 reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management 
management considers many factors including  but not limited to the amount of the claim  the amount of the loss in the client s account  the basis and validity of the claim  the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of an employee of the company  previous results in similar cases  and legal precedents and case law 
each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management 
lastly  each case is reviewed to determine if it is probable that insurance coverage will apply  in which case the reserve is reduced accordingly 
any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge credit to earnings in that period 
the company also records reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related to client receivables and loans 
client receivables at the broker dealers are generally collateralized by securities owned by the brokerage clients 
therefore  when a receivable is considered to be impaired  the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities acting as collateral  which is measured based on current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker dealer price quotations 
client loans at rjbank are generally collateralized by real estate or other property 
rjbank provides for both an allowance for losses in accordance with sfas no 
and a reserve for individually impaired loans in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by a creditor for impairment of a loan 
the calculation of the sfas no 
allowance is subjective as management segregates the loan portfolio into different homogeneous classes and assigns each class an allowance percentage based on the perceived risk associated with that class of loans 
during the fiscal year  rjbank re evaluated and implemented changes to the loan loss reserve methodology in conjunction with a revision to the corporate loan grading process 
the new loan grading process was revised and expanded to provide more specific and detailed risk measurement across the corporate loan portfolio 
the factors taken into consideration when assigning the reserve percentage to each reserve category include estimates of borrower default probabilities and collateral values  trends in delinquencies  volume and terms  changes in geographic distribution  lending policies  local  regional  and national economic conditions  concentrations of credit risk and past loss history 
in addition  the company provides for potential losses inherent in rjbank s unfunded lending commitments using the criteria above  further adjusted for an estimated probability of funding 
for individual loans identified as impaired  rjbank measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
at september   the amortized cost of all rjbank loans was billion and an allowance for loan losses of million was recorded against that balance 
the total allowance for loan losses  including million in reserves for off balance sheet exposures maintained in trade and other payables  is equal to of the amortized cost of the loan portfolio 
the following table allocates rjbank s allowance for loan losses by loan category september  september  september  september  september  in s commercial loans allowance total commercial loans as a of loans receivable real estate construction loans allowance total real estate construction loans as a of loans receivable commercial real estate loans allowance total commercial real estate loans as a of loans receivable residential mortgage loans allowance total residential mortgage loans as a of loans receivable consumer loans allowance total consumer loans as a of loans receivable total allowance of total loans receivable the company also makes loans or pays advances to financial advisors  primarily for recruiting and retention purposes 
the company provides for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an evaluation of the company s ability to collect such receivables 
the company s ongoing evaluation includes the review of specific accounts of financial advisors no longer associated with the company and the company s historical collection experience 
at september  the receivable from financial advisors was million  which is net of an allowance of million for estimated uncollectibility 
income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management risks are an inherent part of the company s business and activities 
management of these risks is critical to the company s fiscal soundness and profitability 
risk management at the company is a multi faceted process that requires communication  judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets 
the company s senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment  monitoring and control of various risks 
the principal risks involved in the company s business activities are market  credit  operational  and regulatory and legal 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss to the company resulting from changes in interest rates and equity prices 
the company has exposure to market risk primarily through its broker dealer and banking operations 
the company s broker dealer subsidiaries  primarily rja  trade tax exempt and taxable debt obligations and act as an active market maker in approximately over the counter equity securities 
in connection with these activities  the company maintains inventories in order to ensure availability of securities and to facilitate client transactions 
additionally  the company  primarily within its canadian broker dealer subsidiary  invests for its own proprietary equity investment account 
the following table represents the fair value of trading instruments associated with the company s broker dealer client facilitation  market making activities and proprietary trading activities september  september  instruments instruments sold but sold but trading not yet trading not yet instruments purchased instruments purchased in s marketable municipal corporate government agency total debt securities derivative contracts equity securities other securities total changes in value of the company s trading inventory may result from fluctuations in interest rates  credit ratings of the issuer  equity prices and the correlation among these factors 
the company manages its trading inventory by product type and has established trading divisions that have responsibility for each product type 
the company s primary method of controlling risk in its trading inventory is through the establishment and monitoring of limits on the dollar amount of securities positions that can be entered into and other risk based limits  limits are established both for categories of securities eg  otc equities  corporate bonds  municipal bonds and for individual traders 
as of september   the absolute fixed income and equity inventory limits were  and  respectively 
the company s trading activities were well within these limits at september  position limits in trading inventory accounts are monitored on a daily basis 
consolidated position and exposure reports are prepared and distributed to senior management 
limit violations are carefully monitored 
management also monitors inventory levels and trading results  as well as inventory aging  pricing  concentration and securities ratings 
for derivatives  primarily interest rate swaps  the company monitors exposure in its derivatives subsidiary daily based on established limits with respect to a number of factors  including interest rate  spread  ratio  basis  and volatility risk 
these exposures are monitored both on a total portfolio basis and separately for selected maturity periods 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of maintaining trading inventories of fixed income instruments and actively manages this risk using hedging techniques that involve swaps  futures  and us treasury obligations 
the company monitors  on a daily basis  the value at risk var in its institutional fixed income trading portfolios cash instruments and interest rate derivatives 
var is an appropriate statistical technique for estimating the potential loss in trading portfolios due to typical adverse market movements over a specified time horizon with a suitable confidence level 
to calculate var  the company uses historical simulation 
this approach assumes that historical changes in market conditions are representative of future changes 
the simulation is based upon daily market data for the previous twelve months 
var is reported at a confidence level  based on a one day time horizon 
this means that the company could expect to incur losses greater than those predicted by the var estimates only once in every trading days  or about times a year 
during the fiscal year ended september   the reported daily loss in the institutional fixed income trading portfolio exceeded the predicted var five times  due in part  to volatile movements in bond prices experienced during the fourth fiscal quarter 
however  trading losses on a single day could exceed the reported var by significant amounts in unusually volatile markets and might accumulate over a longer time horizon  such as a number of consecutive trading days 
accordingly  management employs additional interest rate risk controls including position limits  a daily review of trading results  review of the status of aged inventory  independent controls on pricing  monitoring of concentration risk  and review of issuer ratings 
the following tables set forth the high  low  and daily average var for the company s overall institutional portfolio during the twelve months ended september   with the corresponding dollar value of the company s portfolio twelve months ended september  var at september  september  high low dailyaverage in s daily var related portfolio value net var as a percent of portfolio value portfolio value achieved on the day of the var calculation 
the modeling of the risk characteristics of trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
while management believes that its assumptions and approximations are reasonable  there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating var  and different assumptions or approximations could produce materially different var estimates 
as a result  var statistics are more reliable when used as indicators of risk levels and trends within a firm than as a basis for inferring differences in risk taking across firms 
additional information is discussed under derivative financial instruments in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
rjbank maintains an earning asset portfolio that is comprised of mortgage  corporate and consumer loans  as well as mortgage backed securities  securities purchased under resale agreements  and other investments 
those earning assets are funded in part by its obligations to clients  including now accounts  demand deposits  money market accounts  savings accounts  and certificates of deposit  and fhlb advances 
based on the current earning asset portfolio of rjbank  market risk for rjbank is limited primarily to interest rate risk 
rjbank analyzes interest rate risk based on forecasted net interest income  which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid  and the net portfolio valuation  both in a range of interest rate scenarios 
the following table represents the carrying value of rjbank s assets and liabilities that are subject to market risk 
this table does not include financial instruments with limited market risk exposure due to offsetting asset and liability positions  short holding periods or short periods of time until the interest rate resets 
rjbank financial instruments with market risk as described above september  september  in s mortgage backed securities loans receivable  net total assets with market risk certificates of deposit federal home loan bank advances total liabilities with market risk the following table shows the distribution of those rjbank loans that mature in more than one year between fixed and adjustable interest rate loans at september  interest rate type fixed adjustable total in s commercial loans real estate construction loans commercial real estate loans residential mortgage loans consumer loans total loans one of the core objectives of rjbank s asset liability management committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
the asset liability management committee uses several measures to monitor and limit rjbank s interest rate risk including scenario analysis  interest repricing gap analysis and limits  and net portfolio value limits 
simulation models and estimation techniques are used to assess the sensitivity of the net interest income stream to movements in interest rates 
assumptions about consumer behavior play an important role in these calculations  this is particularly relevant for loans such as mortgages where the client has the right  but not the obligation  to repay before the scheduled maturity 
the sensitivity of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated for a variety of scenarios 
assuming an immediate and lasting shift of basis points in the term structure of interest rates  rjbank s sensitivity analysis indicates that an upward movement would decrease rjbank s net interest income by in the first year after the rate increase  whereas a downward shift of the same magnitude would increase rjbank s net interest income by 
these sensitivity figures are based on positions as of september   and are subject to certain simplifying assumptions  including that management takes no corrective action 
equity price risk the company is exposed to equity price risk as a consequence of making markets in equity securities and the investment activities of rja and rj ltd 
the us broker dealer activities are primarily client driven  with the objective of meeting clients needs while earning a trading profit to compensate for the risk associated with carrying inventory 
the company attempts to reduce the risk of loss inherent in its inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions constantly throughout each day and establishing position limits 
the company s canadian broker dealer has a proprietary trading business with traders 
the average aggregate inventory held for proprietary trading during the year ended september  was cdn  the company s equity securities inventories are priced on a regular basis and there are no material unrecorded gains or losses 
credit risk the company is engaged in various trading and brokerage activities whose counterparties primarily include broker dealers  banks and other financial institutions 
the company is exposed to risk that these counterparties may not fulfill their obligations 
the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty and or the issuer of the instrument 
the company manages this risk by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty  conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties  reviewing security and loan concentrations  holding and marking to market collateral on certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations  which guarantee performance 
the company s client activities involve the execution  settlement  and financing of various transactions on behalf of its clients 
client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis 
credit exposure associated with the company s private client group results primarily from customer margin accounts  which are monitored daily and are collateralized 
when clients execute a purchase the company is at some risk that the client will renege on the trade 
if this occurs  the company may have to liquidate the position at a loss 
however  most private clients have available funds in the account before the trade is executed 
the company monitors exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and performs analysis on a regular basis in connection with its margin lending activities 
the company adjusts its margin requirements if it believes its risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
in addition  rjbank offers a variety of loan products including residential mortgage  commercial real estate  and consumer loans  which are collateralized  and corporate loans for which the borrower is carefully evaluated and monitored 
rjbank s policy is to require customers to provide such collateral prior to the disbursement of approved loans 
the amount of collateral obtained  if it is deemed necessary by rjbank upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  residential real estate  and income producing commercial properties 
when using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates  rjbank exposes itself to credit risk with those counterparties also 
rjbank minimizes the credit or repayment risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions only with high quality counterparties whose credit rating is investment grade 
the company is subject to concentration risk if it holds large positions  extends large loans to  or has large commitments with a single counterparty  borrower  or group of similar counterparties or borrowers eg in the same industry 
securities purchased under agreements to resell consist entirely of securities issued by the us government or its agencies 
receivables from and payables to clients and stock borrow and lending activities are conducted with a large number of clients and counterparties and potential concentration is carefully monitored 
inventory and investment positions taken and commitments made  including underwritings  may involve exposure to individual issuers and businesses 
the company seeks to limit this risk through careful review of the underlying business and the use of limits established by senior management  taking into consideration factors including the financial strength of the counterparty  the size of the position or commitment  the expected duration of the position or commitment and other positions or commitments outstanding 
the company is the lessor in a leveraged commercial aircraft transaction with continental 
the company s ability to realize its expected return is dependent upon the airline s ability to fulfill its lease obligation 
in the event that the airline defaults on its lease commitments and the trustee for the debt holders is unable to re lease or sell the plane with adequate terms  the company would suffer a loss of some or all of its investment 
although continental remains current on its lease payments to the company  the inability of continental to make its lease payments  or the termination or modification of the lease through a bankruptcy proceeding  could result in the write down of the company s investment and the acceleration of certain income tax payments 
the company continues to monitor this lessee for specific events or circumstances that would increase the likelihood of a default on continental s obligations under this lease 
operational risk operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including  but not limited to  business disruptions  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in the company s technology or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in the company s control processes 
the company operates different businesses in diverse markets and is reliant on the ability of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions 
these risks are less direct than credit and market risk  but managing them is critical  particularly in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volumes 
in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees  the company could suffer financial loss  regulatory sanctions and damage to its reputation 
in order to mitigate and control operational risk  the company has developed and continues to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout the organization and within such departments as accounting  operations  information technology  legal  compliance and internal audit 
these control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that the company s various businesses are operating within established corporate policies and limits 
business continuity plans exist for critical systems  and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate 
a compliance and standards committee comprised of senior executives meets monthly to consider policy issues 
the committee reviews material customer complaints and litigation  as well as issues in operating departments  for the purpose of identifying issues that present risk exposure to customers or to the company 
the committee adopts policies to deal with these issues  which are then disseminated throughout the company 
the company has established a quality of markets committee that meets regularly to monitor the best execution activities of the trading departments within the company as they relate to customer orders 
this committee is comprised of representatives from the otc trading  listed trading  options  municipal trading  taxable trading  compliance and legal departments and is under the direction of a senior officer of the company
