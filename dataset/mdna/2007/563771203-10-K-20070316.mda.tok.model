item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial position and our results of operations for each of the three years ended december    and this discussion should be read in conjunction with item consolidated financial statements and related notes  beginning on page f of this report and with other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
unless stated otherwise  all financial information presented below  throughout this report  and in the consolidated financial statements and related notes includes mannatech and all of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
company overview since november  we have developed innovative  high quality  proprietary nutritional supplements  topical and skin care products  and weight management products that are sold through a global network marketing system operating in the united states  canada  australia  the united kingdom  japan  new zealand  the republic of korea  taiwan  denmark  and germany 
new zealand is serviced by our australian subsidiary and denmark and germany are serviced by our united kingdom subsidiary 
our australian and united kingdom subsidiaries each operate as limited risk service providers for the united states parent 
the united states parent owns all of the sales and inventories and accrues all commissions and cost of sales in new zealand  australia  the united kingdom  denmark  and germany 
the united states parent pays the limited risk service providers a management fee for processing and shipping orders in australia  new zealand  the united kingdom  denmark  and germany 
we operate as a single segment and primarily sell our products through a network of approximately  independent associates and members who have purchased our products and or packs within the last months  which we refer to as current independent associates and members 
we operate as a seller of nutritional supplements through our network marketing distribution channels operating in ten different countries 
we review and analyze our net sales by geographical location and further analyze our net sales by packs and by products 
each of our subsidiaries sells the same type of products and possesses similar economic characteristics  such as selling prices and gross margins 
for the year ended december   our net sales  net income and diluted earnings per share increased  however  the increase in the number of new independent associates and members has slowed as compared to the percentage increases in the prior year 
in  we plan to expand into additional countries  launch new products  and continue to register our products in all countries in which we operate 
in april  we plan to substantially complete phase ii of our internally developed software system  which will fully interface all countries with operations and financial databases 
in order to implement the new system  we will have to stop processing orders for approximately one week 
we anticipate that this will shift net sales for one week from the first quarter to the second quarter 
we have communicated this to our independent associates and members in hopes that they will place orders earlier to avoid delays associated with shipments of their packs and products

index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates in response to sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we review our policies related to the portrayal of our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations that require the application of significant judgment by management 
we also analyze the need for certain estimates  including the need for such items as inventory reserves  capitalization of software development costs  tax valuation allowances  revenue recognition and deferred revenues  accounting for stock based compensation  and contingencies and litigation 
our estimates are based on historical experience  industry standards  and various other assumptions that we believe are applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
we caution readers that actual results could differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and if circumstances change relating to the various assumptions or conditions used in our estimates  we could experience an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations  and consolidated cash flows 
we have identified the following applicable critical accounting policies and estimates as of december  inventory reserves we review our inventory carrying value and compare it to the estimated fair market value 
any inventory value in excess of estimated fair market value is written down 
in addition  we review our inventory for obsolescence and any inventory identified as obsolete is reserved or written off 
our determination of obsolescence is based on assumptions about the demand for our products  product expiration dates  estimated future sales  and future plans 
if actual sales are less favorable than those originally projected by us  additional inventory reserves or write downs may be required 
at december   our net inventories were valued at million  which included an inventory reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventories of approximately million 
capitalization of software development costs we capitalize costs associated with internally developed software projects and amortize costs associated with these projects over their useful lives  which is usually five years 
if accounting standards change or if the capitalized software becomes obsolete  we may be required to write off our unamortized capitalized software or accelerate the amortization period 
during  we began the development and or configuration of several large scaled information technology projects that are intended to increase functionality of our operations and expand our reporting capabilities 
one of these projects was the configuration of our internally developed global re architecture software project  also called our oracle jde globalview fully integrated software project 
as of december   we had approximately million of unamortized capitalized software development costs included in property and equipment and million included in construction in progress  which we plan to put in service in april and amortize ratably over years 
tax valuation allowances we evaluate the probability of realizing the future benefits of our deferred tax assets and record a valuation allowance when we believe that a portion or all of our deferred tax assets may not be realized 
if we are unable to realize the expected future benefits of our deferred tax assets  we are required to provide a valuation allowance 
as of december   our total gross deferred tax assets were million  and we recorded a valuation allowance of million related to certain deferred tax assets for our operations in taiwan and the republic of korea as they do not meet the more likely than not criteria  as defined by the recognition and measurement provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes

index to financial statements revenue recognition and deferred revenues we defer all revenues until our customers receive their shipments 
we also defer a portion of our revenues from the sales of certain starter and renewal packs that contain a one year magazine subscription and defer a portion of revenue from each pack in which the total price of the pack exceeds the total wholesale value of all individual components included in such packs 
we amortize the deferred revenues associated with our one year magazine subscriptions and any pack sales that exceed the total wholesale value of the individual components included in such packs over twelve months 
although we have no immediate plans to significantly change the contents of our packs or our shipping methods  any such change in the future could result in additional revenue deferrals or cause us to recognize deferred revenue over a longer period of time 
for example  if we were to decrease the number of items included in our packs but not change the sales price of our packs  we would have to defer additional revenue and recognize the additional deferred revenue over twelve months 
in june  the fasb s emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation  eitf 
eitf requires disclosure of an entity s accounting policy regarding the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer  including sales  use  value added and some excise taxes 
our policy is to exclude all such taxes from revenue on a net reporting basis 
accounting for stock based compensation beginning on january   we adopted fas r  which requires a company to measure and recognize compensation expense related to any unvested stock options outstanding as of january  and recognize compensation expense for any new stock options granted after december  for the year ended december   the measurement is based on various assumptions  which are as follows average dividend yield of  expected average risk free interest rate of  expected market price volatility of  expected forfeiture rate of  expected average life of stock options of years  and range of the calculated fair value of options granted during the period of to 
based on the above assumptions  we calculate compensation expense and record it in our consolidated statements of operations over the stock options vesting periods  which are generally two or three years 
as of december   we anticipate recognizing million in gross compensation expense through related to unvested stock options outstanding 
in addition  as of december   we had  stock options available to grant in the future 
contingencies and litigation each quarter  we evaluate the need to accrue for legal claims or assessments 
we base our accrual evaluation on our estimated amount of damages and the probability of losing any threatened legal claim 
if circumstances change  or we experience an unanticipated adverse outcome of any legal action  we would be required to increase our estimated amount accrued related to any potential legal action

for the three months and the year ended december  net sales for australia  new zealand  and the united kingdom decreased 
the decrease in the united kingdom was the result of heightened activities in the new markets of denmark and germany 
the decrease in net sales for australia and new zealand was the result of continued consumer questions concerning the reformulation of advanced ambrotose 
the original formulation of advanced ambrotose was introduced in the united states in march and then in other countries in the second half of initial reaction by some consumers to the original formula of advanced ambrotose was unfavorable 
as a result  we introduced a reformulated advanced ambrotose in mid the reformulated advanced ambrotose contains a compound  created using the latest technology  which allows for a more potent concentration of the full size range of mannose containing polysaccharides occurring naturally in aloe into a stable powdered form 
this process allows the compound to possess the most potent and profound immunostimulatory properties because it does not strip the compound of its natural mineral counterparts by organic solvent precipitation  and most importantly  allows the compound to retain a high proportion of molecular weight polysaccharides that are believed to be responsible for the effective immune stimulating properties of aloe 
this enhanced immune stimulating capability has been demonstrated by independent biological assays conducted by hyperion biotechnology 
to help offset the decrease in net sales associated with the questions surrounding our reformulated advanced ambrotose that we experienced in the third quarter of  we launched multi faceted educational and marketing programs to explain the science behind the superior quality and potency of our reformulated advanced ambrotose 
additionally  with the cooperation of our independent associates  we developed a multi tiered marketing program  which includes a number of published articles  tours  other publications  marketing materials and web casts  and conference calls in an effort to further emphasize the advantages of our reformulated advanced ambrotose 
our total sales and our sales mix can be influenced by any of the following changes in our sales prices  changes in consumer demand  changes in competitors products  changes in economic conditions  changes in regulations  announcements of new scientific studies and breakthroughs  introduction of new products  discontinuation of existing products  adverse publicity  and changes in our commissions and incentives programs

our statutory income tax rates by jurisdiction are as follows country for the year ended december  for the year ended december  united states australia united kingdom japan republic of korea taiwan for and  the united states statutory income tax rates include a federal income tax rate of and an average state income tax rate of for and for approximately one third of our total consolidated net sales are derived from our international operations and subject to applicable country specific statutory income tax rates 
income from our international operations is subject to taxation in the countries in which we operate 
although we may receive foreign income tax credits that would reduce the total amount of income taxes owed in the united states  we may not be able to fully utilize our foreign income tax credits in the united states 
we use the recognition and measurement provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  fas  to account for income taxes 
the provisions of fas require a company to record a valuation allowance when the more likely than not criterion for realizing net deferred tax assets cannot be met 
furthermore  the weight given to the potential effect of such evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
as a result  we reviewed the operating results  as well as all of the positive and negative evidence related to realizability of such deferred tax assets to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in each tax jurisdiction 
as of december  and  we maintained our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the republic of korea and taiwan totaling million and million  respectively  as we believe the more likely than not criterion for recognition and realization purposes  as defined in fas  cannot be met 
the dollar amount of the provisions for income taxes is directly impacted by our profitability and a change in the mix of taxable income between countries 
for the three months ended december   our effective income tax rate decreased to from as compared to the same period in for the year ended december   our effective income tax rate decreased to from as compared to the same period in our effective income tax rate decreased as compared to because of an increase in favorable permanent differences  as well as a change in the mix of taxable income between countries

index to financial statements seasonality and selected quarterly statements of operations we believe the impact of seasonality on our consolidated results of operations is minimal 
we have experienced and believe we will continue to experience variations on our quarterly results of operations in response to  among other things the timing of the introduction of new products and incentives  our ability to attract and retain associates and members  the timing of our incentives and contests  the general overall economic outlook  government regulations  the outcome of certain lawsuits  the perception and acceptance of network marketing  and the consumer perception of our products and overall operations 
as a result of these and other factors  our quarterly results may vary significantly in the future 
period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance since we can give no assurances that revenue trends in new markets  as well as in existing markets  will follow our historical patterns 
the market price of our common stock may also be adversely affected by the above factors 
the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments and do not purchase investments as hedges or for purposes other than trading that are likely to expose us to certain types of market risk  including interest rate  commodity price  or equity price risk

we have not issued any debt instruments  entered into any forward or futures contracts  purchased any options  or entered into any swap agreements 
we are exposed to other market risks  including changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
because the change in value of the united states dollar measured against foreign currency may affect our consolidated financial results  changes in foreign currency exchange rates could positively or negatively affect our results as expressed in united states dollars

we assess the sensitivity of our earnings and cash flows to variability in currency exchange rates by applying an appropriate range of potential rate fluctuations to our assets  obligations  and projected transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we caution that we cannot predict with any certainty our future exposure to such currency exchange rate fluctuations or the impact  if any  such fluctuations may have on our future business  product pricing  operating expenses  and on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  to combat such market risk  we closely monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations
