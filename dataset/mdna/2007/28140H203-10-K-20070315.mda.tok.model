where appropriate  the following discussion includes analysis of the effects of our initial public offering and the formation transactions 
we make statements in this section that are forward looking statements  see the section of this form k report entitled forward looking statements

overview we are a self managed and self advised reit engaged in the ownership  acquisition and management of high quality student housing communities 
we also provide student housing development consulting services to universities  charitable foundations and others 
we believe that we are one of the largest private owners  developers and managers of high quality student housing communities in the united states in terms of total beds owned and under management 
we were formed to continue and expand upon the student housing business of the edr predecessor  which commenced in we did not commence operations until the completion of our initial public offering  which occurred on the closing date 
the historical operations prior to the closing date that are described in this report refer to the operations of the edr predecessor 
we have described our operations in this report as if the historical operations of the edr predecessor were conducted by us 
where appropriate  the following discussion includes an analysis of the completion of our initial public offering and certain matters that have occurred following the completion of our initial public offering 
we earn income from rental payments we receive as a result of our ownership of student housing properties 
we also earn income by performing property management services and development consulting services for third parties 
while we manage most of the properties we own  we do not recognize any fee income from their management on a consolidated basis 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
our business segments 
table of contents we define business segments by their distinct customer base and service provided 
management has identified three reportable segments student housing leasing  third party development consulting services and third party management services 
we evaluate each segment s performance based on net operating income  which is defined as income before depreciation  amortization  interest expense and equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities 
the accounting policies of the reportable segments are described in more detail in the summary of significant accounting policies in the footnotes to the financial statements 
inter company fees are reflected at the contractually stipulated amounts 
student housing leasing student housing leasing revenue represented approximately of our revenue  excluding operating expense reimbursements  for the twelve months ended december  our revenue related to food service operations at two locations is included in this segment 
additionally this segment includes other leasing revenue related to the place portfolio lease 
unlike multi family housing where apartments are leased by the unit  student housing communities are typically leased by the bed on an individual lease liability basis 
individual lease liability limits each resident s liability to his or her own rent without liability for a roommate s rent 
a parent or guardian is required to execute each lease as a guarantor unless the resident provides adequate proof of income 
the number of lease contracts that we administer is therefore equivalent to the number of beds occupied instead of the number of apartment units 
due to our predominantly private bedroom accommodations  the high level of student oriented amenities offered at our communities and the individual lease liability  we believe our properties can typically command higher per unit and per square foot rental rates than most multi family properties in the same geographic markets 
we are also typically able to command higher rental rates than on campus student housing  which tends to offer fewer amenities 
the majority of our leases commence mid august and terminate the last day of july 
these dates coincide with the commencement of the universities fall academic term and the completion of the subsequent summer school session 
as such  we are required to re lease each property in its entirety each year  resulting in significant turnover in our tenant population from year to year 
in and  approximately and  respectively  of our beds were leased to students who were first time residents at our properties 
as a result  we are highly dependent upon the effectiveness of our marketing and leasing efforts during the annual leasing season that typically begins in february and ends in august of each year 
our properties occupancy rates are therefore typically stable during the august to july academic year but are susceptible to fluctuation at the commencement of each new academic year 
prior to the commencement of each new lease period  mostly during the first two weeks of august but also during september at some communities  we prepare the units for new incoming tenants 
other than revenue generated by in place leases for returning tenants  we do not generally recognize lease revenue during this period referred to as turn as we have no leases in place 
in addition  during turn we incur significant expenses making our units ready for occupancy  which we recognize immediately 
this lease turn period results in seasonality in our operating results during the third quarter of each year 
third party management services revenue from our third party management services  excluding operating expense reimbursements  represented approximately of our revenue for the twelve months ended december  these revenues are typically derived from multi year management agreements  under which management fees are typically of leasing revenue 
these agreements typically have an initial term of five to ten years with a renewal option for an additional five years 
as part of the management agreements  there are certain payroll and related expenses we pay on behalf of the third party properties owners 
these costs are referred to as reimbursable operating expenses and are required to be reimbursed to us by the third party property owners 
we recognize the expense and revenue related to these reimbursements when incurred 
these operating expenses are wholly reimbursable and therefore not considered by our management when analyzing the operating performance of our third party management services business 
third party development consulting services revenue from our third party development consulting services  excluding operating expense reimbursements  represented approximately of our revenue for the twelve months ended december  fees for these services are typically of the total project cost and are payable over the life of the project  which is typically one to two years in length 
we incur expenses that are reimbursable by a project when awarded 
we recognize the expenses when incurred  while the reimbursement revenue is not recognized until the consulting contract is awarded 
these operating expenses are wholly reimbursable and therefore not considered by our management when analyzing the operating performance of our third party development consulting services business 
also at 
table of contents times we will pay pre development project expenses such as architectural fees and permits if such are required prior to the project s financing being in place 
we typically obtain a guarantee from the owner for repayment 
we periodically enter into joint venture arrangements whereby we provide development consulting services to third party student housing owners in an agency capacity 
we recognize our portion of the earnings in each joint venture based on our ownership interest  which is reflected as equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities after net operating income in our statement of operations 
our revenue and operating expenses could fluctuate from period to period based on the extent we utilize joint venture arrangements to provide third party development consulting services 
the amount and timing of future revenues from development consulting services will be contingent upon our ability to successfully compete in public universities competitive procurement processes  our ability to successfully structure financing of these projects  and our ability to ensure completion of construction within agreed construction timelines and budgets 
to date  all of our third party development projects have completed construction in time for their targeted occupancy dates 
trends and outlook rents and occupancy we expect the general trends of increased university enrollment and limited availability of on campus housing to continue for the foreseeable future  providing us with continued opportunities to maximize revenues through increased occupancy and or rental rates in our owned portfolio 
we manage our properties to maximize revenues  which are primarily determined by two components rental rates and occupancy rates 
we customarily adjust rental rates in order to maximize revenues  which in some cases results in a lower occupancy rate  but in most cases results in stable or increasing revenues from the property 
as a result  a decrease in occupancy rates may be offset by an increase in rental rates and may not be material to our operations 
general and administrative costs as a result of becoming a public company in january  we experienced significant increases in payroll  legal and accounting costs  director fees  costs related to communicating with stockholders  including ongoing communications and distribution of proxy statements in connection with stockholder meetings  as well as other cost that are unique to being a public company 
we also experienced increases in due to continued growth in payroll and the additional costs associated with formulating and documenting our internal control systems and implementation of the sarbanes oxley act of for the year ended december  the costs related to documenting our internal control systems and implementation of the sarbanes oxley act of totaled approximately critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized all available information  including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome anticipated by management in formulating its estimates may not be realized 
application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies 
student housing leasing revenue recognition student housing leasing revenue is comprised of revenue related to the leasing activities at the student housing properties and includes revenues from the leasing of space  parking lot rentals and certain ancillary services 
also included in this segment is revenue from our food service operations and other leasing revenue related to the place portfolio lease 
students are required to execute lease contracts with payment schedules that vary from single to monthly payments 
generally  a nonrefundable application fee  a nonrefundable service fee and a notarized parental guarantee must accompany each executed contract 
receivables are recorded when due  and leasing revenues and related lease incentives and nonrefundable application and service fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contracts 
balances are considered past due when payment is not received on the contractual due date 
allowances for doubtful accounts are established by management when it is determined that collection is doubtful 

table of contents student housing food service revenue recognition we provide food service to an unaffiliated secondary boarding school through a contract covering a nine month period 
the contract requires a flat weekly fee and the related revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period 
this contract was terminated affective december  additionally  we maintain a dining facility at university towers  which offers meal plans to the tenants as well as dining to other third party customers 
the meal plans typically require upfront payment by the tenant covering the school semester and the related revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the corresponding semester 
other leasing revenue recognition other leasing revenue relates to our leasing of properties we acquired from place properties place 
simultaneous with the acquisition of the properties  the trust leased the assets to place and receives base monthly rent of  and has the right to receive additional rent annually if the properties exceed certain criteria defined in the lease agreement 
base rent is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term and additional rent is recognized only upon satisfaction of the defined criteria 
revenue and cost recognition of third party development consulting services costs associated with the pursuit of third party development consulting contracts are expensed as incurred until such time as we have been notified of a contract award or reimbursement has been otherwise guaranteed by the customer 
at such time  the reimbursable portion of such costs is recorded as a receivable 
development consulting revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method as determined by construction costs incurred relative to the total estimated construction costs 
costs associated with development consulting services are expensed as incurred 
we generally receive a significant percentage of our fees for development consulting services upon closing of the project financing  a portion of the fee over the construction period  and the balance upon substantial completion of construction 
because revenue from these services is recognized for financial reporting purposes utilizing the percentage of completion method  differences occur between amounts received and revenues recognized 
differences also occur between amounts recognized for tax purposes and those recognized from financial reporting purposes 
because as a reit  we are required to distribute of our taxable income  our distribution requirement with respect to our income from third party services may exceed that reflected as net income for financial reporting purposes from such activities 
we periodically enter into joint venture arrangements whereby we provide development consulting services to third party student housing owners in an agency capacity 
we recognize our portion of the earnings in each joint venture based on our ownership interest  which is reflected after net operating income in our statement of operations as equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities 
our revenue and operating expenses could fluctuate from period to period based on the extent we utilize joint venture arrangements to provide third party development consulting services 
student housing property acquisitions land  land improvements  buildings and improvements  and furniture  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years  land improvements are depreciated over years and furniture  fixtures  and equipment are depreciated over to years 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method for financial reporting purposes 
property acquisitions initiated subsequent to june  are accounted for utilizing the purchase method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and accordingly  the results of operations are included in the results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition 
pre acquisition costs  including legal and professional fees and other third party costs related directly to the acquisition of the property  are accounted for as part of the purchase price 
independent appraisals  obtained at the time of the original acquisition by the owners of the properties we acquired in our formation transactions  estimates of cash flows  and valuation techniques are used to allocate the purchase price of acquired property between land  land improvements  buildings and improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment and other identifiable intangibles such as amounts related to in place leases 
repairs and maintenance the costs of ordinary repairs and maintenance are charged to operations when incurred 
major improvements that extend the life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
planned major repair  maintenance and improvement projects are capitalized when performed 
in some circumstances the lenders require us to maintain a reserve account for future repairs and capital expenditures 
these amounts are not available for current use 
long lived assets impairment 
table of contents management is required to assess whether there are any indicators that our real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is considered impaired if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property 
these estimates of cash flows are based on factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property  thereby reducing our net income

revenue from student housing leasing increased  to  for the year ended december  this increase in revenue from the same period in is attributable to a significant increase in beds by way of acquisition and the addition of other leasing revenue related to the property place portfolio lease discussed below 
aggregate design beds for the year ended december  increased  beds or over the same period last year to  beds 
at current revpab rates this acquisition driven increase in beds represents about  of the increased revenue for the year ended december   while growth in same community revenue contributed approximately in january we completed the acquisition of a property portfolio from place properties 
simultaneous with the acquisition we entered into a lease agreement under which place properties leases and operates the properties 
other leasing revenue related to the lease contributed  of revenue for the year ended december   including the recognition of of additional rent  as defined in the lease agreement 
student housing food service revenue was relatively flat at about  approximately  of student housing food service revenue was related to a contract to provide food service to a secondary boarding school in california 
this contract was terminated effective december  operating expenses of our student housing communities increased  to  for the year ended december  expense growth of approximately  is attributable to increased beds by way of acquisition as discussed above 
same store operating expenses year over year were held relatively flat mainly as a result of improvements in turn costs and bad debt expense along with other improvements that combined to offset higher utility costs and property taxes for the period 
intersegment expenses  which represent management fees paid to our management company increased just over as a result of acquired beds and higher revenue 
the net impact of the growth in revenue and expenses noted above was a rise in net operating income for the segment to  for the year ended december  as noted a majority of the growth came through acquisition and the addition of other leasing revenue related to the place portfolio which drove an increase in operating margins from to for the segment

during the same period in we recognized development fees on two projects  recognized of purchasing fees related to a third project  and recognized construction oversight fees on another two projects 
the increased volume in development consulting revenue is mainly due to an increase in the number of projects being managed by our development subsidiary aodc but also represents a shift in the percentage of new projects aodc contracts directly 
in previous years the majority of our development services were contracted through joint venture relationships with the profits from those services being recognized through equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities remained flat at just over for the years ended december  and during there were five projects underway representing  beds while four projects representing  beds were being managed through joint ventures in general and administrative costs in the third party development consulting services was held relatively flat year over year at just over  for the years ended december  and third party management services third party management services revenues increased to  for the year ended december  from

offsetting these increases was a decline of as a result of the termination of two management agreements during the summer of general and administrative costs for our third party management services increased  to  for the year ended december  this increase is a direct result of the growth in both our owned and managed portfolios as discussed above 
our owned portfolio grew from properties at the start of to properties at the end of in addition the third party management services group added a total of ten new properties to its managed portfolio since the spring of  while two contracts were terminated 
additional growth in general and administrative expenses occurred due to a higher overhead burden as a result of the overall growth of the company 
nonoperating expenses nonoperating expenses increased  to  for the year ended december  the increase is driven by approximately  of additional interest expense and  of additional depreciation and amortization related mainly to the acquisition of the properties from place properties in january and a full twelve months of expense in the current period related to acquisitions made during these increases were partially offset by a  decline in amortization of deferred financing costs as a result of prepayment penalties on early retirement of debt that was incurred in the first quarter of we anticipate continued pressures on in interest expense as a result of recent acquisitions as well as the potential of continued increases in interest rates 
however  we also plan on paying down our variable rate debt with excess cash in other corporate expenses other corporate expenses represent general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to the third party development consulting and third party management services segments 
intersegment management fees are charged to the student housing leasing segment so it is not allocated any corporate expenses 
for the year ended december  other corporate expenses were  an increase of  over the prior year 
corporate related net interest expense was approximately in compared to net interest income of approximately in the change is a result of higher than usual interest income in the second half of related to uninvested funds from our private equity offering in september in the private equity offering funds were used in the acquisition of the place portfolio and additional interest expense was incurred as funds were drawn on our revolving credit facility to partially fund distributions to our shareholders

our base portfolio of edr predecessor properties experienced a decrease in revenue per available bed over the comparable period of part of the decrease was due to a drop in occupancy at two of our properties as a result of increased supply around the universities 
in addition we had a planned drop in rates at our university towers property designed to reverse a negative trend in occupancy experienced during the academic year 
this rate adjustment along with a focused marketing effort has successfully reversed the trend at university towers resulting in occupancy at the beginning of the current lease term of approximately compared to a year earlier 

table of contents operating expenses of our student housing communities increased  to  for the year ended december  the majority of this increase was also due to the addition of the jpi properties and the incremental impact relating to the five new properties as described above 
however  the growth in operating expenses outpaced revenue growth year over year 
higher than anticipated utility costs  turn costs  bad debt expense  and student amenity costs contributed to operating expenses  excluding intersegment charges  as a percentage of revenue to increase 
the higher utility costs are a result of current economic conditions  however  management has begun instituting energy conservation programs in an effort to control these costs as much as possible 
the increase in student amenities is mostly the result of additional costs to meet student demand for better and faster internet capabilities 
management anticipates continued challenges managing these costs in the future 
the increased costs related to turn and bad debt expense are considered by management to be one time issues related to acquired properties and their assimilation into our operating structure 
while higher than normal bad debt charges were a cost of transitioning the properties  management believes the additional turn costs incurred were necessary to position the properties appropriately in the market and view them as an investment in the future leasing success of the properties 
third party development consulting services third party development services revenues increased by  to  for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase relates to revenue recognized on four projects in compared to one project during the same period in a portion of our third party development consulting services have been conducted through joint venture arrangements  and the related fees recognized as equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities decreased by to for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to more of our projects being contracted directly with the universities and is reflected in the increase in third party development services revenue 
there were two projects with a total of  beds under development through joint ventures during compared to four projects with a total of  beds during the same period in general and administrative costs in the third party development consulting services increased  to  for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses increased as a result of the higher volume of development projects and an expansion of the department 
additional growth in general and administrative expenses occurred due to a higher overhead burden as a result of the overall growth of the company and its entry into the public market 
third party management services third party management services revenues increased by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  revenue increased  due to intersegment charges to owned properties as a result of the growth in our portfolio from seven to twenty six properties 
third party revenue increased year over year as a result of benefiting from a full year of management fees on four managed properties consisting of  beds that opened in fall  the opening of new managed properties in august and september of and a new management contract for a bed facility at the university of texas in september general and administrative costs for our third party management services increased  to  for the year ended december  this increase is a direct result of the extraordinary growth in both our owned and managed portfolios as discussed above 
our owned portfolio grew from properties to properties through our offering and formation transactions as well as our acquisition program 
in addition the third party management services group added a total of eight new properties to its managed portfolio since summer additional growth in general and administrative expenses occurred due to a higher overhead burden as a result of the overall growth of the company and its entry into the public market 
nonoperating expenses nonoperating expenses increased  to  for the year ended december  the increase includes  in fees on the early retirement of debt but relates substantially to an approximate  increase in depreciation and amortization and an approximate  dollar increase in mortgage interest expense as a result of the property jpi acquisition and the acquisition of five additional properties during the year 
liquidity and capital resources revolving credit facility and other indebtedness on march  the operating partnership amended and restated the revolving credit facility  or the amended revolver  dated january  in the amount of million and entered into a senior unsecured term loan facility  or the term loan  in the amount of  edr serves as the guarantor for any funds borrowed by the operating partnership under the amended revolver 
table of contents and the term loan 
additionally  the amended revolver is secured by a cross collateralized  first mortgage lien on all mortgaged properties 
the term loan is not directly secured by a lien but has the benefit of a negative pledge on the equity interest in the mortgaged properties 
the amended revolver and term loan have a term of three years and mature on march   provided that the operating partnership may extend the maturity date for one year subject to certain conditions 
at december   there was  outstanding under the amended revolver and  outstanding under the term loan 
the term loan is interest only  hence  the entire outstanding balance of  is due on the maturity date 
availability under the operating partnership s amended revolver is limited to a borrowing base availability equal to the lesser of i of the property asset value of the properties securing the facility and ii the loan amount which would produce a debt service coverage ratio of no less than  with debt service based on the greater of two different sets of conditions specified in the amended credit agreement 
the operating partnership s amended revolver and term loan contain customary affirmative and negative covenants and do contain financial covenants that  among other things  require the trust and it s subsidiaries to maintain certain minimum ratios of ebitda earnings before payment or charges of interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization or extraordinary items as compared to interest expense and total fixed charges 
the financial covenants also include consolidated net worth and leverage ratio tests 
edr is prohibited from making distributions that exceed per share unless prior to and after giving effect to such action the total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 
the amount of restricted payments permitted may be increased as long as either of the following conditions is met a after giving effect to the increased restricted payment  the total leverage ratio shall remain less than or equal to  or b the increased restricted payment  when considered along with all other restricted payments for the last quarters  does not exceed i of funds from operations for the applicable period through and including december   and ii of funds from operations for the applicable period thereafter 
the interest rate per annum applicable to the amended revolver is  at the operating partnership s option  equal to a base rate or libor plus an applicable margin based upon our leverage 
the interest rate per annum applicable to the term loan is  at the operating partnership s option  equal to a base rate plus or libor plus liquidity outlook and capital requirements at december  we had  of cash  a decrease of approximately  from december  this decrease is a result of funding the purchase of the property portfolio from place properties in january in addition to the decline in cash balances we added approximately  of debt during due to the assumption of  of mortgage debt in the place properties acquisition as well as  net draws on our line of credit and term loan to completely fund the place properties acquisition  our june th acquisition of the players club community in statesboro  ga  and to cover certain shortfalls in operating cash 
our current liquidity needs include funds for distributions to our stockholders and unit holders  including those required to maintain our reit status and satisfy our current annual distribution target of per share unit  funds for capital expenditures  funds for debt repayment and  potentially  funds for new property acquisitions 
we generally expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations 
however  distributions for the last two years outpaced cash from operations during the same period 
distributions to shareholders unitholders totaled  or per weighted average share unit in compared to cash from operations of  or per weighted average share unit and distributions in totaled  or per weighted average share unit compared to cash from operations of  or per weighted average share unit during the same time 
the resulting operating cash shortfalls of  and  for and  respectively  were funded by draws on our revolving line of credit 
effective with our third quarter dividend that was paid on november  we adjusted our annual dividend rate from the existing per share unit down to per share unit  which is more in line with our current operating cash and ffo levels 
we feel this addresses the operating cash shortfalls for the near term and positions us to utilize capital resources for all the funding requirements noted above 
we expect our long term liquidity requirements to be satisfied through growth in cash generated by operations and external sources of debt and equity capital  including public capital markets as well as private sources of capital 
to the extent that we are unable to maintain our revolving credit facility or an equivalent source of debt financing  we will be more reliant upon the public and private capital markets to meet our long term liquidity needs 
an additional source of capital is the possible disposition of non core properties 
we continually assess all of our properties  the markets they are in  and the universities they serve to determine if any dispositions are necessary or appropriate 
the sale of any unencumbered asset would provide additional capital to most likely paydown debt or possibly finance other operational acquisitions or operational needs 
subsequent to december  we entered into agreements with two unrelated parties for the possible sale of two unencumbered assets 
at this time there is no certainty that the deals will close as they are still in the due diligence period and no earnest money is yet at risk 

table of contents in the third quarter the sec declared effective our newly established dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
the plan allows existing investors to reinvest dividends and allows both existing and new investors to purchase shares of edr directly from the company at a discount 
total capital of  representing  shares  was issued during based on our closing share price of on december  our total enterprise value was  with total debt outstanding on december  of  our current debt to total enterprise value was 
we believe our capital structure and current ffo and distribution targets along with the  remaining availability under our amended revolver leaves us with sufficient liquidity and access to financing to fund current working capital needs and make future student housing investments 
current market conditions and rising interest rates are expected to make additional capital more expensive for us and could impact our access to the capital markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing under satisfactory conditions or that we will make any investments in additional properties 
we intend to invest in additional properties only as suitable opportunities arise 
in the short term  we intend to fund any acquisitions with working capital and borrowings under first mortgage property secured debt or our million revolving credit facility 
we intend to finance property acquisitions over the longer term with the proceeds from additional issuances of common or preferred stock  debt financing and issuances of units of our operating partnership 
we anticipate that our existing working capital and cash from operations will be adequate to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 
predevelopment expenditures our third party development consulting activities have historically required us to fund predevelopment expenditures such as architectural fees  permits  and deposits 
because the closing of a development project s financing is often subject to third party delay  we cannot always predict accurately the liquidity needs of these activities 
we frequently incur these predevelopment expenditures before a financing commitment has been obtained and  accordingly  bear the risk of the loss of these predevelopment expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms 
we typically obtain from the project owner a guarantee of repayment of these predevelopment expenditures  but no assurance can be given that we would be successful in collecting the amount guaranteed in the event that a project financing is not obtained 
in the event that we develop properties for ownership by the trust our exposure and capital requirements related to development activities will increase dramatically 
long term liquidity requirements our long term liquidity requirements consists primarily of funds necessary to pay scheduled debt maturities  renovations  expansion and other non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our properties 
we expect to meet these needs through existing working capital  cash provided by operations  additional borrowings under our amended revolver  and the issuance of equity instruments  including common stock  or additional or replacement debt  if market conditions permit 
we believe these sources of capital will be sufficient to provide for our long term capital needs 
our amended revolver and term loan are material sources to satisfy our long term liquidity requirements 
as such compliance with their financial and operating debt covenants is material to our liquidity 
non compliance with the covenants would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
capital expenditures the historical recurring capital expenditures at our owned and managed communities  excluding the properties leased to place properties  are set forth below as of and for the years ended december  total units total beds total recurring capital expenditures average per unit average per bed recurring capital expenditures exclude capital spending on renovations  community repositioning  or other major periodic projects 
capital expenditures associated with newly acquired or developed properties are typically capitalized as part of their 
table of contents acquisition price or development budget 
as a result such properties typically do not require capital expenditures until their second year of operation or later 
additionally  we are required by certain of our lenders to contribute contractual amounts annually to reserves for capital repairs and improvements at the mortgaged properties 
these contributions may be less than or exceed the amount of capital expenditures actually incurred during any given year at such properties 
commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  less than after year years years years total in thousands contractual obligations long term debt obligations contractual fixed interest obligations operating lease and future purchase obligations capital reserve obligations total includes required monthly principal amortization and amounts due at maturity on first mortgage debt secured by student housing properties and amounts due under amended revolver and term loan agreements 
includes contractual fixed rate interest payments 
includes future minimum lease commitments under operating lease obligations and future purchase obligations for advertising 
includes future annual contributions to the capital reserve as required by certain mortgage debt 
long term indebtedness in conjunction with the formation transactions  the operating partnership assumed total fixed rate mortgage debt of  with an average interest rate of approximately 
concurrent with the closing of the formation transactions  the operating partnership paid off  of the assumed debt 
in connection with management s decision to prepay certain debt obligations  we recognized a charge of  in february in march  the operating partnership assumed an additional  of mortgage debt with a fixed interest rate of in connection with the acquisition of a student housing property located at the university of south carolina 
in june  the operating partnership assumed  of additional mortgage debt with a fixed interest rate of in connection with the acquisition of a student housing property located near the university of florida 
in january  the operating partnership assumed an additional  of mortgage debt with a fixed interest rate of in connection with the acquisition of the place portfolio 
at december   we had outstanding indebtedness of  net of unamortized debt premium of 
the scheduled future maturities of all outstanding indebtedness at december  are as follows year thereafter total debt premium outstanding as of december   net of debt premium at december   the outstanding mortgage debt had a weighted average interest rate of and carried an average term to maturity of years 
our ratio of mortgage debt to total market capitalization was approximately at december  
table of contents three mortgages totaling  are scheduled to mature within five months of december  on march  two of the mortgages totaling  were refinanced at a new rate of compared to the existing rate of 
we expect to refinance the third mortgage in the near future 
in addition to mortgage debt  the trust also had  outstanding under the amended revolver and  outstanding under the term loan 
the amended revolver and the term loan have a term of three years and mature on march   provided that the operating partnership may extend the maturity date for one year subject to certain conditions 
the amended revolver and term loan require interest only payments through maturity 
the interest rate per annum applicable to the amended revolver is  at the operating partnership s option  equal to a base rate or libor plus an applicable margin based upon our leverage at december  
the interest rate per annum applicable to the term loan is  at the operating partnership s option  equal to a base rate plus or libor plus at december  
distributions we are required to distribute of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains on an annual basis in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
accordingly  we intend to make  but are not contractually bound to make  regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock 
all such distributions are at the discretion of our board of directors 
we may be required to use borrowings under our revolving credit facility  if necessary  to meet reit distribution requirements and maintain our reit status 
we consider market factors and our performance in addition to reit requirements in determining distribution levels 
as a result of these considerations we adjusted our existing annual dividend target of per share unit to per share unit effective with the second quarter dividend that was paid on november  the new dividend target is more in line with current ffo and operating cash flow levels and put us in a better position to take advantage of opportunities to pay down debt or invest in other student housing assets 
on january  we announced our fourth quarter distribution of per share of common stock for the quarter ending on december  the distribution is payable on february  to stockholders of record at the close of business on january  off balance sheet arrangements as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements we hold investments in unconsolidated entities 
three of these unconsolidated entities have third party mortgage indebtedness totaling  at december  additionally  on may   the operating partnership guaranteed  of construction debt held by university village greensboro llc in order to receive a ownership stake in the venture with college park apartments 
the construction debt is expected to be refinanced in september of after construction is complete and the student housing community is occupied 
the operating partnership will not guarantee the debt after the construction loan is refinanced 
funds from operations as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
we present ffo available to all shareholders and unitholders because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  many of which present ffo when reporting their results 
as such  we also exclude the impact of minority interest in our calculation 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its march white paper as amended in november and april  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
further  ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
we changed the presentation of ffo beginning with our form q covering the three months ended march  to presenting ffo available to all shareholders and unitholders 
previously  including in our form k for the year ended december   we presented only ffo available to common shareholders 
the impact of this change is the exclusion of the impact of minority interest expense on ffo in the amount of  
table of contents the following table presents a reconciliation of our ffo available to our shareholders and unitholders to our net income for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands net income loss plus student housing property depreciation and amortization of lease intangibles plus equity portion of real estate depreciation and amortization on equity investees plus minority interest benefit funds from operations available to all share and unit holders inflation our student housing leases typically do not have terms that extend beyond twelve months 
accordingly  although on a short term basis we would be required to bear the impact of rising costs resulting from inflation  we have the opportunity to raise rental rates at least annually to offset such rising costs 
however  our ability to raise rental rates may be limited by a weak economic environment  increased competition from new student housing in our primary markets or a reduction in student enrollment at our principal universities 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  sfas no 
 exchange of nonmonetary assets  was issued 
sfas no 
amends apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
that exception required that some nonmonetary exchanges be recorded on a carryover basis versus sfas no 
 which requires an entity record a nonmonetary exchange at fair value and recognize any gain or loss if the transaction has commercial substance 
the standard specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective the fiscal year beginning january  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the trust s consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
revised december  share based payment statement r 
statement r replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
statement r requires compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
with limited exceptions  the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity instruments issued 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
statement r is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  the trust adopted statement r effective january   and it did not have a material impact on the trust s consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulleting sab to provide public companies additional guidance in applying the provisions of statement r 
among other things  sab describes the sec staff s expectations in determining the assumptions that underlie the fair value estimates and discusses the interaction of statement r with certain existing sec guidance 
the guidance is also beneficial to users of financial statements in analyzing the information provided under statement r 
sab was applied upon the adoption of statement r 
in june  the fasb ratified eitf determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf 
eitf provides a framework for determining whether a general partner is required to consolidate limited partners 
the new framework is significantly different than the guidance in sop and makes it more difficult for a general partner to overcome the presumption that it controls the limited partnership  requiring the limited partner to have substantive kick out or participating rights 
kick out rights are the right to dissolve or liquidate the partnership or to otherwise remove the general partner without cause and participating rights are the right to effectively participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the partnership s business 
eitf became effective immediately for all newly formed limited partnerships and existing limited partnerships which are modified 
the guidance became effective for existing limited partnerships which are not modified the beginning of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on the trust s consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb 
table of contents statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on description  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin becomes effective on january  the trust is currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on its consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which becomes effective for fiscal years ending after november  sab provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior period misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab requires an entity to evaluate the impact of correcting all misstatements  including both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements  on current year financial statements 
if a misstatement is material to the current year financial statements  the prior year financial statements should also be corrected  even though such revision was  and continues to be  immaterial to the prior year financial statements 
correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended 
such correction should be made in the current period filings 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on the trust s consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas does not address what to measure at fair value  instead  it addresses how to measure fair value 
sfas applies with limited exceptions to existing standards that require assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy  giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data and requires new disclosures for assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on their level in the hierarchy 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the trust is currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on its consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the trust s interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  the trust manages its exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for its borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income to common shareholders or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income to common stockholders and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december  we had fixed rate debt of  holding other variables constant a basis point increase in interest rates would cause a  decline in the fair value for our fixed rate debt 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would cause a  increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
at december   all of the outstanding principal amounts of our mortgage notes payable on the properties we own have fixed interest rates with a weighted average rate of and an average term to maturity of years 
at december   we had a  variable rate term loan and  drawn on the amended revolver 
the interest rate per annum applicable to the amended revolver is  at the operating partnership s option  equal to a base rate or libor plus an applicable margin based upon our leverage 
the interest rate per annum applicable to the term loan is  at the operating partnership s option  equal to a base rate plus or libor plus 
for the year ended december   the term loan had an average interest rate of 
holding other variables constant a basis point increase in interest rates would cause a decrease annually in net income available to our common stockholders and a basis point decrease in interest rates would cause a increase annually in net income available to our common stockholders 
approximately of the trust s outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates at december  we may in the future use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to such variable rate borrowings 
we do not  and do not expect to  use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes  and we expect to enter into contracts only with major financial institutions
