we currently market four prescription pharmaceutical products to the dermatology market through our professional dermatology sales force and generate revenues from four other prescription pharmaceutical products that we continue to sell to the dental market 
in may  the us food and drug administration  or the fda  granted us marketing approval for oracea for the treatment of inflammatory lesions papules and pustules of rosacea in adult patients 
oracea is the first fda approved  orally administered  systemically delivered drug to treat rosacea 
in july  we launched oracea to the us dermatology community 
our strategy is to become a leading developer and marketer of innovative prescription pharmaceutical products to the dermatology market 
we intend to continue to market our current products  including oracea  and develop and launch new products based on our proprietary platform technologies as well as other technologies 
our lead development candidates are incyclinide formerly known as col  which is currently in two separate phase ii dose finding clinical trials for the treatment of acne and rosacea  col  a topical compound for which we are developing for the treatment of erythema skin redness associated with dermatological conditions and for which we recently completed the clinical portion of a phase i clinical trial  and our restoraderm  a foam based  topical dermal drug delivery system  which is currently under development 
our marketed dermatology products are oracea  pandel  a prescription corticosteroid we licensed from altana  inc in may  alcortin  a prescription topical antifungal steroid combination  and novacort  a prescription topical steroid and anesthetic 
in june  we executed a promotion and cooperation agreement with primus pharmaceuticals inc  or primus  to market alcortin and novacort to dermatologists 
our original dental product  periostat  is an orally administered  prescription pharmaceutical product that was approved by the fda in september for the treatment of adult periodontitis 
on may   we terminated our dental sales force and promotional activities for periostat following the introduction of a third party generic version of the product 
we also discontinued the promotion of our other dental products on may  we continue to generate sales from periostat and three other dental products  which include atridox  atrisorb freeflow and atrisorb d  also referred to as the atrix products  and are each licensed from tolmar inc  a subsidiary of tecnofarma  sa in addition to our marketed products  we have a pipeline of product candidates in clinical and preclinical development 
these products are based on our proprietary platform technologies  impacs  sansrosa and restoraderm 
impacs inhibitors of multiple proteases and cytokines are a group of compounds that demonstrate a range of anti inflammatory activities as well as the ability to inhibit the breakdown of connective tissue 
periostat and oracea are our first fda approved impacs products 
incyclinide is an impacs compound currently in clinical development for the treatment of acne and rosacea 
our impacs technology is licensed on a perpetual basis from the research foundation of the state university of new york at stony brook  or suny 
suny also conducts research and development on other potential applications of this technology on a project basis 
our sansrosa technology  which we acquired in connection with the acquisition of sansrosa pharmaceutical development inc  or sansrosa  in december  is a class of compounds that have shown promise in reducing the redness associated with rosacea  and we intend to formulate and develop a topical treatment for rosacea based on one or more of these compounds 
our restoraderm technology is a proprietary  foam based  topical drug delivery technology that originated from a swedish collaborator 
we have acquired all rights  title and interest to the restoraderm technology 
we have formulated various prescription and over the counter products based on the restoraderm technology 
we do not currently have a timetable for either the initiation of clinical development or the launch of any restoraderm products

net revenues from the sale of dermatology products were nearly of total revenue in compared to in  reflecting our transition from a dental pharmaceutical company to a company focused on developing and marketing prescription pharmaceutical products for the dermatology market 
the decrease in net product sales was primarily due to lower periostat net sales and the elimination of sales of united research laboratories  inc mutual pharmaceutical company  inc  or mutual s  branded version of periostat as a result of the launch of a third party generic competitor in may  offset in part by net sales of oracea following its market launch in july contract revenues during the year ended december   were derived primarily from our promotion and cooperation agreement with primus for the alcortin and novacort products 
the promotion and cooperation agreement was executed in june  the increase in is attributable to having a full year of sales 
during the year ended december   contract revenues were primarily derived from residual contract revenue from our expired agreement with merck co  inc for vioxx and from our promotion and cooperation agreement with primus for the alcortin and novacort products

personnel and direct internal overhead expenses  including consulting and regulatory costs incurred during the year ended december   were approximately million 
we estimate that if incyclinide is developed to the point of commercialization for both acne and rosacea indications  the additional formulation and clinical development expenses and milestone fees expected to be incurred to product commercialization  would be between million and million 
we are currently conducting formulation and stability work on products incorporating our restoraderm technology  and we are reviewing product options and the timetable associated with clinical development or commercial launch

management believes the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements pertain to revenue recognition  stock compensation and the valuation of deferred taxes  intangible assets and inventory 
revenue recognition we generally recognize revenues for product sales upon shipment to wholesale customers  net of estimated returns and estimates for chargebacks  applicable wholesale distribution fees and rebates provided that collection was probable and no significant obligations remained 
following the launch of a third party generic competitor to periostat in may and commencing with the second quarter of  we began recognizing periostat sales revenue based on product sales to end users  which are estimated using prescription dispensing data generated by an independent prescription tracking service 
while we do not independently verify the prescription dispensing data  we do analyze shipments and estimates of channel inventory to determined if the prescription dispensing data is consistent with our records 
the launch of generic competition to periostat resulted in increased product returns from the wholesale and retail channels 
as of december   we have a liability of  for potential periostat product returns in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet for estimated returns prior to the change to a prescription based revenue recognition model 
for new product launches our policy is to recognize revenue on a net prescription value basis using dispensing data generated by an independent prescription tracking service until trade channel inventories are reduced to targeted stocking levels and we have sufficient data to determine product acceptance in the marketplace which will enable us to estimate product returns based on historical data of periostat and similar products 
net prescription value is calculated by deducting estimates for chargebacks  wholesale distribution fees  patient rebates  government rebates and any other launch discounts offered from the applicable gross sales value 
when inventories have been reduced to target wholesale and retail levels and we have the ability to estimate product returns  we recognize product sales upon shipment  net of discounts  returns and allowances 
during the fourth quarter of  based on sales levels and prescription data related to the fourth quarter of and the number of units on hand in the pipeline relative to overall demand for the product  we determined that oracea inventories with our customers had reached normal targeted levels 
at such time  we began recognizing oracea revenues on a shipment basis  net applicable discounts and allowances 
oracea revenues for the year ended december   reflect revenue recognition on a shipment basis  net of applicable discounts and allowances as the company recognized  in the fourth quarter of  approximately  in previously deferred oracea revenues from the third quarter of as described above  we record sales discounts  allowances and returns upon recognizing product sales 
we only accept unopened returns of damaged or expired products 
the return allowance  when estimatable  is based on an analysis of the historical returns of the product and similar products and we consider current end user demand and wholesale and retail inventory levels 
if product returns are not estimatable  we defer revenue recognition for all outstanding products in the wholesale and retail channel that is subject to return 
pursuant to an agreement with one major customer  product returns are not permitted 
chargebacks  wholesale distribution fees and rebates are based on an analysis of the applicable agreements and historical experience 
in addition  we also consider the volume and price of the product in the channel  trends in wholesaler and retailer inventory levels  conditions that might affect end user demand such as generic competition and other relevant factors 
during the third quarter of  we launched oracea to the us dermatology community 
as part of such launch  we introduced a patient rebate program for oracea prescriptions 
only patients presenting the computer coded card to their pharmacists were entitled to receive the rebate 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer  we have accounted for these patient rebates as a reduction of net product sales on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  deferred taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider the likelihood that part or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment requires significant judgment and estimates 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider our history of losses  scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities  deferred tax planning strategies  if any  and projected future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax asset items are deductible 
the tax reform act of contains provisions that may limit the net operating loss and research and experimentation credit carryforwards available to be used in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interest 
we have incurred a net loss for the years ended december  and  and uncertainty regarding our future profitability has prevented us from reaching the more likely than not conclusion required under the applicable literature to recognize deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
intangible assets acquired product rights and oracea milestone fees are stated at cost  amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the products or the contract term under which such rights have been licensed  using the straight line method 
amortization of acquired product rights and oracea milestone fees are charged to cost of product sales 
we are required to test for asset impairment of acquired product rights and oracea milestone fees whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we apply statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
this standard requires an impairment analysis when indicators of impairment are present 
when such indicators are present  the standard indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows from the asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  are less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
in making future cash flow analyses of our intangible assets we make assumptions relating to i the intended use of the product and the expected future cash flows resulting directly from such use  ii generic competitor activities and regulatory initiatives that affect our products  and iii customer preferences and expected managed care reimbursement 
inventories inventory carrying values are evaluated periodically and consider the saleable quantities of inventory versus quantities of inventory on hand 
during the year ended december   we recorded write downs of  for excess and short dated inventory 
during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million for the excess inventory of periostat and mutual s branded version of periostat due to the anticipated decreased demand following the introduction of a third party generic version of periostat that occurred in may we classify direct manufacturing costs relating to inventory and samples manufactured in advance of a new product launch as research and development expense until such time as we receive an approval letter from the fda for a new product 
following fda approval of the product  we capitalize any inventory costs relating to that product that were not previously expensed 
stock based compensation as part of our adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  as of january   we recognized the fair value of stock based compensation awards in our consolidated financial statements using the modified prospective method 
we apply the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  and we estimate key assumptions that are important elements in the model  such as the expected stock price volatility and expected stock option life 
our estimates of these important assumptions and expected forfeiture rates are based on historical data and judgment regarding market trends and factors 
these estimates are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by individuals who receive equity awards 
critical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions warrant  and changes to such estimates are recorded as new information or changed conditions require revision 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying financial misstatements in current year financial statements  which expresses the staff s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
companies are required to quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements  including both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements  on the current year financial statements 
the techniques most commonly used in practice to accumulate and quantify misstatements are generally referred to as the rollover current year income statement perspective and iron curtain year end balance sheet perspective approaches 
the financial statements would require adjustment when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material  after considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors 
at the effective date of adoption january  for us  the misstatements considered immaterial under a registrant s previous method of quantifying misstatements but material under sab may be corrected as an accounting change by adjusting opening retained earnings rather than being included in the current year statement of operations 
the adoption of sab no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a threshold of more likely than not for recognition of tax benefits of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides related guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  and disclosure 
differences between the amounts recognized in the financial statements prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
as required  we will adopt fin on january  prior to the adoption of fin  our policy was to recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only if it was probable that the position would be sustained 
accordingly  we anticipate that certain accrued expenses for uncertain tax positions will be reversed upon adoption of fin due to the lower recognition threshold 
based on our analysis  we estimate that accrued expenses will decrease in the amount of  and retained earnings will increase by the same amount as of january  as a result of the adoption in fin in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position sfas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards  or sfas no

 fair value measurements  or sfas sfas clarifies the definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for us beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas adoption on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at december  which are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and our interest income fluctuates as interest rates change 
due to the short term nature of our investments in money market funds  the carrying values of our cash equivalents approximate their fair value at december  our short term investments in commercial paper  certificates of deposit and government notes are carried at fair value 
the carrying amount  which approximates fair value  and the annualized weighted average nominal interest rate of our short term investment portfolio at december   was approximately million and  respectively 
a one percent change in the interest rate would have resulted in a  impact to interest income for the year ended december
