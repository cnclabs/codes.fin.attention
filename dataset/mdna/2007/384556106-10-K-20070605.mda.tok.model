item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts in thousands  except per share data overview our corporate offices and production facilities are located in batavia  new york 
we have two wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  one located in the united kingdom and the other in china 
our current fiscal year  which we refer to as fiscal  began on april  and ended on march  we are a designer  manufacturer and worldwide supplier of ejectors  liquid ring pumps  condensers and heat exchangers 
the principal markets for our equipment are the petrochemical  oil refinery and electric power generation industries  including cogeneration and geothermal plants 
our equipment can also be found in diverse applications such as metal refining  pulp and paper processing  shipbuilding  water heating  refrigeration  desalination  food processing  pharmaceuticals  heating  ventilating and air conditioning 
highlights for fiscal include net income and income per diluted share for fiscal  were  and  including per diluted share in out of period research and development tax credits  respectively  compared with net income of  and income per diluted share of for fiscal net income for fiscal was the highest net income achieved in our seventy one year history 
this year s earnings beat our former record set in by 

table of contents net sales for the year of  were up compared with fiscal fourth quarter sales increased to  compared with  for fourth quarter fiscal orders placed with us in fiscal of  were up compared with the twelve month period ended march  this represents the greatest dollar value of orders we have ever received in a one year period 
backlog grew significantly to  on march  representing a increase compared with march  this is a historic high for our backlog 
gross profit and operating margins for fiscal were and compared with and  respectively  for the year ended march  cash and short term investments at year end fiscal were  which places us in an unprecedented opportunity to increase the longer term value of our company 
we believe the principal market drivers that have led to increased capital spending by our customers and that are contributing to our sales growth include global consumption of crude oil is estimated to expand significantly over the next decade 
it is generally believed that there is a shortage of global oil refining capacity 
known supplies of sweet crude oil are being depleted 
sour crude sources are identified and believed to be plentiful 
there is a differential in raw material prices for higher quality sweet and lower quality sour crude oil 
to lower production costs  many refineries are upgrading facilities in order to be able to process sour crude oil  which requires an upgrade of vacuum and heat transfer equipment 
the expansion of the middle class in asia is driving increasing demand for power and petrochemical products 
the high cost of natural gas in north america and europe is leading to the construction of new petrochemical plants in the middle east  where natural gas is plentiful and less expensive 
there is an increased need in certain regions for geothermal electrical power plants to meet increased electricity demand 
forward looking statements this report and other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by the forward looking statements

critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on all contracts with a planned manufacturing process in excess of four weeks which approximates direct labor hours using the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method is determined by comparing actual labor incurred to a specific date to our estimate of the total labor to be incurred on each contract 
contracts in progress are reviewed monthly  and sales and earnings are adjusted in current accounting periods based on revisions in the contract value and estimated material and labor costs at completion 
losses on contracts are recognized immediately when known 
revenue on contracts not accounted for using the percentage of completion method is recognized utilizing the completed contract method 
the majority of the contracts we enter into have a planned manufacturing process of less than four weeks and the results reported under this method does not vary materially from the percentage of completion method 
we recognize revenue and all related costs on the completed contract method upon substantial completion or shipment of products to the customer 
substantial completion is consistently defined as at least complete with regard to direct labor hours 
customer acceptance is required throughout the construction process and we have no further material obligations under the contract after the revenue is recognized 
the key estimate of percentage of completion accounting is total labor to be incurred on each contract and to the extent that this estimate changes  it may significantly impact revenue recognized in each period 
pension and postretirement benefits 
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions are reviewed annually and include the discount rate  long term expected rate of return on plan assets  salary growth  healthcare cost trend rate and other economic and demographic factors 
we base the discount rate assumption for our plans on moody s or citigroup pension liability index aa rated corporate long term bond yield rate 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets is based on the plan s asset allocation  historical returns and expectations as to future returns that are expected to be realized over the estimated remaining life of the plan liabilities that will be funded with the plan assets 
the salary growth assumptions are determined based on long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are based on historical cost and payment data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of the likely long term trends 
income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using current tax rates 
we evaluate available information about future taxable income and other possible sources of realization of deferred income tax assets and record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that represents our best estimates of the amounts of 
table of contents such deferred income tax assets that more likely than not will be realized 
at march  and  no valuation allowance was recorded 
results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated year ended march  net sales net income diluted income per share identifiable assets fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal were  a increase  as compared with  for fiscal fifty two percent of this increase came from greater export sales 
the growth in export sales primarily came from the middle east and asia and involved both petrochemical and refinery projects 
sales in all product categories eg  heat exchangers  ejectors  condensers  vacuum pumps and aftermarket increased compared with fiscal  but the greatest dollar value increases came from sales of ejectors  heat exchangers and vacuum pumps 
our heat exchanger products are heliflows  plate exchangers  desuperheaters and water heaters 
increased heat exchanger sales accounted for of the increased sales 
heat exchanger sales were led upward by heliflows and plate exchanger sales 
heat exchanger sales grew due to a broad based strategic effort  which included training  changing the supplier who provided the basic materials used to build plate exchangers  manufacturing efficiencies gained through the implementation of lean procedures  the introduction of software marketing tools and the addition of an expanded agency network 
increased ejector sales accounted for of the increased sales and were due to the increased activity we continue to see from the refinery industry for oil refinery upgrades and capacity expansion projects 
increased vacuum pump sales accounted for of the increased sales and came from domestic refinery applications 
the remaining increase in sales  compared with fiscal  came from single digit gains in the other products we sell 
we believe the demand for our products  and especially those applicable to the refinery sector  will continue to be strong at least through our fiscal year ending march   which we refer to as fiscal for additional information  see orders and backlog below 
our gross profit percentage ie  sales  less costs of sales  divided by sales for fiscal was compared with for fiscal gross profit percentage decreased primarily due to greater material costs in fiscal material costs  expressed as a percent of sales  were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
gross profit dollars increased compared with fiscal  as a result of greater sales volume 
although we project continued pressure on gross margins because of increasing labor and benefit costs and our longer term strategic decision to expand into new geographic markets  we believe gross profit margin percentages will increase in fiscal compared with fiscal we believe such increase will occur because we have been able to be more selective on orders we accept and realized benefits from productivity gains in manufacturing that expanded engineering and manufacturing capacity 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal were of sales compared to for fiscal the decline  expressed as a percentage of sales  was due to greater sales in the current fiscal year 
actual costs increased or compared with fiscal sg a expense increased due to the additional costs of our company in china 
interest expense was for fiscal compared with for fiscal interest expense decreased due to reduced debt and a reduction in the applicable interest rate under our banking facility on a year over year basis 

table of contents other expense for fiscal was compared with for fiscal other expense for the current year represented a provision made to cover the possible costs of an asbestos litigation suit currently in progress 
we estimate the range of the possible expense  including legal costs  to be to other expense for fiscal was incurred in conjunction with the settlement of litigation whereby we sued a foreign pump competitor that had adopted the name graham 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  such competitor agreed to discontinue using our name by the fall of in exchange for certain inventory items with a recorded amount plus packaging costs of we incurred in legal costs pertaining to this settlement 
other income for fiscal was compared with for fiscal royalty income of was earned under a license agreement we entered into in october that allows the licensee to use  market and sell specific products we manufacture 
future royalty income earned by us under this agreement will depend upon the sale of licensed products by the licensee 
in fiscal  our effective tax rate was compared with an effective tax rate of for fiscal the fiscal rate approximated the statutory rate 
the fiscal effective tax rate reflects the benefit of  in research and development r d credits 
the total credit recognized this fiscal represents qualifying expenditures for the fiscal years to remaining federal loss carryforwards  significantly reduced to eliminate current federal taxes in fiscal and  are projected to be fully utilized in fiscal tax planning strategies leading to r d credits recognized in the current year will be used to reduce current federal taxes payable in fiscal and after 
provided the r d tax credit is extended by congress beyond the current year and under the current formula  we expect the r d credit for engineering applications in those years to be in the range of to per annum 
net income for fiscal and was  and  respectively 
income per diluted share was  including for non recurring research and development tax credits  and for the respective periods 
fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal were  a increase  as compared with  for fiscal sixty seven percent of the growth in sales came from greater export sales 
fifty six percent of the increase in export sales came from sales to the middle east and were mostly for petrochemical projects 
increased sales to canada  for refinery and oil sands projects ie  projects involving a process whereby tar like sludgy heavy oil is extracted from sand  asia  for petrochemical projects  and mexico  for refinery applications  account for the remainder of the growth in export sales 
by product  condenser sales for fiscal increased over fiscal and ejector sales increased 
increased sales of condenser products were mostly a result of capacity expansion projects in the petrochemical market 
increased ejector sales were primarily a result of oil refinery upgrades and expansion activities 
the latter activity was largely due to the growing utilization of lower quality sour crude oil instead of higher quality sweet crude oil as the core raw material for refinery processes  as well as compliance with environmental regulations in numerous countries related to clean fuels and capacity additions 
increases in capacity in the petrochemical sector were being driven by greater worldwide demand for  and consumption of  oil and natural gas by products 
gross profit percentage for fiscal was compared with for fiscal gross profit dollars increased  compared with fiscal the improvement in gross profit margin in fiscal was due to greater sales volume and selling price increases 
sg a expenses were of sales for fiscal  as compared with for fiscal actual expenses for fiscal increased or  compared with fiscal  primarily as a result of increased travel for sales activities  variable compensation expense  the addition of sales personnel in europe and china to support long term sales growth opportunities and consulting costs for employee training and costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of interest expense was for fiscal and for fiscal year interest expense decreased due to reduced bank borrowings 
other expense for fiscal was this expense was incurred in conjunction with the settlement of litigation whereby we sued a foreign pump competitor that had adopted the name graham 
pursuant to the 
table of contents settlement agreement  the competitor agreed to discontinue using our name by the fall of in exchange for certain inventory items with a recorded amount plus packaging costs of we incurred in legal costs pertaining to this settlement 
other expense in fiscal of  related to transitioning two senior executives 
under the terms of an agreement reached with our former president and chief executive officer  he was retained by us as an independent consultant through november  for an estimated cost  including retainer and certain benefits  of another senior executive was transitioned in january the term of the agreement reached with this former executive included salary continuation for twelve months and certain medical benefits for thirty six months  for an estimated cost of costs accrued as of march  to recruit and relocate executive replacements for such transitioned senior executives resulted in of expense 
there was no other income for fiscal other income of  for fiscal resulted from a settlement of a contract dispute over cancellation charges 
the settlement of this matter ended a complaint we filed in april in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging breach of contract by a customer and a counterclaim filed by the customer seeking specific performance of the contract or monetary damages 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was  as compared with for fiscal fiscal year s rate approximated the statutory rate

fiscal compared with fiscal net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was  compared with  for fiscal cash generated from elements of the income statement in fiscal eg  net income plus depreciation  deferred income tax provision and other non cash income statement cash flow items increased compared with fiscal from march  operating working capital ie  current assets less cash  investments and current liabilities was reduced and at march and march  respectively  as a result of continuous improvements lowering our cash conversion cycle 
average operating working capital  expressed as a percent of sales  for fiscal and was and  respectively 
reducing operating working capital in fiscal generated cash flow of compared with  for fiscal this comparative decrease resulted in the decrease in cash from 
table of contents operations for the current year 
the smaller decrease in operating working capital in fiscal primarily pertained to accounts receivable balances at march   and of   and  respectively 
these wide differences in accounts receivable balances on the year end dates reflected the progress billing stages of contracts at these particular points in time and not the continuous improvement in faster cash collection time  which from march has been reduced at march and march by and  respectively 
customer deposits eg  advance payments in excess of customer s inventory in progress increased  at march  compared with march  and for fiscal compared with fiscal due to our ability to accelerate progress payment billings 
see inventories under note to consolidated financial statements on page for additional information on contracts in progress at march  compared with march  we invest net cash generated from operations in excess of cash held for near term needs in marketable securities 
investments are us government instruments  generally with maturity periods of to days

capital expenditures for fiscal are projected to be  and to consist largely of continuing plant productivity and information technology enhancements 
on june   we increased our credit facility with bank of america  na from  to  we expanded our credit capacity based on our expectations of future working capital needs to finance business growth  largely resulting from an expected increase in major capital investment projects overseas requiring both standby letters of credit and anticipated greater working capital needs 
on september   we amended our credit facility to provide for issuance of bank guarantees for the benefit of our chinese subsidiary 
on march   we amended our credit facility to reduce borrowing costs under our facility by an additional twenty five basis points to prime minus basis points when the total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio under the agreement is met 
borrowings under our banking facility are secured by all of our assets 
borrowings and standby letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility on march  were and  respectively 
our borrowing rate as of march  was the bank s prime rate minus basis points  or 
we believe that cash generated from operations  combined with our investments and available financing capacity under our credit facility  will be adequate to meet our cash needs for the immediate future 
orders and backlog orders for fiscal were  compared with  for fiscal  an increase of 
orders represent communications received from customers requesting us to supply products and services 
although order demand is currently strong for all of our products  the increase in orders for fiscal over fiscal primarily resulted from increases in ejector orders 
ejector orders increased  in fiscal compared with fiscal and accounted for of the total order increase 
the increased ejector activity is largely due to major capital investment projects in the refinery sector worldwide 
heat exchanger orders  lead by heliflows  accounted for of the fiscal order increase 
other orders for product categories eg  condensers  pumps and aftermarket 
table of contents were about the same dollar values when compared with fiscal in aggregate down 
export orders were up  or  compared with fiscal the increase in export orders reflects the strong asian economies  particularly in the refinery sector  and the strong petrochemical markets in the middle east 
backlog was  at march   compared with  at march   a increase 
backlog is defined as the total dollar value of orders received for which revenue has not yet been recognized 
all orders in backlog represent orders from our traditional markets in established product lines 
approximately of orders currently in backlog are expected to be converted to sales within twelve months 
approximately of our backlog can be attributed to equipment for refinery project work  to chemical and petrochemical projects  and to other industrial or commercial applications 
we believe that the continuing demand from the refinery sector for our products is being driven by the shortages of refinery capacity resulting from increased global usage of oil 
contingencies and commitments we have been named as a defendant in certain lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos contained in our products 
we are a co defendant with numerous other defendants in these lawsuits and intend to vigorously defend against these claims 
the claims are similar to previous asbestos lawsuits that named us as a defendant 
such previous lawsuits either were dismissed when it was shown that we had not supplied products to the plaintiffs places of work or were settled by us for amounts below expected defense costs 
neither the outcome of these lawsuits nor the potential for liability can be determined at this time 
from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to legal proceedings and potential claims 
as of march   we were unaware of any additional pending litigation matters 
in may  we completed the formation of a wholly owned chinese subsidiary located in suzhou and committed to invest an aggregate of  over a two year period 
through march  we have invested  in our chinese subsidiary

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed are foreign currency exchange rates  and equity price risk related to our long term incentive plan 
the assumptions applied in preparing the following qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding foreign currency exchange rate and equity price risk are based upon volatility ranges experienced by us in relevant historical periods  our current knowledge of the marketplace  and our judgment of the probability of future volatility based upon the historical trends and economic conditions of the markets in which we operate 
foreign currency international consolidated sales for fiscal were of total sales compared with for fiscal operating in markets throughout the world exposes us to movements in currency exchange rates 
currency movements can affect sales in several ways  the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies 
business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified 
in addition  cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to us dollars 
in each of the fiscal years  and  we had no sales for which we were paid in foreign currencies 
at certain times  we may enter into forward foreign currency exchange agreements to hedge our exposure against potential unfavorable changes in foreign currency values on significant sales contracts negotiated in foreign currencies 

table of contents we have limited exposure to foreign currency purchases 
in fiscal years  and  our purchases in foreign currencies represented  and  respectively  of the cost of products sold 
at certain times  we may utilize forward foreign currency exchange contracts to limit currency exposure 
forward foreign currency exchange contracts were not used in fiscal or  and as of march  and  we held no forward foreign currency contracts 
equity price risk our long term incentive plan provides for awards of share equivalent units seus for our non employee directors based upon the performance of our common stock 
seus are valued at fair market value  thereby exposing us to equity price risk 
upward adjustment to market value is limited to a per unit if at the valuation date the fair market value was less than per unit or b the fair market value at the valuation date if the fair market value on that date was greater than per unit 
gains and losses recognized due to market price changes are included in results of operations 
based upon the plan provisions and seus outstanding at march  and  and an per share market price  a change in the year end common stock market price would positively or negatively impact income before income taxes as follows year ended march  dollar amounts in thousands increase decrease increase decrease assuming required net income targets are met  certain awards would be provided  and based upon a market price of per share  a change in the stock price would positively negatively impact income before income taxes in future years ending march as follows dollar amounts in thousands increase decrease increase decrease
