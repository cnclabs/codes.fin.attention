as such  the units of accounting are based on each individual product and service sold  and revenue is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value for each individual product and service is based on separate individual prices of these products and services

contracts the company recognizes revenue in its government segment using the guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
the company s contract revenues generated by the government segment result primarily from contract services performed for the us government under a variety of cost plus fixed fee  time and material and fixed price contracts 
revenue on cost plus fixed fee contracts is recognized based on allowable costs for labor hours delivered  as well as other allowable costs plus the applicable fee 
revenue on time and material contracts is recognized by multiplying the number of direct labor hours delivered in the performance of the contract by the contract billing rates and adding other direct costs as incurred 
revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized as labor hours are delivered which approximates the straight line basis of the life of the contract 
the company s obligation under these contracts is to provide labor hours to conduct research or to staff facilities with no other deliverables or performance obligations 
anticipated losses on all contracts are recorded in full when identified 
unbilled accounts receivable are stated in the company s consolidated financial statements at their estimated realizable value 
contract costs  including indirect expenses  are subject to audit and adjustment through negotiations between the company and us government representatives 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of probable losses related to accounts receivable balances 
the establishment of allowances requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding probable losses on receivable balances 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and appropriate reserves have been established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
thus  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
inventories the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company uses certain estimates and judgments and considers several factors including product demand and changes in technology to provide for excess and obsolescence reserves to properly value inventory

 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed

 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority and will affect many companies reported results and their disclosures of uncertain tax positions 
the interpretation does not prescribe the type of evidence required to support meeting the more likely than not threshold  stating that it depends on the individual facts and circumstances 
the benefit recognized for a tax position meeting the more likely than not criterion is measured based on the largest benefit that is more than percent likely to be realized 
the measurement of the related benefit is determined by considering the probabilities of the amounts that could be realized upon ultimate settlement  assuming the taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant facts and including expected negotiated settlements with the taxing authority
