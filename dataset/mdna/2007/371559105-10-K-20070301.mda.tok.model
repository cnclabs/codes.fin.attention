table of contents non freight revenues we generate non freight revenues primarily through the following activities railcar switching  which includes intra plant switching revenues earned by providing services dedicated to the movement of railcars within industrial plants and intra terminal switching revenues earned for the movement of customer railcars from one track to another track on the same railroad 
fuel sales to third parties revenues earned by gwa in south australia from the sale of diesel fuel to other rail operators 
car hire and rental services charges paid by other railroads for use of our railcars 
demurrage and storage charges to customers for holding or storing railcars 
car repair services charges for repairing freight cars owned by others  either under contract or in accordance with aar rules 
in  and  non freight revenues constituted  and  respectively  of our total operating revenues with railcar switching representing  and respectively  of total non freight revenues 
for a comparison of non freight revenues for the years ended december   and  see discussion under item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
reportable segments as of and for the year ended december   we reported financial information for two reportable segments railroad operations excluding mexico and mexico operations 
for financial information with respect to each of our reportable segments  see note to our consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv  item of this annual report 
geographic information for financial information with respect to each of our geographic areas  see note to our consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv  item of this annual report 
traffic rail traffic shipped on our rail lines can be categorized as interline  local or overhead traffic 
interline traffic either originates or terminates with customers located along a rail line and is interchanged with other rail carriers 
local traffic both originates and terminates on the same rail line and does not involve other carriers 
overhead traffic passes over the line from one connecting rail carrier to another without the carload originating or terminating on the line 
unlike overhead traffic  interline and local traffic provide us with a more stable source of revenue  because this traffic represents shipments to and or from customers located along our rail lines and is less susceptible to competition from other rail routes or other modes of transportation 
in  revenues generated from interline and local traffic constituted approximately of our freight revenues 
seasonality of operations typically  we experience relatively lower revenues in the first and fourth quarters of each year as the winter season and colder weather in north america tend to reduce shipments of certain products such as construction materials 
in addition  due to adverse winter weather conditions  we also tend to incur higher operating costs during the first and fourth quarters 
we typically initiate capital projects in the second and third quarters when weather conditions are more favorable 
however  certain of our traffic  such as salt for road de icing  often benefits from particularly cold and inclement weather 

table of contents employees as of december   our railroads and industrial switching locations had  full time employees 
of this total   railroad employees are members of national labor organizations 
our railroads have contracts with these national labor organizations  five of which are currently in negotiations 
the railway labor act rla governs the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in the united states 
the rla establishes the right of railroad employees to organize and bargain collectively along craft or class lines and imposes a duty upon carriers and their employees to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain collective bargaining agreements 
le code canadien du travail  the federal workplace relations act and junta federal de conciliaci n y arbitraje govern the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in canada  australia and mexico  respectively 
the rla and foreign labor regulations contain detailed procedures that must be exhausted before a lawful work stoppage may occur 
we have also entered into collective employee bargaining agreements with an additional employees who are not represented by a national labor organization 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
safety our safety program involves all employees and focuses on the prevention of accidents and injuries 
operating personnel are trained and certified in train operations  the transportation of hazardous materials  safety and operating rules and governmental rules and regulations 
we also participate in safety committees of the aar  governmental and industry sponsored safety programs and the american short line and regional railroad association safety committee 
our reportable injury frequency ratio  measured as reportable injuries as defined by the federal railroad administration fra  per  man hours worked  was and in and  respectively 
insurance we maintain insurance coverage for losses arising from personal injury and for property damage in the event of derailments or other accidents or occurrences 
the liability policies have self insured retentions of up to million per occurrence 
in addition  we maintain excess liability policies that provide supplemental coverage for losses in excess of primary policy limits 
with respect to the transportation of hazardous commodities  our liability policy covers sudden releases of hazardous materials  including expenses related to evacuation 
personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under our liability policies 
the property damage policies have self insured retentions ranging from million to million  depending on the category of incident 
employees of our united states railroads are covered by the federal employers liability act fela  a fault based system under which claims resulting from injuries and deaths of railroad employees are settled by negotiation or litigation 
fela related claims are covered under our liability insurance policies 
employees of our industrial switching business are covered under workers compensation policies 
we believe our insurance coverage is adequate in light of our experience and the experience of the rail industry 
competition each of our railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving our customers  however  our railroads compete directly with other modes of transportation  principally highway competition from motor carriers and  on some routes  ship  barge and pipeline operators 
competition is based primarily upon the rate charged and the transit time required  as well as the quality and reliability of the service provided 
most of the freight we handle is interchanged with other railroads prior to reaching its final destination 
as a result  to the extent other rail carriers are involved in transporting a shipment  we cannot necessarily control the cost and quality of such service 
to the extent highway competition is involved  the effectiveness of that competition is affected by government policy with respect to fuel and other taxes  highway tolls and permissible truck sizes and weights 

table of contents to a lesser degree  we also face competition with similar products made in other areas  a kind of competition commonly known as geographic competition 
for example  a paper producer may choose to increase or decrease production at a specific plant served by one of our railroads depending on the relative competitiveness of that plant versus paper plants in other locations 
in some instances  we face product competition  where commodities we transport are exposed to competition from substitutes 
for example  our fuel oil traffic in mexico is used to generate electricity for a power grid where competition from natural gas generation is substantial 
in acquiring rail properties  we generally compete with other short line and regional railroad operators  and more recently with private equity firms operating in conjunction with short line rail operators 
competition for rail properties is based primarily upon price and the seller s assessment of the buyer s railroad operating expertise and financing capability 
we believe our established reputation as a successful acquirer and operator of short line rail properties  combined with our managerial and financial resources  effectively positions us to take advantage of acquisition opportunities 
regulation united states in addition to environmental laws  securities laws and other regulations generally applicable to many businesses  our us railroads are subject to regulation by the stb  the fra  federal agencies  including the department of homeland security and department of transportation  state departments of transportation  and some state and local regulatory agencies 
the stb is the successor to certain regulatory functions previously administered by the interstate commerce commission icc 
established by the icc termination act of  the stb has jurisdiction over  among other things  certain freight rates where there is no effective competition  extension or abandonment of rail lines  the acquisition of rail lines and consolidation  merger or acquisition of control of rail common carriers 
in limited circumstances  the stb may condition its approval of an acquisition upon the acquirer of a railroad agreeing to provide severance benefits to certain subsequently terminated employees 
the fra has jurisdiction over safety  which includes the regulation of equipment standards  track maintenance  handling of hazardous shipments  locomotive and rail car inspection  repair requirements  operating practices and crew qualifications 
canada st 
lawrence atlantic railroad quebec is a federally regulated railroad and falls under the jurisdiction of the canada transportation agency cta and transport canada tc and is subject to the railway safety act 
the cta regulates construction and operation of federally regulated railways  financial transactions of federally regulated railway companies  all aspects of rates  tariffs and services and the transferring and discontinuing of the operation of railway lines 
tc administers the railway safety act  which ensures that federally regulated railway companies abide by all regulations with respect to engineering standards governing the construction or alteration of railway works and the operation and maintenance standards of railway works and equipment 
quebec gatineau railway and huron central railway are subject to the jurisdiction of provincial governments of quebec and ontario  respectively 
provincially regulated railways only operate within one 
table of contents province and hold a certificate of fitness delivered by a provincial authority 
in the province of quebec  the fitness certificate is delivered by the minist re des transports du quebec  while in ontario  under the short line railways act  a license must be obtained from the registrar of short line railways 
construction  operation and discontinuance of operation are regulated  as well as railway services 
acquisitions of additional railroad operations in canada  whether federally or provincially regulated  may be subject to review under the investment canada act ica  a federal statute that applies to the acquisition of a canadian business or establishment of a new canadian business by a non canadian 
in the case of an acquisition that is subject to review  a non canadian investor must observe a statutory waiting period prior to completion and satisfy the minister responsible for the administration of the ica that the investment will be of net benefit to canada  considering certain evaluative factors set out in the legislation 
any contemplated acquisitions may also be subject to the competition act canada  which contains provisions relating to pre merger notification as well as substantive merger provisions 
australia in australia  regulation of rail safety is generally governed by state legislation and administered by state regulatory agencies 
gwa s assets are subject to the regulatory regimes governing safety in each of the states in which it operates 
regulation of track access is governed by overriding federal legislation with state based regimes operating in compliance with the federal legislation 
as a result  with respect to rail infrastructure access  gwa s australian assets are also subject to state based access regimes and part iiia of the trade practices act gwa s interstate access includes the standard gauge tracks in south australia  as well as connecting standard gauge tracks in victoria and the northern territory 
the interstate network is part of the larger standard gauge network linking all capital cities in australia from brisbane to perth  as well as broken hill in new south wales and alice springs in the northern territory 
certain parts of this larger standard gauge network that are not covered by the interstate network are governed by the various state access regimes and the national access regime 
mexico in mexico  the secretaria de comunicaciones y transporte sct has jurisdiction over  among other things policies and programs related to the railroad system  the granting of concessions  the regulation of the concessions and resolution of any issues regarding amendments or terminations to the concessions  the regulation of tariff application  and the imposition of sanctions when operators have not complied with the terms of a concession 
our mexican railroad operation  compa a de ferrocarriles chiapas mayab  sa de sa fccm  is also subject to the mexican foreign investments law  the federal law of economic competition and the law of railway services 
the foreign investments law governs the ownership of mexican railroads by foreign entities while the law of economic competition is an antitrust statute 
the law of railway services regulates the construction and maintenance of rail lines and rights of way and related operations  interconnection services and auxiliary services 

table of contents environmental matters our operations are subject to various federal  state  provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
in the united states  these environmental laws and regulations  which are implemented principally by the environmental protection agency and comparable state agencies  govern the management of hazardous wastes  the discharge of pollutants into the air and into surface and underground waters and the manufacture and disposal of certain substances 
similarly  in canada  these functions are administered at the federal level by environment canada and the ministry of transport and comparable agencies at the provincial level 
in mexico  these functions are administered at the federal level by the secretary of environment  natural resources and fisheries and the attorney general for environmental protection and by comparable agencies at the state level 
in australia  these functions are administered primarily by the department of transport at the federal level and by environmental protection agencies at the state level 
in mexico  fccm was awarded a year concession expiring in to operate certain railways owned by the government owned rail company 
under the terms of the concession agreement  the federal railway company remains responsible for remediation of all contamination that occurred prior to the execution date of the concession agreement 
the commonwealth of australia has acknowledged that certain portions of the leasehold and freehold land acquired from them contain contamination arising from activities associated with previous operators 
the commonwealth has carried out certain remediation work to meet existing south australian environmental standards 
there are no material environmental claims currently pending or  to our knowledge  threatened against us or any of our railroads 
in addition  we believe our railroads operate in material compliance with current environmental laws and regulations 
we estimate any expenses incurred in maintaining compliance with current environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or capital expenditures

table of contents item a 
risk factors our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks that could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed or forecast in our forward looking statements  including the risks described below and the risks identified in other documents that are filed or furnished with the sec 
general risks associated with our business if we are unable to consummate additional acquisitions or investments  we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully 
our growth strategy is based to a large extent on the selective acquisition  development and investment in rail properties  both in new regions and in regions in which we currently operate 
the success of this strategy will depend on  among other things the availability of suitable opportunities  the level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources  our ability to value acquisition and investment candidates accurately and negotiate acceptable terms for those acquisitions and investments  our ability to identify and enter into mutually beneficial relationships with venture partners  and the availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the new businesses 
if we are not successful in implementing our growth strategy  the market price for our class a common stock may be adversely affected 
we may need additional capital to fund our acquisitions 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to forego potential acquisitions  which would impair the execution of our growth strategy 
since  we have acquired interests in railroads  the majority of which were for cash 
as of december   we had undrawn revolver capacity of million and million of cash and cash equivalents available for acquisitions or other activities  net of approximately million of taxes payable to the australian government in related to the arg sale 
we intend to continue to review acquisition candidates and potential purchases of railroad assets and to attempt to acquire companies and assets that meet our investment criteria 
we expect that  as in the past  we will pay cash for some or all of the purchase price of any acquisitions or purchases that we make 
depending on the number of acquisitions or purchases and the prices thereof  we may not generate enough cash from operations to pay for the acquisitions or purchases 
we may  therefore  need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our acquisitions 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of our existing stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities  the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions and costs on our operations 
additional capital  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to forego potential acquisitions  which could impair the execution of our growth strategy 
our inability to integrate acquired businesses successfully or to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits could have adverse consequences to our business 
we have experienced significant growth through acquisitions and we expect to continue to grow through additional acquisitions 
acquisitions generally result in increased operating and administrative costs and  to the extent financed with debt  additional interest costs 
we may not be able to manage or integrate the acquired 
table of contents companies or businesses successfully 
the process of combining acquired businesses may be disruptive to our business and may cause an interruption or reduction of our business as a result of the following factors  among others loss of key employees or customers  possible inconsistencies in or conflicts between standards  controls  procedures and policies among the combined companies and the need to implement company wide financial  accounting  information technology and other systems  failure to maintain the quality of services that have historically been provided  integrating employees of rail lines acquired from class i railroads  governments or other entities into our regional railroad culture  failure to coordinate geographically diverse organizations  and the diversion of management s attention from our day to day business as a result of the need to manage any disruptions and difficulties and the need to add management resources to do so 
these disruptions and difficulties  if they occur  may cause us to fail to realize the cost savings  revenue enhancements and other benefits that we expect to result from integrating acquired companies and may cause material adverse short and long term effects on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
even if we are able to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations  we may not realize the full benefits of the cost savings  revenue enhancements or other benefits that we may have expected at the time of acquisition 
the expected revenue enhancements and cost savings are based on analyses completed by members of our management 
these analyses necessarily involve assumptions as to future events  including general business and industry conditions  the longevity of specific customer plants and factories served  operating costs and competitive factors  many of which are beyond our control and may not materialize 
while we believe these analyses and their underlying assumptions to be reasonable  they are estimates that are necessarily speculative in nature 
in addition  even if we achieve the expected benefits  we may not be able to achieve them within the anticipated time frame 
also  the cost savings and other synergies from these acquisitions may be offset by costs incurred in integrating the companies  increases in other expenses or problems in the business unrelated to these acquisitions 
many of our recent acquisitions have involved the purchase of stock of existing companies 
these acquisitions  as well as acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of a company may expose us to liability for actions taken by an acquired business and its management before the acquisition 
the due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies may not be sufficient to protect us from or compensate us for  actual liabilities 
in connection with our gp railroads and rail partners acquisitions  most of the representations made by the sellers  other than certain representations related to fundamental matters  such as ownership of capital stock  have expired  in the case of gp  or will expire on or before june  in the case of rail partners 
a material liability associated with an acquisition  especially where there is no right to indemnification  could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
because we depend on class i railroads and other connecting carriers for a majority of our operations  our operating results  financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if our relationships with these carriers deteriorate 
the railroad industry in the us and canada is dominated by seven class i carriers that have substantial market control and negotiating leverage 
in  approximately of our total carloads were interchanged with class i carriers 
a decision by any of these class i carriers to use alternate modes of transportation  such as motor carriers  or to cease certain freight movements  could have a material adverse effect on our operating 
table of contents results  financial condition and liquidity 
the quantitative impact of such a decision would depend on which class i carrier made such a decision and which of our routes and freight movements were affected 
our ability to provide rail service to customers in the us and canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to  among other matters  freight rates  revenue divisions  fuel surcharges  car supply  reciprocal switching  interchange and trackage rights 
deterioration in the operations of or service provided by  those connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers  would adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
class i carriers also have traditionally been significant sources of business for us  as well as sources of potential acquisition candidates as they divest branch lines to smaller rail operators 
we lease several railroads from class i carriers under long term lease arrangements  which collectively accounted for approximately of our revenues 
in addition  we own several railroads that also lease portions of the track or right of way upon which they operate from class i railroads 
failure of our railroads to comply with the terms of these leases and agreements in all material respects could result in the loss of operating rights with respect to those rail properties  which would adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
because we depend on class i carriers for our us and canadian operations  our operating results  financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if our relationships with those carriers deteriorate 
of our mexican revenues  approximately originated and terminated on fccm s railroad  while the remaining approximately of revenue depended on fccm s relationship with ferrosur sa de sa ferrosur  the connecting carrier 
to the extent that we experience service or other commercial disruptions with ferrosur  our ability to serve existing customers and expand our business will suffer 
in november  grupo mexico  the majority owner of ferrocarril mexicano sa de sa ferromex  which is one of the largest railroads in mexico and principally operates in the northern and western parts of mexico  announced that it intended to acquire ferrosur 
the transaction is facing a legal challenge by the mexican commission on competition  which rejected a similar transaction in in addition  kansas city southern de mexico  which operates between ferromex and ferrosur and in the north eastern part of mexico  has commenced legal proceedings to prevent the transaction from closing 
we are still evaluating the potential commercial impact of this transaction on fccm  which may result in increased costs to fccm or limitations on fccm s ability to access traffic originating or terminating on kcs mexico s network 
for additional information on our mexico operations  see the discussion under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview mexico 
on january   the stb issued a final rule on fuel surcharges that may adversely affect our revenues 
on january   the stb issued final rules governing fuel surcharges that require freight railroads to change the methodologies used to impose fuel surcharges on shippers 
the final rule provides that computing fuel surcharges as a percentage of the base rate for transportation is an unreasonable practice because it does not account for factors such as mileage and weight that correlate more closely with the amount of fuel actually consumed 
in addition  the final rule prohibits railroads from applying to the same movement both a fuel surcharge and a rate increase based on a cost index that includes a fuel cost component 
the new rule does not apply to exempt traffic or traffic moving under contract 
freight railroads have until april   to modify their fuel surcharge practices accordingly 
in the united states and canada  through our contractual relationships with certain class i railroads  we are partially compensated for increases in fuel costs through fuel surcharges 
the new rule may reduce the fuel surcharges shared with us by class i railroads  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
our operations are dependent on our ability to obtain railcars and locomotives from other providers 
in  approximately of our railcars were leased 
if the number of available railcars is insufficient or if the cost of obtaining these railcars increases  we might not be able to obtain replacement railcars on favorable terms  or at all  and shippers may seek alternate forms of transportation 
in addition  in some cases we use third party locomotives to provide transportation services to our customers 
without these third party locomotives  we would need to invest additional capital in locomotives 

table of contents we face competition from numerous sources  including those relating to geography  substitute products  other types of transportation and other rail operators 
each of our railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving our customers 
our railroads  however  compete directly with other modes of transportation  principally motor carriers and  on some routes  ship  barge and pipeline operators 
transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rights of way that are built and maintained by governmental entities  while we must build and maintain our network 
if the scope and quality of these alternative methods of transportation are materially increased or if legislation is passed providing materially greater opportunity for motor carriers with respect to size or weight restrictions  we could suffer a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are also subject to geographic and product competition 
for example  a customer could shift production to a region where we do not have operations or could substitute one commodity for another commodity that is not transported by rail 
in either case  we would lose a source of revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the extent of this competition varies significantly among our railroads 
competition is based primarily upon the rate charged  the relative costs of substitutable products and the transit time required 
in addition  competition is based on the quality and reliability of the service provided 
because approximately of our carloads involve interchange with another carrier  we have only limited control over the total price  transit time or quality of such service 
any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality of these alternative modes of transportation in the locations in which we operate or legislation granting materially greater latitude for other modes of transportation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
it is difficult to quantify the potential impact of competition on our business  since not only each customer  but also each customer location and each product shipped from such location is subject to different types of competition 
we are subject to significant governmental regulation of our railroad operations 
the failure to comply with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are subject to governmental regulation with respect to our railroad operations and a variety of health  safety  security  labor  environmental and other matters by a significant number of federal  state and local regulatory authorities 
in the us  these agencies include the stb  the fra  federal agencies including the department of homeland security and the department of transportation and state departments of transportation 
in australia  we are subject to both commonwealth and state regulations 
our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  governments may change the regulatory framework within which we operate without providing us with any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on our operating results  financial condition or liquidity 
also  some of the regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses  permits and other authorizations  and we may not continue to be able to do so 
we could incur significant costs for violations of or liabilities under  environmental laws and regulations 
our railroad operations and real estate ownership are subject to extensive foreign  federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions to the air  discharges to waters  the handling  storage  transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases 
we may incur environmental liability from conditions or practices at properties previously owned or operated by us  properties leased by us and other properties owned by third parties  for example  properties at which hazardous substances or wastes for which we are responsible have been treated  stored  
table of contents spilled or disposed  as well as at properties currently owned by us 
under some environmental statutes  such liability may be without regard to whether we were at fault and may also be joint and several  whereby we are responsible for all the liability at issue even though we or the entity that gives rise to our liability may be only one of a number of entities whose conduct contributed to the liability 
environmental liabilities may arise from claims asserted by owners or occupants of affected properties or other third parties affected by environmental conditions for example  contractors and current or former employees seeking to recover in connection with alleged damages to their property or with personal injury or death  as well as by governmental authorities seeking to remedy environmental conditions or to enforce environmental obligations 
environmental requirements and liabilities could obligate us to incur significant costs  including significant expenses to investigate and remediate environmental contamination  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
some of our employees belong to labor unions  and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the united states  mexico  australia  canada and bolivia 
we are party to contracts with national labor organizations 
we are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to five of those agreements 
we have also entered into employee bargaining agreements with an additional employees who represent themselves 
gwa has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of its employees 
our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in  among other things  strikes  work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers 
if the unionized workers were to engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown or other employees were to become unionized or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and or higher ongoing labor costs  which  in either case  could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are also subject to the risk of the unionization of our non unionized employees  which could result in higher employee compensation and restrictive working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility 
in addition  work interruptions may be threatened  which could cause customers to seek other transportation alternatives  with a corresponding adverse financial impact 
if we are unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled workers  our operating results  financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected 
we believe that our success depends upon our ability to employ and retain skilled workers that possess the ability to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities 
the operation and maintenance of our equipment and facilities involve complex and specialized processes and often must be performed in harsh conditions  resulting in a high employee turnover rate when compared to many other industries 
in addition  our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers 
since  our annual average number of employees has increased from  to  for within the next five years  we estimate approximately of the current workforce will become eligible for retirement 
approximately three fourths of these workers hold key operating positions  such as conductors  engineers and mechanics 
in addition  the demand for workers with these types of skills has increased  especially from class i railroads  which can usually offer higher wages and better benefits 
a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force or an increase in the wage rates that we must pay or both 
if either of these events were to occur  our cost structure could increase  our margins could decrease and our growth potential could be impaired  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
as a common carrier by rail  we are required to transport hazardous materials  regardless of risk 
transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and property damage costs and compromise critical parts of our railroads 
legislation introduced in congress in 
table of contents early would give federal regulators increased authority to conduct investigations and levy substantial fines and penalties in connection with railroad accidents 
federal regulators also would be required to prescribe new regulations governing railroads transportation of hazardous materials 
if enacted  such legislation and regulations could impose significant additional costs on railroads 
additionally  regulations adopted by the department of transportation and the department of homeland security could significantly increase the costs associated with moving hazardous materials on our railroads 
further  certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning hazardous materials moving by rail within their borders 
some legislators have contemplated pre notification requirements for hazardous materials shipments 
if promulgated  such ordinances could require the re routing of hazardous materials shipments  with the potential for significant additional costs 
increases in our costs could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the occurrence of losses or other liabilities that are not covered by insurance or that exceed our insurance limits could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we have obtained for each of our railroads insurance coverage for losses arising from personal injury and for property damage in the event of derailments or other accidents or occurrences 
on certain of the rail lines over which we operate  freight trains are commingled with passenger trains 
unexpected or catastrophic circumstances such as accidents involving passenger trains or spillage of hazardous materials could cause our liability to exceed our insurance limits 
insurance is available from only a very limited number of insurers  and we may not be able to obtain insurance protection at our current levels or obtain it on terms acceptable to us 
in addition  subsequent adverse events directly and indirectly applicable to us may result in additional increases in our insurance premiums and or our self insured retentions and could result in limitations to the coverage under our existing policies 
the occurrence of losses or other liabilities that are not covered by insurance or that exceed our insurance limits could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
rising fuel costs could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses 
fuel costs for fuel used in operations were and of our operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fuel prices and supplies are influenced by factors beyond our control  such as international political and economic circumstances 
in the united states and canada  through certain of our contractual relationships with certain class i railroads  we are partially compensated for increases in fuel costs through fuel surcharges 
if class i railroads change their policies regarding fuel surcharges  if diesel fuel prices increase dramatically or if a fuel supply shortage were to arise from production curtailments  a disruption of oil imports or otherwise  these events could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the expiration of the short line tax credit on january   could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate 
on october   the american jobs creation act p 
l 
was signed into law 
the act provides a tax credit for class ii and class iii railroads against their federal income tax based on qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures the short line tax credit 
qualified expenditures include amounts incurred for maintaining track  including roadbed  bridges  and related track structures owned or leased by a class ii or iii railroad 
the credit is equal to of the qualified expenditures  subject to an annual limitation of  multiplied by the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased by the class ii or class iii railroad as of the end of their tax year 
the short line tax credit is applicable to tax years beginning after december   and before january   which includes calendar years  and in and  the short line tax credit lowered our effective tax rate by and  respectively 
if the short line tax credit is not extended and expires  the loss of the credit could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate and our reported earnings per share 

table of contents the loss of important customers or contracts may adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
our operations served more than customers in freight revenue from our largest freight revenue customers accounted for approximately of our revenues in as of december   four of our largest customers operated in the paper and forest products industry 
in  our largest freight revenue customer was a company in the paper and forest products industry  freight revenue from which accounted for approximately of our revenues in we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us  our connecting carriers and the customer 
these contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration 
these contracts establish price or  in the case of longer term contracts  a methodology for determining price  but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume and are not typically linked to the prices of the commodities being shipped 
in addition  gwa s largest freight customer  awb limited awb  is the subject of a government investigation and may lose its exclusive exporter status 
if awb loses its sole exporter status  under certain circumstances  it has the right to re negotiate the terms of the contracts with gwa  which could affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
substantial reduction in business with or loss of important customers or contracts could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
our results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy 
in any given year  we  like other railroads  are susceptible to changes in the economic conditions of the industries and geographic areas that produce and consume the freight we transport 
in addition  many of the goods and commodities carried by us experience cyclicality in their demand 
our results of operations can be expected to reflect this cyclicality  and because of the significant fixed costs inherent in railroad operations the impact could be material 
should an economic slowdown or recession occur in the countries in which we operate  the volume of rail shipments carried by us is likely to be affected 
our results of operations are susceptible to severe weather conditions and other natural occurrences 
we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions  including floods  fires  hurricanes  droughts  earthquakes and other natural occurrences 
for example mexico s revenues were reduced in and as a result of the impact of hurricane stan 
our minerals and stone revenues  which include salt  may be reduced by mild winters in the northeastern united states  which lessens demand for road salt 
our coal  coke and ores revenue may be reduced by mild winters in the united states  which lessens demand for coal 
gwa s revenues are expected to be reduced in as a result of the impact of drought conditions on the south australia grain harvest in bad weather and natural disasters  such as blizzards in eastern canada and the northeastern united states and hurricanes in mexico and the southeastern united states  could cause a shutdown or substantial disruption of operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  gwa derives a significant portion of its rail freight revenues from shipments of grain 
for the year ended december   grain shipments generated approximately of gwa s operating revenues 
a decrease in grain shipments as a result of adverse weather or other negative agricultural conditions could have a material adverse effect on gwa s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
even if a material adverse weather or other condition does not directly affect our operations  it can impact the operations of our customers or connecting carriers 
such weather conditions could cause our customers or connecting carriers to reduce or suspend their operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our 
table of contents results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
furthermore  our expenses could be adversely impacted by weather  including  for example  higher track maintenance and overtime costs in the winter in our new york pennsylvania and canada regions or possible track repairs related to washouts in mexico during its rainy season 
certain of our capital projects may be impacted by our relationships with government entities 
certain of our existing capital projects are and certain of our future capital projects may be  at least partially dependent on our ability to obtain government funding 
within the united states  during  we obtained funds for separate projects  which were partially funded by federal  state and municipal agencies 
these funds represented approximately of our total capital expenditures during government funding for our projects is limited  and there is no guarantee that budget pressure at the federal  state and local level or changing governmental priorities will not eliminate future funding availability 
in addition  competition for government funding from other short line railroads  class i railroads and other companies is significant  and the receipt of government funds is often contingent on the acceptance of contractual obligations that may not be strictly profit maximizing 
in certain jurisdictions  the acceptance of government funds may impose additional legal obligations on our operations  such as compliance with prevailing wage requirements 
our credit facilities contain numerous covenants that impose certain restrictions on the way we operate our business 
our credit facilities contain numerous covenants that impose restrictions on our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  create liens on our assets  make certain types of investments  repurchase shares or pay dividends  make expenditures for capital projects  merge or consolidate with others  make asset acquisitions other than in the ordinary course of business  dispose of assets or use asset sale proceeds  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
our credit facilities also contain financial covenants that require us to meet a number of financial ratios and tests 
our failure to comply with the obligations in our credit facilities could result in events of default under the credit facilities  which  if not cured or waived  could permit acceleration of our indebtedness  allowing our senior lenders to foreclose on our assets 
acts of terrorism or anti terrorism measures may adversely affect us 
our rail lines  port operations and other facilities and equipment  including rail cars carrying hazardous materials that we are required to transport under federal law as a common carrier  could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks 
any terrorist attack or other similar event could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  regulatory measures designed to control terrorism could impose substantial costs upon us and could result in impairment to our service  which could also adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 

table of contents we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 
the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment  personal injury  freight loss and other property damage and other matters 
for example  us job related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the federal employers liability act fela  which is applicable only to railroads 
fela s fault based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no fault worker s compensation system 
the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded 
any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss or property damage  personal injury and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance 
we have obtained commercial insurance for potential losses for third party liability and first party property damages 
specified levels of risk are retained by us 
insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or  if available  may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 
additional risks associated with our foreign operations we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 
some of our significant subsidiaries transact business in foreign countries  namely in australia  canada and mexico  and we have an equity investment in bolivia 
in addition  we may consider acquisitions or other investments in other foreign countries in the future 
the risks of doing business in foreign countries include adverse renegotiation or modification of existing agreements or arrangements with governmental authorities  adverse changes or greater volatility in the economies of those countries  adverse effects of currency exchange controls  adverse currency movements that make goods produced in those countries that are destined for export markets less competitive  adverse changes to the regulatory environment of those countries  adverse changes to the tax laws and regulations of those countries  restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings  the nationalization of the businesses that we operate  such as threatened nationalization in bolivia  the actual or perceived failure by us to fulfill commitments under concession agreements  the potential instability of foreign governments  including from domestic insurgency  and the challenge of managing a culturally and geographically diverse operation 
we may incur additional losses associated with the damage to our mexican railroad caused by hurricane stan 
in october  our mexican railroad operation  fccm was struck by hurricane stan with the most severe impact concentrated in the state of chiapas between the town of tonal and the guatemalan border 
approximately bridges were damaged or destroyed  and various segments of track were washed out  rendering portions of the rail line inoperable absent reconstruction 
as of september   the government had not committed adequate resources to fund the reconstruction project  and we did not intend to fund the project ourselves 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash charge of million pre tax million after tax in the third quarter of  reflecting the write down of non current assets and related effects of fccm 
as of december   fccm s remaining million of assets consisted of approximately million of non current assets  
table of contents primarily locomotives and freight cars  and approximately million of current assets  primarily receivables and inventory 
we are uncertain as to whether sufficient funds will be available from the mexican government to fund the reconstruction of the damaged rail line 
in addition  we are obligated under a guarantee arrangement of million in the event that our mexican subsidiary  gw servicios sa  is unable to fund future debt payments and its lenders accelerate the outstanding debt  million as of december   and demand immediate payment under the guarantee 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses from the mexican business and may record additional charges going forward  which could affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
for additional information on our mexican operations  see the discussion under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview mexico 
because some of our significant subsidiaries and affiliates transact business in foreign currencies and because a significant portion of our net income comes from the operations of our foreign subsidiaries  future exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect us and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods 
our operations in australia  canada and mexico accounted for  and of consolidated operating revenues  respectively  for the year ended december  the results of operations of our foreign entities are reported in the local currency the australian dollar  the canadian dollar and the mexican peso and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the us dollar can impact our results of operations 
the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future 
for instance  in the year ended december   the canadian dollar appreciated relative to the us dollar 
we cannot assure that we will be able to effectively manage our exchange rate risks  and the volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  because our financial statements are stated in us dollars  such fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods 
failure to meet concession commitments with respect to operations of our rail lines could result in the loss of our investment and a related loss of revenues 
we have entered into long term concession and or lease agreements with governmental authorities in mexico  bolivia and south australia 
these concession and lease agreements are subject to a number of conditions  including those relating to the maintenance of certain standards with respect to safety  service  price and the environment 
these concession and lease agreements also typically carry with them a commitment to maintain the condition of the railroad and to make a certain level of capital expenditures 
our failure to meet these commitments under the long term concession and lease agreements could result in the loss of those concession or lease agreements 
the loss of any concession or lease agreement could result in the loss of our entire investment relating to that concession or lease agreement and the related revenues and income 
australia s open access regime could lead to additional competition for gwa s business and decreased revenues and profit margins 
australia s open access regime could lead to additional competition for gwa s business  which could result in decreased revenues and profit margins 
the legislative and regulatory framework in australia allows third party rail operators to gain access to gwa s railway infrastructure and in turn governs gwa s access to track owned by others 
access charges are paid for access onto the track of other companies  and access charges under state and federal regimes continue to evolve because privatization of railways in australia is recent 
where gwa 
table of contents pays access fees to others  if those fees were increased  gwa s operating margins could be negatively affected 
in addition  if the federal government or respective state regulators were to alter a regulatory regime or determine that access fees charged to current or prospective third party rail freight operators by gwa did not meet competitive standards  then gwa s income from those fees could be negatively affected 
when gwa operates over track networks owned by others  including commonwealth owned and state owned networks  the owners of the network rather than the operators are responsible for scheduling the use of the tracks as well as for determining the amount and timing of the expenditures necessary to maintain the network in satisfactory condition 
therefore  in areas where gwa operates over tracks owned by others  it is subject to train scheduling set by the owners as well as the risk that the network will not be adequately maintained 
either risk could affect gwa 
gwa is subject to several contractual restrictions on its ability to compete 
gwa is subject to a a five year non compete in the state of western australia  the melbourne to adelaide corridor and certain areas within the state of new south wales historically served by arg  b a right of first refusal for the benefit of queensland rail on the sale of i gwa or a majority of the ownership of gwa  ii a number of high horse power locomotives and intermodal wagons owned or operated by gwa and iii assets of gwa s yard and facilities at port augusta  and c a restriction on hiring of arg employees who remain employed by arg after the closing 
these contractual restrictions may place limits on our ability to grow gwa s business  which could have a material adverse effect on gwa s operating results  financial condition and liquidity

overview we are a leading owner and operator of short line and regional freight railroads in the united states  canada  mexico and australia and own a minority interest in a railroad in bolivia 
in addition  we provide freight car switching and rail related services to industrial companies in the united states and australia 
in the first quarter of  there was a three for two split of our common stock in the form of a stock dividend 
all share and per share amounts in this form k reflect this stock split 
during  we experienced several individually significant transactions 
during the second and third quarters  we completed the arg sale and recognized a net gain totaling million million after tax and received approximately million in net cash proceeds 
we used some of this cash to reduce our outstanding debt obligations under our revolving credit facility 
in  we expect to remit approximately million in us and australian taxes related to this transaction 
even after the payment of these taxes we believe we have the strongest balance sheet in our history to pursue our growth and operating strategies 
we also recognized non cash charges during the second and third quarters of our share of asset impairment losses recorded by arg in connection with the gwa purchase resulted in a charge of million million after tax  and our assessment of the effects of political unrest in bolivia on our investment in oriental resulted in a charge of million million after tax during the second quarter of in the third quarter of  as a result of the uncertainty of the reconstruction of our hurricane damaged rail line in chiapas  mexico  we recorded a charge of million million after tax  reflecting the non cash write down of all of our mexican non current assets  other than rolling stock and other readily transferable assets  and related effects 
we are continuing efforts to resolve the situation in mexico 
from the standpoint of executing on our growth strategy in  we completed the gwa purchase for million and the acquisition of the chattahoochee bay railroad for million 
combined  these operations provided million in revenues and million in operating income to our consolidated income statement in in addition  we commenced a million infrastructure improvement project including approximately million in government grants to meet the projected capacity needs of a customer s new container terminal in portsmouth  va  which is expected to be complete in july our revenues increased million in as a result of growth from existing operations same railroad growth as well as the contribution from acquisitions 
same railroad growth is an important indicator of our performance as it is a measure of our ability to increase revenues from our existing operations 
same railroad revenues and total revenues increased and  respectively  in when compared with the increase in same railroad revenues was primarily due to higher average freight rates  higher fuel surcharges and favorable exchange rate movements 
growth in same railroad revenues provided million or of the year over year growth in revenues in despite a favorable rate environment in  our results were negatively impacted by a number of industry and other factors 
lumber and forest products carloads decreased from to  primarily the result 
table of contents of the weaker housing market in the united states 
our pulp and paper products carloads were negatively impacted by class i railroad rate increases  which caused certain shippers to move traffic from rail to other modes of transportation  principally truck 
our minerals and stone products carloads were negatively impacted by reduced shipments of rock salt for ice control resulting from a relatively mild winter season in the northeast united states 
our coal carloads were also negatively impacted as a result of a relatively mild winter season 
overall  our net income was million  an increase of million over total revenues in were million  an increase of over our operations produced net cash flow of million in  and we invested million in property and equipment  net of proceeds from government grants 
we expect to receive million in funding from third parties in related to capital expenditures 
outlook for in  we expect the favorable rail pricing environment in the united states and canada will continue  but that the rate increases may moderate from levels experienced in aggregate carload volumes in north america are anticipated to be in line with levels 
we will recognize the positive impact of a full year of operation of gwa in  versus only seven months in  offset by reduced grain traffic in south australia due to drought conditions 
we will also experience continued operating losses in mexico in due to the line closure in chiapas caused by hurricane stan 
although the arg sale occurred in  the payment of taxes to the australian government related to the transaction totaling approximately million is not required until accordingly  we anticipate a corresponding reduction in our cash balances in as a result of making timely payment of these taxes 
to the extent we repurchase shares of our common stock in  our cash balances will further decline 
australia effective june   we and our partner  wesfarmers limited wesfarmers  completed the sale of the western australia operations and certain other assets of arg to queensland rail and babcock brown limited arg sale 
as a result of the sale  we recognized a million net gain  including a million gain from the cumulative translation of the foreign currency investment and related equity earnings in arg into us dollars since in connection with the arg sale  we also incurred million of net transaction related expenses  of which million related to management bonuses and stock option awards 
simultaneous with the arg sale  we purchased wesfarmers ownership of the remaining arg operations  which are principally located in south australia  for approximately million gwa purchase collectively  australian transactions 
this business  which is based in adelaide  south australia  was renamed genesee wyoming australia pty ltd gwa and is a owned subsidiary 
the gwa purchase was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
however  because we previously held a share of these assets through our ownership interest in arg  we applied a step method to the allocation of value among the assets and liabilities of gwa 
because the million purchase price for wesfarmers share was lower than of the book value arg had historically recorded on these assets  we recorded a non cash loss of million million  net of tax  representing our share of the impairment loss recorded by arg  which was included in equity income of international affiliates in the consolidated statement of operations in the year ended december  gwa commenced operations on june  accordingly  of the value of gwa s net assets million was included in our consolidated balance sheet since june  
table of contents while we expect to complete our allocation of the value of gwa among respective assets and liabilities during the second quarter of  the following table sets forth our preliminary allocation dollars in thousands cash other current assets property and equipment deferred tax asset total assets current liabilities long term liabilities total liabilities net assets south america on april   due to the heightened political and economic unrest and uncertainties in bolivia  we advised the creditors of genesee wyoming chile sa gwc  which indirectly owns a interest in oriental  that we were ceasing our efforts to restructure the million non recourse debt obligation of gwc  through which we maintain a partial equity interest in ferroviaria oriental sa oriental 
in may  the bolivian government issued a presidential decree ordering the nationalization of bolivia s oil and gas industry 
in june  the government announced that it intended to nationalize  take a partial ownership stake in or restructure the operations of other local companies  including oriental 
as a result of the government s stated intentions  we believed it was likely that oriental s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity will be adversely affected 
accordingly  we determined during the second quarter of that our million equity investment in oriental which represents a indirect interest in oriental  including the portion held though gwc  had suffered an other than temporary decline in value 
based on our assessment of fair value  the investment was written down by million with a corresponding charge to earnings in the year ended december  as of june   we discontinued equity accounting for the remaining million investment in oriental 
we will account for this investment under the cost method in future periods and will record income to the extent that we receive cash dividends from oriental 
historically oriental s results of operations have not had a material impact on our results of operations 
we will continue to monitor the political situation in bolivia 
mexico in october  our mexican railroad operation  fccm was struck by hurricane stan with the most severe impact concentrated in the state of chiapas between the town of tonal and the guatemalan border 
approximately bridges were damaged or destroyed  and various segments of track were washed out 
since then  fccm has been working with the secretaria de comunicaciones y transporte sct and other mexican government agencies to develop a reconstruction plan for the damaged portion of the railroad 
in july  fccm received a letter from the sct indicating that the sct intended to fund of the million expected cost to rebuild the damaged rail line subject to certain conditions 
after july  fccm began negotiating a formal agreement with the sct and undertook project design work 
however  actions taken by the mexican national water commission cna and other mexican government agencies in the storm damaged area significantly increased the cost of the rail line reconstruction project and made the timetable to completion uncertain 
as of september   the government had not committed adequate resources to fund the project  and we did not intend to fund the additional costs 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash charge of million pre tax million after tax in the third quarter of  reflecting the write down of non current assets and related effects of fccm 
fccm s remaining 
table of contents million of assets as of december   consisted of approximately million of non current assets  primarily locomotives and freight cars  and approximately million of current assets  primarily receivables and inventory 
as a result of the impairment charges and expected further operating losses  absent a clear change from the current expectations  future capital expenditures in mexico  if any  will be expensed as incurred 
the exception would be capital expenditures for investments in rolling stock or other readily transferable assets 
on september   our mexican subsidiary  gw servicios sa servicios was unable to fund its principal and interest payment of million due under its loan agreements 
in november  we made this payment on servicios behalf under a corresponding guarantee arrangement  which in turn reduced our guarantee by the same amount 
in the event servicios is unable to fund future payments  the lenders to the mexican operations will have the right to accelerate the outstanding debt and commence actions to i collect on the entire outstanding balance under the loan agreements approximately million or ii exercise their rights to the collateral pledged under the loan agreements  including fccm s rolling stock and our shares in fccm and servicios 
if the lenders accelerate the outstanding debt  they may demand immediate payment of million from us pursuant to a guarantee 
neither payment defaults by servicios  nor any action taken by the lenders to collect under the loan agreements  will result in a default under our other outstanding debt obligations 
we anticipate servicios will not be able to meet its debt service obligations in if the lenders demand from us the amount of the debt service due in  or any amount up to the million  we will be obligated to fund the amount demanded 
we are engaged in a number of actions seeking resolution of the situation in mexico 
however  we expect to continue to incur operating losses from the mexican business and may record additional charges going forward 
in addition  despite any previous agreements with the sct and other government agencies  we are uncertain as to whether sufficient funds will be available from the mexican government to fund the reconstruction of the damaged rail line 
in mexico  we have initiated a dialogue with the representatives for the new calderon administration to resolve the issues concerning our mexican railroads 
because the administration assumed office in december  it is too early to determine the outcome of these discussions 
as a result of the changing economic circumstances of our mexican operations as compared to our other businesses  we have presented our mexican business as a separate segment in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  beginning july  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information

fcrd commenced operations on april  results of operations when comparing our results of operations from one reporting period to another  you should consider that we have historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to one time freight moves  weather related impacts such as hurricanes  floods  drought or snow  customer plant expansions and shut downs  sales of land and equipment  accidents and derailments 
in periods when these events occur  results of operations are not easily comparable to other periods 
recent transactions including acquisitions in the us and australia  the divestiture of our equity investment in australia and the write down of non current assets in our mexico operations have changed our operations 
because of variations in the structure  timing and size of these transactions our operating results in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to our operating results in other reporting periods 
certain of our railroads have commodity shipments that are sensitive to general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate  including paper products in canada  chemicals in the united states  cement in mexico and grain in australia 
however  shipments of other commodities are less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected by other factors  such as inventory levels maintained at a customer power plant coal and winter weather salt

the following table sets forth the impact of foreign currency translation on reported operating revenues dollars in thousands operating revenues year ended december  as reported currency translation impact revenues excluding currency impact us operating revenues canada operating revenues australian operating revenues mexico operating revenues total operating revenues critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management uses its judgment in making significant estimates in the areas of recoverability and useful life of assets  as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates described below with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to such estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
property and equipment we record property and equipment at historical cost and we record acquired railroad property at the allocated cost 
we capitalize major renewals or improvements  but routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred 
we credit or charge to operating expense gains or losses on sales or other dispositions 
we depreciate our property and equipment on the straight line method over the useful lives of the road property years and equipment years 
the following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of our major classes of property and equipment property estimated useful life buildings leasehold improvements years or life of lease bridges tunnels culverts years track property years equipment computer equipment years locomotives freight cars years vehicles mobile equipment years signals crossing equipment years track equipment years other equipment years 
table of contents we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that our long lived tangible assets may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of such asset in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred 
if we identify impairment on an asset  we would report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the fair value of such asset  as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances 
we closely monitor our assets in foreign operations where fluctuating currencies and unsettled economic conditions can create greater uncertainty 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 we recorded a million write down of our mexican subsidiary s property and equipment in the third quarter of as a result of the uncertainty of the reconstruction of a hurricane damaged rail line in chiapas 
as a result of the impairment charges and expected further operating losses  absent a clear change from the current expectations  future capital expenditures in mexico  if any  will be expensed as incurred 
the exception would be capital expenditures for investments in rolling stock or other readily transferable assets 
grants grants received from governmental agencies are recorded as long term liabilities when received and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation expense over the same period during which the underlying purchased assets are depreciated 
in addition to government grants  customers occasionally provide fixed funding of certain track rehabilitation or construction projects to facilitate our service over that track 
these improvements are not recorded in our financial statements unless the fixed funding exceeds the actual cost of rehabilitation or construction in which case we record a gain in the current period 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we account for our business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
we allocate the total cost of an acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values 
as part of this allocation process  we identify and attribute values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired 
these determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions  including those with respect to future cash flows  discount rates and asset lives  and therefore require considerable judgment 
these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods 
we review the carrying values of identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill at least annually to assess impairment  since these assets are not amortized 
additionally  we review the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever such events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we assess impairment by comparing the fair value of an intangible asset or goodwill with its carrying value 
the determination of fair value involves significant management judgment 
impairments are expensed when incurred 
specifically  we test for impairments in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

we perform our annual impairment test as of november th of each year and in no impairment was recognized for the year ended december  for intangible assets  the impairment test compares the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible assets exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
for goodwill  a two step impairment model is used 
we first compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  goodwill would be considered impaired and we would then record the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value 

table of contents amortizable intangible assets sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
requires us to perform an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators  as set forth in sfas no 
 are present 
we have amortizable intangible assets in the united states valued as customer relationships or contracts and previously had one amortizable intangible asset in mexico related to a concession agreement with the secretaria de comunicaciones y transporte 
as a result of the uncertainty of the reconstruction of the hurricane damaged line in chiapas  we wrote down the amortizable intangible asset in mexico for million in the third quarter of the intangible assets in the united states are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected economic longevity of the customer relationship  the facility served or the length of the customer contract 
derailment and property damages  personal injuries and third party claims we maintain insurance  with varying deductibles up to million per incident for liability and up to million per incident for property damage  for claims resulting from train derailments and other accidents related to our railroad and industrial switching operations 
accruals for fela claims by our railroad employees and third party personal injury or other claims  limited when appropriate to the applicable deductible  are recorded in the period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable 
these estimates are updated in future periods as information develops 
pensions and other post retirement benefits we use third party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits opeb for union and non union employees of two us subsidiaries 
in order to apply actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions 
the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate applied to future liabilities and expected future rate of return on pension assets 
for other postretirement benefits  the critical assumptions are the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rate 
we evaluate our critical assumptions annually  and our assumptions are based on the following factors as of december  discount rate is based on a review of long term bonds  including published indices 
the discount rate determined on that basis was expected return on plan assets is based on an assumed long term asset rate of return of 
health care cost trend rate is based on historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions and is assumed to be in graded ratably to over a seven year period 
on september   the fasb issued sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of sfas   and r 
the standard  among other things  requires companies to recognize the funded status of defined benefit plans in the consolidated financial statements 
recognize as a component of other comprehensive income the previously unrecognized prior service costs credits  gains losses and transition assets obligations that arise during the year and are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost 
as of december   we adopted the standard  and the adjustment to our balance sheet increased the liability for pension and postretirement benefits by approximately million and decreased accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately million  net of tax  with the difference recorded as a deferred tax asset

sfas r requires us to measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognized compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
prior to adoption of sfas r  we accounted for our stock based compensation plans under accounting principles board apb opinion  under which no compensation cost had been recognized and disclosed the pro forma expense for basic and diluted earnings per share as if stock based compensation had been compiled under sfas the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model and straight line amortization of compensation expense over the requisite service period of the grant 
two assumptions in the black scholes pricing model that require management judgment are the expected life and expected volatility of stock 
the expected life is based on historical experience and is estimated for each grant 
the expected volatility of stock is based on actual volatility and adjusted to reflect future expectations 
during the fourth quarter of  we voluntarily conducted and completed a comprehensive internal review of our historical stock option practices for stock option grants made during the period from our initial public offering on june  through the third quarter of  under the direction of the independent members of the board of directors 
the review found no evidence of any intentional wrongdoing by our executive officers  members of our board of directors or any other employees 
however  the internal review identified certain administrative procedural deficiencies that resulted in unintentional accounting errors 
these errors  principally related to situations where  as of the grant date approved by the compensation committee  an aggregate number of stock options to be granted was approved and the exercise price for the stock options was established  but the allocation of those stock options to certain individual employee recipients was not finalized until a later date 
as a result  we determined that later measurement dates for accounting purposes for those individuals grants should have been used  and we determined that non cash stock based compensation expense was understated by a cumulative amount of million million after tax  with million related to grants to the general population of employees  none of whom were executive officers 
under the direction of the audit committee of the board of directors  the results of the internal review were evaluated by outside counsel  who concurred with the findings 
for the year ended december   compensation cost of million pre tax  or million after tax  from amortizing stock options reduced earnings by per share 
of the million compensation cost  million was attributable to stock options awards that were part of the transaction bonuses related to the arg sale in the quarter ended june   and million was attributable to the unintentional accounting errors associated with the use of incorrect measurement dates for certain grants  as discussed above 
the total compensation cost related to non vested stock option awards not yet recognized of million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of one year 
the total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated income statement for share based compensation related to stock options was million for the year ended december  amortization expense for the restricted stock shares was million  and the total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards was million for the year ended december  total unrecognized compensation cost for non vested restricted stock shares and restricted stock units of million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
income taxes we accounted for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no

sfas no 
requires a balance sheet approach for the financial accounting and reporting of deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between book and tax basis assets and liabilities  as well as available income tax credits and net operating loss carry forwards 
in our consolidated balance sheets  these deferred obligations are classified as current or non current based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting 
a deferred income tax obligation or benefit 
table of contents that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting  including deferred income tax assets related to carry forwards  are classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference as of the end of the year 
no provision is made for the us income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries because it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries 
if the earnings were to be distributed in the future  those distributions may be subject to us income taxes appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
the amount of undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries as of december  was million 
we had net operating loss carry forwards from our mexican operations in and of million and million  respectively 
the mexican losses  for income tax purposes  primarily relate to the immediate deduction of a portion of the purchase price paid for the fccm operations and interest expense incurred in the holding company  servicios 
these loss carry forwards will expire between and in  we recorded a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of our mexican subsidiaries 
the developments in negotiating the reconstruction plan discussed in note in item of this report have resulted in our belief that the mexican subsidiaries will not generate enough taxable income to realize the benefit of their deferred tax assets 
accordingly  a valuation allowance of million was recorded in our effective tax rate for the year ended december   inclusive of valuation allowance was compared with in the year ended december  management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances to which we may be currently subject  and the financial statements accurately reflect management s best estimate of our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows for the years presented 
other uncertainties our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks that could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in our forward looking statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we actively monitor our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks and use derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of certain of these risks 
we use derivatives only for purposes of managing risk associated with underlying exposures 
we do not trade or use instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on the interest rate or exchange rate fluctuations alone  nor do we use instruments where there are not underlying cash exposures 
complex instruments involving leverage or multipliers are not used 
we manage our hedging positions and monitor the credit ratings of counterparties and do not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance 
management believes that our use of derivative instruments to manage risk is in our best interest 
however  our use of derivative financial instruments may result in short term gains or losses and increased earnings volatility 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk results from issuing variable rate debt obligations  since an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows 
the table below provides amounts outstanding and corresponding interest rates for our fixed and variable rate debt and our use of interest rate swaps to mitigate increases in interest rates 
principal amount of debt and interest rate swaps dollars in thousands december  fixed rate debt weighted average fixed interest rate variable rate debt swapped to fixed rate debt weighted average fixed interest rate unswapped variable rate debt weighted average variable interest rate total long term debt weighted average interest rate 
table of contents table assumptions variable interest rates the table presents variable interest rates based on us and canadian libor rates as of december  
the borrowing margin is composed of a weighted average of for debt under our us and canadian credit facilities  for our series c senior notes and for debt related to our mexican operations 
interest rate swaps the table presents dollar amounts outstanding under interest rate swaps as of december   in which we have swapped a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
the table also presents the average fixed interest rate under these swaps  which is equal to our fixed pay rates to counterparties plus our borrowing margin 
interest rate sensitivity based on the table above  assuming a one percentage point increase in market interest rates  annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by approximately million 
foreign currency risk the functional currency of our mexican operations is the mexican peso  while the debt obligations are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we face exchange rate risk if the mexican peso were to depreciate relative to the us dollar  thereby generating lower us dollar equivalent cash and earnings to pay the principal and interest on the debt 
debt related to our canadian operations is denominated in canadian dollars 
therefore  foreign currency risk related to debt service payments generally does not exist at our canadian operations 
however  in the event that this debt service is funded from our us operations  we may face exchange rate risk if the canadian dollar were to appreciate relative to the us dollar  thereby requiring higher us dollar equivalent cash to settle the outstanding debt  which is due in us dollar denominated principal and projected interest obligations of mexican peso denominated operations dollars in thousands thereafter total principal payments interest payments total principal and interest payments are due on march and september of each year 
based on month us libor as of december   plus a borrowing margin of or  as appropriate for the period 
foreign currency hedge on february   we entered into two foreign currency forward contracts with a total notional amount of million to hedge a portion of our investment in of the equity of arg 
the contracts  which expired in may  were extended to june   and protected a portion of our investment from exposure to large fluctuations in the us australian dollar exchange rate 
at expiration  excluding the effects of fluctuations in the exchange rate on our investment  we recorded a loss of million from these contracts  which is included in the net gain on sale of arg 

table of contents sensitivity of foreign currency to debt service payments if the value of the mexican peso were to weaken percentage points relative to the us dollar while mexican denominated earnings and cash flows remained constant  then it would be equivalent to the mexican operations being required to support an additional million in debt service payments 
sensitivity of foreign currency translation gwi s mexican operations are held through two subsidiaries  servicios and fccm 
servicios is the obligor of the loan agreements with the ifc and fmo  while fccm is the operating company 
fccm is owned by servicios and by us 
servicios is owned by us and by the ifc 
fccm historically has made debt service payments on behalf of servicios 
when fccm makes a payment on servicios behalf  servicios provides fccm with a u 
s 
dollar denominated note for the amount of the payment 
these notes bear interest at the same spread over libor as the underlying debt to the ifc and fmo  currently libor 
since fccm has the mexican peso as its functional currency  these notes are recorded on its balance sheet in mexican pesos 
when the mexican peso appreciates or depreciates relative to the us dollar  fccm records a non cash loss or gain  respectively  on the note as it is revalued 
as of december   the total amount due to fccm from servicios was million 
a one percentage point appreciation in the mexican peso relative to the us dollar from the december  exchange rate would result in a pre tax loss for fccm in the amount of million 
sensitivity to diesel fuel prices we are exposed to fluctuations in diesel fuel prices  since an increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in lower earnings and cash outflows 
in the year ended december   fuel costs for fuel used in operations represented of our total expenses 
as of december   we had not entered into any hedging transactions to manage this diesel fuel risk 
as of december   each one percentage point increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in a million increase in our annual fuel expense to the extent not offset by fuel surcharge
