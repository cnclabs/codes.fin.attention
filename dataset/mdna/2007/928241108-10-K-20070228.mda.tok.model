item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation background we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of products that address serious infectious diseases  with a focus on products used by physician specialists or in hospital settings 
we intend to grow through sales of our marketed product  vancocin hcl capsules  through the continued development of our product pipeline and through potential acquisition or licensing of products or acquisition of companies we have one marketed product and multiple product candidates in development 
we market and sell vancocin hcl capsules  the oral capsule formulation of vancomycin hydrochloride  in the us and its territories 
vancocin is a potent antibiotic approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  to treat antibiotic associated pseudomembranous colitis caused by clostridium difficile  or c 
difficile  and enterocolitis caused by s 
aureus  including methicillin resistant strains 
we are developing maribavir for the prevention and treatment of cytomegalovirus  or cmv  disease  and hcv for the treatment of hepatitis c virus  or hcv  infection 
we have licensed the us and canadian rights for a third product candidate  an intranasal formulation of pleconaril  to schering plough for the treatment of picornavirus infections 
we intend to continue to evaluate in licensing or other means of acquiring products in clinical development  and marketed products  in order to expand our current portfolio 
such products may be intended to treat  or are currently used to treat  the patient populations treated by physician specialists or in hospital settings 
while we were profitable from operations in both and  prior to the acquisition of vancocin  our first commercial product  we incurred historical losses 
historical losses resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development activities  write off of acquired technology rights  general and administrative expenses  interest payments on our outstanding debt and sales and marketing expenses 
executive summary during  we experienced the following business activities cmv presented positive results from a phase study of maribavir for the prevention of cmv infection in patients undergoing bone marrow stem cell transplantation 
initiated dosing in a phase clinical trial of maribavir for the prevention of cmv disease in patients undergoing bone marrow stem cell transplantation 
hcv with our partner wyeth completed enrollment and presented positive preliminary data from a phase b study that demonstrated the anti viral activity of hcv when dosed in combination with pegylated interferon 
began dosing in a phase study of hcv in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin 
vancocin finalized the qualification of osg norwich to manufacture vancocin finished product and gained approval of our third party manufacturing supply chain in the second quarter 
purchased all of our finished goods inventory using our third party manufacturer beginning in the third quarter  as we fully transitioned all vancocin manufacturing to our third party manufacturing supply chain 

table of contents learned of change by the fda s office of generic drugs  center for drug evaluation and research ogd on the approach regarding the conditions that must be met in order for a generic drug applicant to request a waiver of in vivo bioequivalence testing for vancomycin hydrochloride capsules 
we are vigorously opposing this attempt by the ogd to change the approach towards making bioequivalence decisions for copies of vancocin 
operating results increased working capital by million to million 
increased net sales to million  primarily resulting from price increases 
utilized vancocin finished goods manufactured pursuant to the november amendment to our manufacturing agreement with lilly  resulting in a lower gross product margin in the first half of the year 
averaged approximately gross product margin rate for vancocin for the full year 
increased development costs as we supported the progress of our cmv and hcv programs 
increased legal and consulting costs as we opposed ogd s attempt to change the bioequivalence requirements for generic copies of vancocin 
liquidity generated net cash from operating activities of million 
increased cash and cash equivalents and short term investments to million 
eliminated debt principal of million through redemption of the last of our subordinated convertible notes 
received million from wyeth for the purchase of common stock as we achieved an hcv proof of concept milestone 
during and going forward  we expect to face a number of challenges  which include the following the commercial sale of approved pharmaceutical products is subject to risks and uncertainties 
there can be no assurance that future vancocin sales will meet or exceed the historical rate of sales for the product  for reasons that include  but are not limited to  generic and non generic competition for vancocin and or changes in prescribing habits or disease incidence 
additionally  period over period fluctuations in net product sales are expected to occur as a result of wholesaler buying decisions or disease incidence 
we cannot assure you that generic competitors will not take advantage of the absence of patent protection for vancocin to attempt to develop a competing product 
we are not able to predict the time period in which a generic drug may enter the market 
on march   we learned that the ogd changed its approach regarding the conditions that must be met in order for a generic drug applicant to request a waiver of in vivo bioequivalence testing for copies of vancocin 
we are opposing this attempt 
however  in the event this change in approach remains in effect  the time period in which a generic competitor may enter the market would be reduced and multiple generics may enter the market  which would materially impact our operating results  cash flows and asset valuations 
we will face intense competition in acquiring additional products to expand further our product portfolio 
many of the companies and institutions that we will compete with in acquiring additional products to expand further our product portfolio have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities than we have  and substantially greater experience in conducting business development activities 
we may need additional financing in order to acquire new products in connection with our plans as described in this report 

table of contents the outcome of our clinical development programs are subject to considerable uncertainties 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in developing and ultimately commercializing any of our product candidates in the timeframes that we expect  or at all 
we can not assure you that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments or cash flows from vancocin sales will be sufficient to fund all of our ongoing development and operational costs over the next several years  that planned clinical trials can be initiated  or that planned or ongoing clinical trials can be successfully concluded or concluded in accordance with our anticipated schedule and costs 
moreover  the results of our business development efforts could require considerable investments 
our actual results could differ materially from those results expressed in  or implied by  our expectations and assumption described in this annual report on form k

results of operations years ended december  and in thousands for the year ended december  net product sales total revenues gross product margin operating income net income net income per share basic diluted the decrease in net income for resulted from the million change in income tax from a benefit in to a million expense in the increase in operating income resulted from increased gross margin  offset by the increased costs to support vancocin and our cmv and hcv development programs 
the year ended december  includes million share based compensation expense and million of costs associated with our opposition to the ogd s change in approach 
additionally  included million of license fee revenue 
revenues revenues consisted of the following in thousands for the year end december  net product sales license fees and milestones revenues total revenues revenue vancocin product sales our net product sales are solely related to vancocin 
we sell vancocin only to wholesalers who then distribute the product to pharmacies  hospitals and long term care facilities  among others 
our sales of vancocin 
table of contents are influenced by wholesaler forecasts of prescription demand  wholesaler buying decisions related to their desired inventory levels  and  ultimately  end user prescriptions  all of which could be at different levels from period to period 
during the year ended december   net sales of vancocin increased compared to the same period in primarily due to the impact of price increases during and we believe  based upon data reported by ims health incorporated  that prescriptions during the year ended december  exceeded prescriptions in the period by 
our comparative period is also impacted by a decrease in wholesalers inventory levels during in the first four months of  as compared to the period where wholesalers inventory levels increased 
approximately of our sales are to three wholesalers 
vancocin product sales are influenced by prescriptions and wholesaler forecasts of prescription demand  which could be at different levels from period to period 
during the second quarter of  we began receiving inventory data from two of our three largest wholesalers 
we do not independently verify this data 
based on this inventory data  we believe as of december   the wholesalers did not have excess channel inventory 
revenue license fee and milestone revenues license fee and milestone revenues primarily include the following in  the sale of inventory for million pursuant to the terms of our license agreement with schering plough for intranasal pleconaril 
in both and  amortization of approximately million related to payments received under our agreement with wyeth 
our license fee and milestone revenues result from collaborations of development stage products and currently vary greatly from period to period

cost of sales and gross product margin december  net product sales cost of sales gross product margin vancocin cost of sales includes the cost of materials and distribution costs 
our gross product margin rate net product sales less cost of sales as a percent of net product sales for vancocin increased in the year ended december  to from in the same period in this increase primarily results from the sale of units manufactured by osg norwich  which carry a lower inventory cost 
as part of our november amendment of our manufacturing agreement with lilly  we increased the amount of vancocin that lilly supplied to us  which increased our cost of sales in the first half of by million  as specific units were sold 
during the second half of  all of the finished product we purchased was produced by osg norwich 
as of june   lilly no longer manufactured finished product for us because our third party manufacturing supply chain was approved in the second quarter of and in july  we began receiving regular shipments of product produced by osg norwich 
our finished product that was sold in the second half of included product produced by both lilly and osg norwich 
as such  our gross product margin began to steadily improve during the second half of 
table of contents since units are shipped based upon earliest expiration date  our actual margins will be impacted by the cost associated with the specific units that are sold 
additionally  we may experience fluctuations in quarterly manufacturing yields and if this occurs  we would expect the cost of product sales of vancocin  and accordingly  gross product margin percentage  to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
further  if we enter into fee for service or inventory management agreements with wholesalers in future periods  the fees would negatively impact our gross product margins 
research and development expenses for each of our research and development programs  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include third party costs related to these programs such as contract research  consulting  cost sharing payments or receipts  and preclinical and development costs 
indirect expenses include personnel  facility  and other overhead costs 
due to recent advancements in our clinical development programs  we expect future costs to exceed current costs 
research and development expenses were divided between our research and development programs in the following manner for the years ended december  in thousands direct core programs cmv hcv vancocin c 
difficile direct non core programs common cold indirect development total direct expenses core development programs related to our cmv program  during the year we concluded analysis of data from our phase clinical trial with maribavir  which demonstrated that maribavir significantly reduces cmv reactivation in patients who had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation 
we initiated dosing in a phase study of maribavir in the prevention of cmv disease in allogeneic stem cell transplantation and continued conducting and analyzing data from various phase clinical trials 
we are also preparing for a second phase study of maribavir in solid organ transplant patients 
included in the cmv expenses in is million related to a milestone payment due to glaxosmithkline associated with the initiation of the phase study of maribavir  which was paid in february in  we were conducting one phase clinical study  completing enrollment for the phase clinical trial in november  and were conducting or analyzing data from various phase clinical trials with maribavir 
related to our hcv program  costs in primarily represent those paid to wyeth in connection with our cost sharing arrangement related to discovery for screening compounds against hcv 
in addition  in accordance with our cost sharing arrangement  during the year  we conducted a phase b clinical trial which demonstrated the antiviral activity of hcv in combination with pegylated interferon  and we began dosing in a phase study of hcv during  we initiated phase clinical trials with hcv wyeth pays a substantial portion of the collaboration s predevelopment and development expenses 
in addition  during the quarter ended march   we halted development on our former hcv lead product candidate  hcv related to our vancocin c 
difficile program  costs in related to research and development activities  including costs related to non toxigenic strains of c 
difficile 

table of contents direct expenses non core development programs we incurred minimal direct costs related to our common cold program licensed to schering plough 
indirect expenses these costs primarily relate to the compensation of and overhead attributable to our development team  which increased in to support our advancements in development programs 
marketing  general and administrative expenses marketing  general and administrative mg a expenses increased million in to million from million in the largest contributors to this increase were share based compensation expense million  general legal and consulting costs million and medical education costs million 
other contributors included corporate franchise taxes  business development costs and commercial related expenses  which collectively increased by million 
legal and consulting costs for the year ended december  include million of costs beginning in march related to our opposition to the attempt by the ogd regarding the conditions that must be met in order for a generic drug application to request a waiver of in vivo bioequivalence testing for copies of vancocin 
we anticipate that these additional legal and consulting costs will continue at this level  or possibly higher  in future periods as we continue this opposition 
intangible amortization and acquisition of technology rights intangible amortization is the result of the vancocin product rights acquisition in the fourth quarter of additionally  as described in our agreement with lilly  to the extent that we incur an obligation to lilly for additional payments on vancocin sales  we have contingent consideration 
we record the obligation as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the related intangible asset and a cumulative adjustment to the intangible amortization upon achievement of the related sales milestones 
contingent consideration and lilly related additional payments are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
intangible amortization for the years ended december  and were comparable at million and million respectively 
the comparatives are impacted by cumulative adjustments  which were million in and million in in march  as a result of ogd s change in approach relating to generic bioequivalence determinations  we reviewed the value of the intangible asset and concluded that there was no impairment of the carrying value of the intangible assets or change to the useful lives as estimated at the acquisition date 
additionally  on an ongoing periodic basis  we evaluate the useful life of these intangible assets and determine if any economic  governmental or regulatory event has modified their estimated useful lives 
this evaluation did not result in a change the life of the intangible assets during the year ended december  we will continue to monitor the actions of the ogd and consider the effects of our opposition efforts and the announcements by generic competitors or other adverse events for additional impairment indicators and we will reevaluate the expected cash flows and fair value of our vancocin related assets  as well as estimated useful lives  at such time 
other income expense change in fair value of derivative liability the change in fair value of derivative liability related to the senior convertible notes that were outstanding during  all of which were converted by july therefore  there is no impact in as it relates to  based upon relevant information available at that time  we estimated the fair value of the make whole provision contained within our senior notes using a monte carlo simulation model to be 
table of contents million  which included million at the time of conversion of the senior notes into senior convertible notes in january and million upon exercise of the initial investors purchase option in april this fair value of the make whole provision  which was recorded as a derivative liability  was adjusted quarterly for changes in fair value during the periods that the senior convertible notes were outstanding  with the corresponding charge or credit to change in fair value of derivative liability 
these adjustments resulted in a loss on the change in fair value of derivative liability of million for the year ended december  gain on sale of short term investments during  we sold our marketable securities investment in siga technologies  inc for a gain of million 
net loss gain on bond redemption on march   the company redeemed the remaining million principal amount of subordinated convertible notes for million 
this eliminated our long term debt that was outstanding at december  the charge of million related to this payment in the first quarter of  represents a premium of million and the write off of deferred finance costs of million at march  in  we recorded a million net gain on the repurchase of million of subordinated convertible notes for million 
the net gain is comprised of the gross gain of million less the write off of million of deferred finance costs 
interest income interest income for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
interest income increased due to an increase in investments  principally related to the cash received from the issuance of common stock in our december public offering  million related to the sale of equity to wyeth  and cash inflows from operating activities  and higher rates of return in as compared to interest expense in thousands for the year ended december  interest expense on subordinated convertible notes interest expense on senior notes interest expense on senior convertible notes amortization and write offs of finance costs amortization of debt discount beneficial conversion feature other interest total interest expense interest expense on notes includes interest on all our notes outstanding and decreased over due to varying principal amounts outstanding during the periods 
interest expense and amortization of finance costs in relates entirely to the subordinated convertible notes  which were redeemed on march  amortization of finance costs and debt discount in relates primarily to the senior convertible notes issued in january and april  which were fully converted to common stock during the year 

table of contents the beneficial conversion feature relates to the automatic conversions of the senior convertible notes in june and july and is the result of the fair value of the shares of common stock on the commitment date exceeding the stock value as defined by the auto conversion provisions 
in the third quarter of  we released the remaining liability associated with the auto conversion provisions as the likelihood of payment is remote  resulting in a credit to interest expense 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate was and benefit of for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the income tax amounts are not comparable to as we released a portion of our valuation allowance to establish deferred tax assets in in addition to federal and state income tax at statutory rates and the effects of various permanent differences included in all periods for which income tax expense is reported  our income tax expense of million for the year ended december  also includes the impact of provision to return adjustments and the impact of adjustments to state apportionment rates

revenues revenues consisted of the following in thousands for the years ended december  net product sales license fees and milestones revenues grant and other revenues total revenues revenue vancocin product sales in  vancocin sales commenced in november  upon our acquisition of the product from lilly 
the factors contributing to the level of net sales of vancocin in the year ended december  include a 
table of contents increase in prescriptions  as reported by a third party  over the period and the realization of the sales price increases announced in december  march and august additionally  we believe the net product sales were affected by wholesaler inventory restocking to normal levels during the first quarter of  resulting from lilly s product allocation during the third and fourth quarters of net sales of vancocin were million and million for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  driven by price increases and prescription demand 
prescriptions increased and for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  as compared to the same periods in additionally  while fourth quarter prescriptions decreased approximately from third quarter prescriptions  net sales of vancocin in the fourth quarter of increased over the third quarter of the prescription trend in the fourth quarter of compares favorably to the decrease experienced from the third to fourth quarter of this increase was due to the following factors the impact of the price increases announced in august and an increase in estimated wholesaler inventory to levels that we believe to be at the higher end of normal  partially offset by the fact that in the fourth quarter of  the unit mix sold between the two presentations of vancocin favored the lower priced presentation compared to the preceding quarter 
we can not predict future prescription demand with any certainty 
in the periods  net product sales were million for the three and twelve months ended december   which are not comparable to the periods as we acquired vancocin from lilly in november during and a portion of the quarter ended march   vancocin was sold under our transition services agreement with lilly  who was our only customer during the transition period 
the transition agreement was terminated in january  and upon the termination  we began selling directly to wholesalers 
approximately of our sales are to three wholesalers 
vancocin product sales are influenced by prescriptions and wholesaler forecasts of prescription demand  which could be at different levels from period to period 
as of december   we reviewed net sales under our revenue recognition policy and no deferrals were necessary 
this review also resulted in our determination that the estimated inventory held at the end of december by the three largest wholesalers  although increased from september  was within a normal range for vancocin 
revenue license fee and milestone revenue license fee and milestone revenue primarily includes the following in  the sale of inventory for million pursuant to the terms of our license agreement with schering plough for intranasal pleconaril

during  we had no similar activities 
direct non core programs in  we incurred minimal direct costs related to our common cold program 
in  all non core program direct expenses were related to the completion of phase clinical trials with the intranasal formulation of pleconaril  which was our only active product candidate in our non core programs 
the gross costs of million for the year ended december  were netted by a million credit from a revision of the estimated costs accrued for clinical development related to the oral formulation of pleconaril and a million credit resulted from a settlement of a disputed accounts receivable for shared development expenses for oral formulation of pleconaril 
in november  schering plough assumed responsibility for all future development and commercialization of pleconaril 
indirect expenses the decrease in expenses related to indirect development activities was due primarily to the reduction of headcount and costs that resulted from our january restructuring 
we had no discovery research costs in as we exited these activities in our january restructuring 
in  our indirect expenses related to our discovery research activities also included million in costs related to our january restructuring 
marketing  general and administrative expenses marketing  general and administrative mg a expenses of million decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the million decrease was primarily due to million of costs related to the january restructuring  million charge related to the exit of an operating lease in  and million of second quarter costs related to our terminated bond offering 
after considering these expenses  mg a increased by million primarily due to commercial and other personnel related expenses  partially offset by reduced facility costs 
intangible amortization and acquisition of technology rights intangible amortization is the result of the vancocin product rights acquisition in the fourth quarter of we had a valuation study performed by a third party  based on information provided by management  to determine the allocation of the estimated purchase price of the vancocin acquisition among the intangible assets acquired as well as their estimated amortization period 
intangible amortization was million for and million for the period includes million of cumulative amortization related to million contingent consideration 
as of december   there was no impairment of the carrying value of the intangible assets or change to the useful lives as estimated at the acquisition date

see note of the consolidated financial statements regarding the automatic conversion 
income tax benefit our effective income tax benefit rate was for the year ended december  our income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  includes million to record our deferred tax assets by reducing our valuation allowance 
this was necessary as we believe we will utilize a portion of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards  among other things 
additionally  we recorded income tax expense of million  based on a combined federal and state estimated annual effective tax rate of 
the estimated annual effective tax rate was based on our estimated taxable income for  which includes  among other things  the utilization of a portion of our available net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
liquidity we expect that our near term sources of revenue will arise from vancocin product sales and milestone and license fee payments that we may receive from wyeth and schering plough if agreed upon events under our agreements with each of these companies are achieved 
however  we cannot predict what the actual sales of vancocin will be in the future  the outcome of our effort to oppose the ogd s approach to bioequivalence determinations for generic copies of vancocin is uncertain  and there are no assurances that the events that require payments to us under the wyeth and schering plough arrangements will be achieved 
in addition  there are no assurances that demand for vancocin will continue at historical or current levels 
our ability to generate positive cash flow is also impacted by the timing of anticipated events in our cmv and hcv programs  including results from clinical trials  the results of our product development efforts  and variations from our estimate of future direct and indirect expenses 
while we anticipate that cash flows from vancocin  as well as our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  should allow us to fund substantially all of our ongoing development and other operating costs  we may need additional financing in order to expand our product portfolio 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
at december   the annualized weighted average nominal interest rate on our short term investments was 
overall cash flows during the year ended december   we generated million of net cash from operating activities  primarily from the cash contribution of vancocin  which includes the impact on net income and decreases in inventory as result of lower per unit costs  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements and accounts receivable 
partially offsetting these cash contributions is the impact of decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
we also used million of cash for investing activities  as we purchased short term investments 
our net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily from the march redemption of the subordinated convertible notes for million  which was partially offset by the million purchase of common stock by wyeth in the third quarter of related to a milestone 
operating cash inflows we began to receive cash inflows from the sale of vancocin in january we cannot reasonably estimate the period in which we will begin to receive material net cash inflows from our product candidates currently under development 
cash inflows from development stage products are dependent on several factors  including the achievement of milestones and regulatory approvals 
we may not receive milestone payments from 
table of contents any existing or future collaborations if a development stage product fails to meet technical or performance targets or fails to obtain the required regulatory approvals 
further  our revenues from collaborations will be affected by efforts of our collaborative partners 
even if we achieve technical success in developing drug candidates  our collaborative partners may not devote the resources necessary to complete development and commence marketing of these products  when and if approved  or they may not successfully market these products 
the most significant of our near term operating development cash inflows are as described below 
operating cash outflows the cash flows we have used in operations historically have been applied to research and development activities  marketing and business development efforts  general and administrative expenses  servicing our debt  and income tax payments 
bringing drugs from the preclinical research and development stage through phase  phase  and phase clinical trials and fda approval is a time consuming and expensive process 
because our product candidates are currently in the clinical stage of development  there are a variety of events that could occur during the development process that will dictate the course we must take with our drug development efforts and the cost of these efforts 
as a result  we cannot reasonably estimate the costs that we will incur through the commercialization of any product candidate 
however  due to recent advancements in our trials  we expect future costs to exceed current costs 
the most significant of our near term operating development cash outflows are as described under development programs 
development programs for each of our development programs  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include third party costs related to these programs such as contract research  consulting  cost sharing payments or receipts  and preclinical and clinical development costs 
indirect expenses include personnel  facility and other overhead costs 
additionally  for some of our development programs  we have cash inflows and outflows upon achieving certain milestones 
core development programs cmv program from the date we in licensed maribavir through december   we paid million of direct costs in connection with this program  including the acquisition fee of million paid to gsk for the rights to maribavir in september during  we expect maribavir related activities to include continued recruitment into the ongoing phase study in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant  as well as initiation of a phase study in patients who have received a liver transplant 
we will also continue to conduct phase clinical pharmacology studies to support the overall clinical development program 
based on the execution of phase clinical development studies  we expect our expenses in for the cmv program to be substantially higher than in we are solely responsible for the cost of developing our cmv product candidate 
should we achieve certain product development events  we are obligated to make certain milestone payments to gsk  the licensor of maribavir 
the million milestone related to the initiation of the phase study occurred in the third quarter of  was accrued as of december  and was paid in february therefore  it is excluded from the million described above 
hcv program from the date that we commenced predevelopment activities for compounds in this program that are currently active through december   we paid million in direct expenses for the predevelopment and development activities relating to such compounds 
these costs are net of contractual cost sharing arrangements between wyeth and us 
wyeth pays a substantial portion of the collaboration s predevelopment and development expenses 

table of contents during  the planned activities for our hcv product candidate  hcv  include completion of enrollment in a phase study of hcv when dosed in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin 
an additional cohort or cohorts may be added to the study at doses higher or lower than the current milligram bid dose to asses the dose response relationship 
depending on results of this study  wyeth and we may initiate one or more clinical studies in we have and expect to continue to conduct studies of hcv in combination with other antiviral compounds 
the results of the planned studies  along with other predevelopment activities performed during the year  will significantly impact the timing and amount of expenses we will incur related to this program in future periods 
in addition  discussions with the fda regarding these studies may impact the timing  nature and cost of future planned studies 
additionally  will continue to include costs associated with discovery activities as wyeth and we renew some limited preclinical screening activity 
in august  wyeth and we announced that data indicated that hcv achieved a proof of concept milestone under the companies agreements 
in connection with meeting the proof of concept milestone  wyeth purchased  shares of viropharma s common stock for a purchase price of million 
see notes and of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
this stock purchase represents the last of three stock purchases outlined in the companies agreements 
should we achieve certain additional product development events  wyeth is required to pay us certain cash milestones pursuant to terms of our collaboration agreement 
however  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in achieving these milestones 
vancocin and c 
difficile related we acquired vancocin in november and have spent approximately million in direct research and development costs related to vancocin or on related c 
difficile activities since acquisition 
during  we expect our research and development activities in the field of c 
difficile to increase significantly  primarily related to our rights to develop non toxigenic strains of c 
difficile for the treatment and prevention of cdad 
therefore  we expect direct costs to increase above levels 
direct expenses non core development programs common cold from the date that we commenced predevelopment activities for the intranasal formulation of pleconaril through december   we incurred million in direct expenses 
we have not incurred any significant direct expenses in connection with this program since  nor will we in the future  as schering plough has assumed responsibility for all future development and commercialization of pleconaril 
in november  we entered into a license agreement with schering plough under which schering plough has assumed responsibility for all future development and commercialization of pleconaril 
schering plough paid us an initial license fee of million in december and purchased our existing inventory of bulk drug substance for an additional million in january we will also be eligible to receive up to an additional million in milestone payments upon achievement of certain targeted regulatory and commercial events  as well as royalties on schering plough s sales of intranasal pleconaril in the licensed territories 
business development activities through december   we paid an acquisition price of million  paid million related to additional purchase price consideration tied to product sales see note of the consolidated financial statements and incurred million of fees and expenses in connection with the vancocin acquisition 
in addition  we intend to seek to acquire additional products or product candidates 
the costs associated with evaluating or acquiring any additional product or product candidate can vary substantially based upon market size of the product  the commercial effort required for the product  the product s current stage of development  and actual and potential generic and non generic competition for the product  among other factors 
due to the variability of the cost of evaluating or acquiring business development candidates  it is not feasible to predict what our actual evaluation or acquisition costs would be  if any  however  the costs could be substantial 

table of contents debt service requirements subordinated convertible notes on march   we redeemed the remaining million principal amount of subordinated convertible notes for million 
this eliminated all long term debt that was outstanding at december  see notes and of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our subordinated convertible notes 
contractual obligations future contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  are as follows in thousands contractual obligations total year or less years years more than years operating leases total this table does not include any milestone payments under our agreement with gsk in relation to our in licensed technology  as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known and the million milestone payable is accrued 
similarly  it does not include any additional payments due to lilly in connection with the vancocin acquisition  as the amount and timing of future additional payments are not determinable 
under the terms of the agreement with lilly  lilly is entitled to additional payments on net sales of vancocin through the additional payments to be paid to lilly are calculated as follows payment on net sales between million through payment on net sales between million no additional payments are due to lilly on sales of vancocin below or above the sales levels reflected in the above table 
we account for purchase price consideration as contingent consideration and will record an adjustment to the carrying amount of the related intangible asset and a cumulative adjustment to the intangible amortization upon achievement of the related sales milestones 
assuming the maximum threshold is met at the end of each year  the cumulative amortization adjustment would be million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
in the event we develop any product line extensions  revive discontinued vancomycin product lines injectable or oral solution  make improvements of existing products  or expand the label to cover new indications  lilly would receive an additional royalty on net sales on these additional products for a predetermined time period 
this table does not include various agreements that we have entered into for services with third party vendors  including agreements to conduct clinical trials  to manufacture product candidates  and for consulting and other contracted services due to the cancelable nature of the services 
we accrue the costs of these agreements based on estimates of work completed to date 
we estimate that approximately million will be payable in future periods under arrangements in place at december  of this amount  approximately million has been accrued for work estimated to have been completed as of december  and approximately million relates to future performance under these arrangements 
the table above does not include the operating lease associated with facility lease as it was terminated on january  when we finalized the purchase of the facility for million  which was paid in january however  as of december   we were leasing  square feet in a facility located in exton  pennsylvania for our marketing  development and corporate activities under an operating lease that would have expired in and had million in future rental obligations 
operating leases represent equipment leases 

table of contents capital resources while we anticipate that revenues from vancocin will continue to generate positive cash flow and should allow us to fund substantially all of our ongoing development and other operating costs  we may need additional financing in order to expand our product portfolio 
should we need financing  we would seek to access the public or private equity or debt markets  enter into additional arrangements with corporate collaborators to whom we may issue equity or debt securities or enter into other alternative financing arrangements that may become available to us 
financing we have an effective form s universal shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission for the potential additional issuance of up to approximately million of our securities 
the registration statement provides us with the flexibility to determine the type of security we choose to sell  including common stock  preferred stock  warrants and debt securities  as well as the ability to time such sales when market conditions are favorable 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  the terms and prices for these financings may be much more favorable to the new investors than the terms obtained by our existing stockholders 
these financings also may significantly dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 
if we raise additional capital by accessing debt markets  the terms and pricing for these financings may be much more favorable to the new lenders than the terms obtained from our prior lenders 
these financings also may require liens on certain of our assets that may limit our flexibility 
additional equity or debt financing  however  may not be available on acceptable terms from any source as a result of  among other factors  our operating results  our inability to achieve regulatory approval of any of our product candidates  our inability to generate revenue through our existing collaborative agreements  and our inability to file  prosecute  defend and enforce patent claims and or other intellectual property rights 
if sufficient additional financing is not available  we may need to delay  reduce or eliminate current development programs  or reduce or eliminate other aspects of our business 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies 
critical policies and practices are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our summary of significant accounting policies is described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
however  we consider the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements and that could impact our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows product sales product revenue is recorded upon delivery to the wholesaler  when title has passed  price is determined and collectibility is reasonably assured 
at the end of each reporting period  as part of an analysis of returns  utilizing our revenue recognition policy derived from the criteria of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 including statement of financial accounting standards no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists we analyze our estimated channel inventory and 
table of contents we would defer recognition of revenue on product that has been delivered if we believe that channel inventory at a period end is in excess of ordinary business needs and if we believe the value of potential returns is materially different than our returns accrual 
further  in connection with our analysis of returns  if we believe channel inventory levels are increasing without a reasonably correlating increase in prescription demand  we proactively delay the processing of wholesaler orders until these levels are reduced 
for the first time since acquiring vancocin in november  during the third and fourth quarters of  we delayed orders received from customers based on the knowledge that they were ordering in excess of retail demand  as they anticipated that we would be implementing a price increase 
we establish accruals for chargebacks and rebates  sales discounts and product returns 
these accruals are primarily based upon the history of vancocin  including both lilly and our ownership periods 
we also consider the volume and price of our products in the channel  trends in wholesaler inventory  conditions that might impact patient demand for our product such as incidence of disease and the threat of generics and other factors 
in addition to internal information  such as unit sales  we use information from external resources  which we do not verify  to estimate the channel inventory 
our external resources include prescription data reported by ims health incorporated and written and verbal information obtained from two of our three largest wholesaler customers with respect to their inventory levels 
chargebacks and rebates are the most subjective sales related accruals 
while we currently have no contracts with private third party payors  such as hmo s  we do have contractual arrangements with governmental agencies  including medicaid 
we establish accruals for chargebacks and rebates related to these contracts in the period in which we record the sale as revenue 
these accruals are based upon historical experience of government agencies market share  governmental contractual prices  our current pricing and then current laws  regulations and interpretations 
we analyze the accrual at least quarterly and adjust the balance as needed 
we believe that if our estimates of the rate of chargebacks and rebates as a percentage of annual gross sales were incorrect by  our operating income and accruals would be impacted by approximately million in the period of correction 
in the fourth quarter of  while continuing to monitor the implementation process of medicare part d and consistent with our normal process  we performed an analysis on the share of vancocin sales that ultimately go to medicaid recipients and result in a medicaid rebate 
as part of that analysis  we considered our actual medicaid historical rebates processed  total units sold and fluctuations in channel inventory 
as such  we reduced our rebates accrual related to the prior quarters of by approximately million 
while we anticipate that our medicaid rebate accrual should remain at this lower level based on actual experience since the implementation of medicare part d  the factors addressed above could ultimately result in a material impact on future periods 
product returns are minimal 
product return accruals are estimated based on vancocin s history of damage and product expiration returns and are recorded in the period in which we record the sale of revenue 
at each reporting period  we also compare our returns accrual balance to the estimated channel inventory to ensure the accrual balance is reasonable and within an acceptable range 
for example  if the estimated channel inventory is at a high level  we could be required to adjust our accrual upward 
we believe any adjustment would be immaterial 
discounts are related to payment terms and are fully accrued in the period in which we record the sale of revenue 
since our customers consistently take the payment discount  we do not believe that future periods will be materially impacted by a change in a previous discount accrual 
impairment of long lived assets we review our fixed and intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
such 
table of contents assumptions include  for example  projections of future cash flows and the timing and number of generic competitive entries into the market  in determining the undiscounted cash flows  and if necessary  the fair value of the asset and whether an impairment exists 
these assumptions are subjective and could result in a material impact on operating results in the period of impairment 
while we reviewed our intangible assets in march in light of the actions taken by the ogd  we did not recognize any impairment charges 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further information 
we will continue to monitor the actions of the ogd and consider the effects of our opposition actions and the announcements by generic competitors or other adverse events for additional impairment indicators and we will reevaluate the expected cash flows and fair value of our vancocin related assets at such time 
on an ongoing periodic basis  we evaluate the useful life of intangible assets and determine if any economic  governmental or regulatory event has modified their estimated useful lives 
while we reviewed the useful life of our intangible assets in march in light of the actions taken by the ogd  we did not change the useful life of our intangible assets during the year ended december  see note of the consolidated financial statements for further information 
short term investments we review our short term investments on a periodic basis for other than temporary impairments 
this review considers credit worthiness and our intent and ability to hold until maturity and is subjective as it requires management to evaluate whether an event or change in circumstances has occurred in that period that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
as of december   no unrealized losses are other than temporary 
share based employee compensation we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  sfas r effective january  the calculation of this expense includes judgment related to the period of time used in calculating the volatility of our common stock  the amount of forfeitures and an estimate of the exercising habits of our employees  which is also influenced by our insider trading policy 
changes in the volatility of our common stock or the habits of our employees could result in variability in the fair value of awards granted 
income taxes our annual effective tax rate is based on expected pre tax earnings  existing statutory tax rates  limitations on the use of tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax position 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  including but not limited to future projections of taxable income  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities  tax planning strategies and the progress of ongoing tax audits 
we recognize the benefit of tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on the income tax returns we file if such tax position is probable of being sustained 
settlement of filing positions that may be challenged by tax authorities could impact the income tax position in the year of resolution 
our current tax liability is presented in the consolidated balance sheet within income taxes payable 
at december   we had million of gross deferred tax assets  which included the effects of federal and state net operating loss nol carryforwards of million  capitalized research and development costs of million and other items of million 
these assets are offset by a million valuation allowance as our ability to estimate long term future taxable income with a high level of certainty is limited 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences becomes deductible or the nols and credit carryforwards can be utilized 
when considering the reversal of the valuation allowance  we consider the level of past and future taxable income  the utilization of the carryforwards and other factors 
revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to 
table of contents vary significantly from period to period 
should we further reduce the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets  a current year tax benefit will be recognized and future periods would then include income taxes at a higher rate than the effective rate in the period that the adjustment is made 
as our business evolves  we may face additional issues that will require increased levels of management estimation and complex judgments 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertain tax positions  fin to clarify the criteria for recognizing tax benefits under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and to require additional financial statement disclosure 
fin requires that we recognize in our consolidated financial statements  the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
we currently recognize the impact of a tax position if it is probable of being sustained 
the provisions of fin are effective for us beginning january   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
while we are currently evaluating the impact of fin on our financial statements upon adoption  we anticipate a reclassification of our deferred income taxes from our valuation allowance to an uncertain tax provision liability  the impact of which is expected to be immaterial to both operating results and our financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas that provides guidance on performing fair value measurements 
it does not require new fair value measurements  although it could change current practice for some companies 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  while we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our financial statements upon adoption  we do not anticipate a material impact on operating results or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities  that prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities 
this fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  while we are currently evaluating the impact of this fsp on our financial statements upon adoption  we do not anticipate a material impact on operating results or financial position 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our holdings of financial instruments are primarily comprised of a mix of us corporate debt  government securities and commercial paper 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we manage these funds accordingly 
our primary investment objective is the preservation of principal  while at the same time maximizing the generation of investment income 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in cash equivalents such as treasury bills and money market funds and fixed income securities such as us government and agency securities  municipal securities  taxable municipals  and corporate notes while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
historically  we have typically invested in financial instruments with maturities of less than one year 
the carrying amount  which approximates fair value  and the annualized weighted average nominal interest rate of our investment portfolio at december   was approximately million and  respectively 
a one percent change in the interest rate would have resulted in a million impact to interest income for the year ended december  
table of contents beginning in  we are also exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates  specifically the euro  for certain immaterial expenses 
we have used foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on forecasted transactions to reduce this exposure to the risk that the eventual net cash outflows  resulting from purchases from foreign testing sites  will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
the nominal amount of these forwards as of december  was million and the associated fair value was approximately  which is credited to research and development expenses
