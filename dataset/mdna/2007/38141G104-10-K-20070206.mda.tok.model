the increase in trading and principal investments reflected significantly higher net revenues in fixed income  currency and commodities ficc  equities and principal investments 
the increase in ficc reflected particularly strong performances across all major businesses 
during  ficc operated in an environment characterized by strong customer driven activity and favorable market opportunities 
the increase in equities primarily reflected significantly higher net revenues in our customer franchise business 
during  equities operated in a favorable environment characterized by strong customer driven activity  generally higher equity prices and favorable market opportunities  although volatility levels were generally low 
in ficc and equities  as a result of the favorable trading and investing opportunities for our clients and ourselves  we increased our market risk  particularly in equity products  to capitalize on these opportunities 
we grew our balance sheet as needed to support these opportunities as well as to support increased activity in securities services 
the increase in principal investments reflected a significant gain related to our investment in the ordinary shares of industrial and commercial bank of china limited icbc and higher gains and overrides from other principal investments  partially offset by a smaller  but still significant  gain related to our investment in the convertible preferred stock of sumitomo mitsui financial group  inc smfg 
the increase in investment banking was due to significantly higher net revenues in underwriting and financial advisory  as we benefited from strong client activity levels  reflecting favorable equity and financing markets  strong ceo confidence and growth in financial sponsor activity 
the increase in asset management and securities services was primarily due to higher assets under management and significantly higher incentive fees  as well as significantly higher global customer balances in securities services 
assets under management increased billion or to a record billion  including net asset inflows of billion during looking forward to  our investment banking backlog at the end of was at its highest level since 
in addition to potential growth in the businesses and geographic areas in which we currently operate  the expansion of the economies of china  india  russia and brazil  as well as those of the middle east offer new opportunities for us to increase our presence in those markets 
in investment banking  there is growth potential to broaden our client base by providing strategic and financing advice and capital to middle market companies 
we also see opportunities to advise governments and investors on the sale and purchase of public infrastructure assets 
in addition  we are building a private banking capability as part of our strategy to provide a full range of services to our private wealth management clients 
though we generated record operating results in  our business  by its nature  does not produce predictable earnings 
our results in any given period can be materially affected by conditions in global financial markets and economic conditions generally

return on average tangible common shareholders equity is computed by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly tangible common shareholders equity

table of contents statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in exchange for share based payments 
in the first quarter of  we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires that share based awards held by employees that were retirement eligible  including those subject to non compete agreements  be expensed in the year of grant 
in addition to expensing current year awards  prior year awards must continue to be amortized over the relevant service period 
therefore  our compensation and benefits expenses in included and  to a lesser extent  and will include both amortization of prior year share based awards held by employees that were retirement eligible on the date of adoption of sfas no 
r and new awards granted to those employees 
we believe that presenting our results excluding the impact of the continued amortization of these prior year share based awards increases the comparability of period to period operating results and allows for a more meaningful representation of the relationship of current period compensation to net revenues 
the following tables set forth a reconciliation of diluted earnings per common share  common shareholders equity and net earnings applicable to common shareholders  as reported  to these items excluding the impact of the continued amortization of these prior year share based awards held by employees that were retirement eligible on the date of adoption of sfas no

table of contents business environment as an investment banking  securities and investment management firm  our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally  both in the united states and elsewhere around the world 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by  among other factors  high global gross domestic product growth  stable geopolitical conditions  transparent and efficient capital markets  low inflation  high business and investor confidence and strong business earnings 
these factors provide a positive climate for our investment banking activities  for many of our trading businesses and for wealth creation  which contributes to growth in our asset management business 
although global short term interest rates rose to modest levels and yield curves continued to flatten in  economic conditions remained favorable  as global equity prices generally rose  core inflation was broadly contained and corporate activity strengthened 
for a further discussion of how market conditions can affect our businesses  see certain risk factors that may affect our business below as well as risk factors in part i  item a of the annual report on form k 
a further discussion of the business environment in is set forth below 
global 
after solid economic growth in  the global economy grew at a strong pace in  particularly during the first half of the year 
however  during the second half of the year  economic growth in the united states and japan showed some signs of deceleration  while the pace of growth in the eurozone economy appeared to strengthen 
corporate activity was very strong  as mergers and acquisitions and equity and debt underwriting volumes increased significantly compared with the us federal reserve continued to raise rates in the first half of the year  increasing its federal funds target rate by a total of basis points 
despite the increase in short term rates  fixed income markets were favorable as long term bond yields remained low and the credit environment remained strong 
oil prices remained high throughout the year  despite declining during our fourth quarter  but this did not appear to materially affect consumer spending or global growth 
in the currency markets  the us dollar weakened against most major currencies  as well as against such emerging market currencies as the brazilian real  chinese yuan and korean won 
united states 
the us economy grew at a strong pace during the year as financial conditions remained supportive of economic activity 
real gross domestic product rose by in the calendar year  driven principally by strength in the industrial sector  solid consumer expenditure growth and a strong labor market 
this growth occurred despite a decline in the housing market and residential investment 
after slowing modestly in the beginning of  the rate of inflation increased  particularly in the second quarter  as energy prices rose significantly 
measures of core inflation also accelerated  although they eased towards the end of the calendar year 
in response to the strong economic growth and rising inflation  the us federal reserve raised its federal funds target rate by basis points in each of its meetings in through june  bringing the rate to 
however  the federal reserve kept rates unchanged for the remainder of the year as the pace of growth moderated  reflecting a decline in the us housing market and the delayed effects of higher interest rates and energy prices 
despite the rise in short term interest rates  the year us treasury note yield ended the year only basis points higher at 
the dow jones industrial average  s p index and nasdaq composite index increased by  and  respectively  during our fiscal year 
europe 
the pace of economic growth in europe accelerated as real gross domestic product in the eurozone economy grew by approximately in the calendar year 
despite a higher euro  economic conditions in the eurozone countries improved throughout the year  and consumer sentiment began to improve as a result of lower unemployment levels and higher domestic demand 
after leaving rates unchanged for over two years  the european central bank raised interest rates by a total of basis points during our fiscal year  bringing its policy rate to 
in the united kingdom  real gross domestic product growth accelerated to approximately in the calendar year  primarily reflecting strong investment spending 
the bank of england increased interest rates by basis points to  after having reduced rates by basis points in 
table of contents long term bond yields in both the eurozone and the united kingdom ended our fiscal year modestly higher 
reflecting the improvement in economic growth  european equity markets increased significantly during our fiscal year 
asia 
japan s economy grew at a relatively strong pace for the second year in a row  with real gross domestic product increasing by approximately in the calendar year 
the recovery in private investment and domestic demand continued to drive much of the improvement in the first part of the year  while exports drove real gross domestic product growth toward the end of the calendar year 
the unemployment rate fell to in from in calendar the bank of japan ended its zero interest rate policy  which had been in place since early  and raised the target overnight call rate by basis points during our fiscal year 
the yield on year japanese government bonds increased slightly  ending our fiscal year up basis points 
despite slightly higher short and long term interest rates  financial conditions remained supportive of economic activity 
the yen appreciated slightly against the us dollar  but declined against most other major currencies  while the nikkei index increased during our fiscal year 
elsewhere in asia  china s real gross domestic product growth remained robust  with growth particularly reliant on net exports  as demonstrated by china s large current account surplus 
china continued to allow its currency to appreciate modestly  with evidence of acceleration during the second half of the calendar year  ending our fiscal year nearly higher against the us dollar 
other currencies in the region also strengthened against the us dollar  including the korean won  philippine peso and the taiwan dollar 
growth in india also remained strong  which  together with china  supported growth throughout the region 
equity markets across the region generally rose  with markets in china  india  hong kong  south korea and taiwan all posting significant gains during our fiscal year 
certain risk factors that may affect our business we face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses  including market  liquidity  credit  operational  legal and regulatory risks 
for a discussion of how management seeks to manage some of these risks  see risk management below 
a summary of the more important factors that could affect our business follows below 
for a further discussion of these and other important factors that could affect our business  see risk factors in part i  item a of the annual report on form k 
market conditions and market risk 
our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally  and these conditions may change suddenly and dramatically 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by  among other factors  high global gross domestic product growth  stable geopolitical conditions  transparent and efficient capital markets  low inflation  high business and investor confidence and strong business earnings 
unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions  which can be caused by outbreaks of hostilities or other geopolitical instability  declines in business confidence  increases in inflation  corporate  political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets  natural disasters or pandemics or a combination of these or other factors  have adversely affected  and may in the future adversely affect  our business and profitability in many ways  including the following we have been operating in a low interest rate market for the past several years 
increasing or high interest rates and or widening credit spreads  especially if such changes are rapid  may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses 
we have been committing increasing amounts of capital in many of our businesses and generally maintain large trading  specialist and investing positions 
market fluctuations and volatility may adversely affect the value of those positions  including  but not limited to  our interest rate and credit products  currency  commodity and equity positions and our merchant banking investments  or may reduce our willingness to enter into new transactions 
from time 
table of contents to time  we have incurred significant trading losses in periods of market turbulence 
conversely  certain of our trading businesses depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities  and decreases in volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect the results of these businesses 
industry wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and mergers and acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our revenues and  because we may be unable to reduce expenses correspondingly  our profit margins 
in particular  because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues are derived from our participation in large transactions  a decrease in the number of large transactions due to uncertain or unfavorable market conditions may adversely affect our investment banking business 
pricing and other competitive pressures have continued  even as the volume and number of investment banking transactions have increased 
in addition  the trend in the underwriting business toward multiple book runners and co managers handling transactions  where previously there would have been a single book runner  has adversely affected our business and reduced our revenues 
reductions in the level of the equity markets or increases in interest rates tend to reduce the value of our clients portfolios  which in turn may reduce the fees we earn for managing assets 
increases in interest rates or attractive conditions in other investments could cause our clients to transfer their assets out of our funds or other products 
even in the absence of uncertain or unfavorable economic or market conditions  investment performance by our asset management business below the performance of benchmarks or competitors could result in a decline in assets under management and in the incentive and management fees we receive as well as reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors 
concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market making  proprietary trading and investing  block trading  merchant banking  underwriting and lending businesses 
this risk may increase to the extent we expand our proprietary trading and investing businesses or commit capital to facilitate customer driven business 
for example  in recent years large blocks of securities have increasingly been sold in block trades rather than on a marketed basis  which increases the risk that goldman sachs may be unable to resell the purchased securities at favorable prices and may incur significant losses as a result 
moreover  because of concentration of risk  we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for others in the industry 
we also regularly enter into large transactions as part of our trading businesses 
the number and size of such transactions may affect our results of operations in a given period 
the volume of transactions that we execute for our clients and as a specialist or market maker may decline  which would reduce the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads 
in addition  competitive pressures and other industry factors  including the increasing use by our clients of low cost electronic trading  could cause a reduction in commissions and spreads 
in our specialist businesses  we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderly market  including by purchasing shares in a declining market 
this may result in trading losses and an increased need for liquidity 
weakness in global equity markets and the trading of securities in multiple markets and on multiple exchanges could adversely impact our trading businesses and impair the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
in addition  competitive pressures have been particularly intense in the context of block trades 
for a further discussion of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  see critical accounting policies goodwill and identifiable intangible assets below 

table of contents while we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques  those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes 
thus  we may  in the course of our activities  incur losses 
market volatility has been relatively low in recent years 
an increase in volatility would increase our measured risk  which might cause us to reduce our proprietary positions or to reduce certain of our business activities 
in such circumstances  we may not be able to reduce our positions or our exposure in a timely  cost effective way or in a manner sufficient to offset the increase in measured risk 
liquidity risk 
liquidity is essential to our businesses 
our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access secured and or unsecured debt markets  an inability to access funds from our subsidiaries  an inability to sell assets or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral 
this situation may arise due to circumstances that we are unable to control  such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us 
the financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to which we are a party are increasingly complex  as we employ structured products to benefit our clients and ourselves  and these complex structured products often do not have readily available markets to access in times of liquidity stress 
growth of our proprietary investing activities may lead to situations where the holdings from these activities represent a significant portion of specific markets  which could restrict liquidity for our positions 
further  our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time 
our credit ratings are important to our liquidity 
a reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position  increase our borrowing costs  limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain bilateral provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts 
under these provisions  counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with goldman sachs or require us to post additional collateral 
termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements 
for a discussion of the potential impact on goldman sachs of a reduction in our credit ratings  see liquidity and funding risk credit ratings below 
credit risk 
we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money  securities or other assets will not perform their obligations 
these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
we are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances 
in addition  a deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold could result in losses and or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes 
a significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results 
the amount and duration of our credit exposures have been increasing over the past several years  as has the breadth of the entities to which we have credit exposures 
as a clearing member firm  we finance our client positions  and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our clients 
in addition  we have experienced  due to competitive factors  pressure to extend and price credit at levels that may not always fully compensate us for the risks we take 
in particular  corporate clients sometimes seek to require credit commitments from us in connection with investment banking and other assignments 
although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries  countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns  default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee  particularly as new business initiatives lead us to transact with a broader array of clients  with new asset classes and in new markets 
in addition  concerns about  or a default by  one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems  losses or defaults by other institutions  which in turn could adversely affect goldman sachs 

table of contents operational risk 
shortcomings or failures in our internal processes  people or systems  or external events could lead to impairment of our liquidity  financial loss  disruption of our businesses  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
for example  our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies 
the transactions we process have become increasingly complex and often must adhere to client specific guidelines  as well as legal and regulatory standards 
despite the contingency plans and facilities we have in place  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located 
this may include a disruption involving electrical  communications  transportation or other services used by goldman sachs or third parties with which we conduct business 
legal and regulatory risk 
we are subject to extensive and evolving regulation in jurisdictions around the world 
substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against goldman sachs could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to goldman sachs  which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects 
firms in the financial services industry have been operating in a difficult regulatory environment 
we face significant legal risks in our businesses  and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high 
for a discussion of how we account for our legal and regulatory exposures  see use of estimates below 

table of contents critical accounting policies fair value the use of fair value to measure our financial instruments  with related unrealized gains or losses generally recognized immediately in our results of operations  is fundamental to our financial statements and is our most critical accounting policy 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
in determining fair value  we separate our financial instruments into three categories cash ie  nonderivative trading instruments  derivative contracts and principal investments included within the principal investments component of our trading and principal investments segment  as set forth in the following table financial instruments by category in millions as of november financial financial financial instruments sold  financial instruments sold  instruments but not yet instruments but not yet owned  at purchased  at owned  at purchased  at fair value fair value fair value fair value cash trading instruments derivative contracts principal investments total includes securities held by our bank and insurance subsidiaries  which are accounted for as available for sale afs under sfas no

represents an economic hedge on the unrestricted shares of common stock underlying our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg 
for a further discussion of our investment in smfg  see principal investments below 

table of contents cash trading instruments 
the following table sets forth the valuation of our cash trading instruments by level of price transparency cash trading instruments by price transparency in millions as of november financial financial financial instruments sold  financial instruments sold  instruments but not yet instruments but not yet owned  at purchased  at owned  at purchased  at fair value fair value fair value fair value quoted prices or alternative pricing sources with reasonable price transparency little or no price transparency total fair values of our cash trading instruments are generally obtained from quoted market prices in active markets  broker or dealer price quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
the types of instruments valued in this manner include us government and agency securities  other sovereign government obligations  liquid mortgage products  investment grade and high yield corporate bonds  listed equities  money market securities  state  municipal and provincial obligations  and physical commodities 
certain cash trading instruments trade infrequently and have little or no price transparency 
such instruments include certain corporate bank loans  mortgage whole loans and distressed debt 
we value these instruments initially at cost and generally do not adjust valuations unless there is substantive evidence supporting a change in the value of the underlying instrument or valuation assumptions such as similar market transactions  changes in financial ratios or changes in the credit ratings of the underlying companies 
where there is evidence supporting a change in the value  we use valuation methodologies such as the present value of known or estimated cash flows 
cash trading instruments we own long positions are marked to bid prices  and instruments we have sold but not yet purchased short positions are marked to offer prices 
in certain circumstances  such as for positions that are illiquid or have transfer restrictions  the fair value reflects liquidity valuation adjustments based on market evidence or predetermined policies 
for certain highly illiquid positions  management s estimates are used to determine these liquidity valuation adjustments 
see recent accounting developments below for a discussion of the impact of sfas no 
 fair value measurements on the valuation of financial instruments 

table of contents derivative contracts 
derivative contracts consist of exchange traded and over the counter otc derivatives 
the following table sets forth the fair value of our exchange traded and otc derivative assets and liabilities derivative assets and liabilities in millions as of november assets liabilities assets liabilities exchange traded derivatives otc derivatives total net of cash received pursuant to credit support agreements of billion and billion as of november and november  respectively 
net of cash paid pursuant to credit support agreements of billion and billion as of november and november  respectively 
fair values of our exchange traded derivatives are generally determined from quoted market prices 
otc derivatives are valued using valuation models 
we use a variety of valuation models including the present value of known or estimated cash flows and option pricing models 
the valuation models that we use to derive the fair values of our otc derivatives require inputs including contractual terms  market prices  yield curves  credit curves  measures of volatility  prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs 
the selection of a model to value an otc derivative depends upon the contractual terms of  and specific risks inherent in  the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market 
we generally use similar models to value similar instruments 
where possible  we verify the values produced by our pricing models to market transactions 
for otc derivatives that trade in liquid markets  such as generic forwards  swaps and options  model selection does not involve significant judgment because market prices are readily available 
for otc derivatives that trade in less liquid markets  model selection requires more judgment because such instruments tend to be more complex and pricing information is less available in these markets 
price transparency is inherently more limited for more complex structures because they often combine one or more product types  requiring additional inputs such as correlations and volatilities 
as markets continue to develop and more pricing information becomes available  we continue to review and refine the models that we use 
at the inception of an otc derivative contract day one  we value the contract at the model value if we can verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model to market transactions 
when appropriate  valuations are adjusted to reflect various factors such as liquidity  bid offer spreads and credit considerations 
these adjustments are generally based on market evidence or predetermined policies 
in certain circumstances  such as for highly illiquid positions  management s estimates are used to determine these adjustments 
where we cannot verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model to market transactions  we value the contract at the transaction price at inception and  consequently  record no day one gain or loss in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
following day one  we adjust the inputs to our valuation models only to the extent that changes in these inputs can be verified by similar market transactions  third party pricing services and or broker quotes  or can be derived from other substantive evidence such as empirical market data 
in circumstances where we cannot verify the model to market transactions  it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value 
see recent accounting developments below for a discussion of the impact of sfas no 
on the valuation of financial instruments 

table of contents the following tables set forth the fair values of our otc derivative assets and liabilities by product and by remaining contractual maturity otc derivatives in millions as of november assets years contract type months months years years or greater total interest rates currencies commodities equities total liabilities years contract type months months years years or greater total interest rates currencies commodities equities total as of november assets years contract type months months years years or greater total interest rates currencies commodities equities total liabilities years contract type months months years years or greater total interest rates currencies commodities equities total includes credit related derivatives 
we enter into certain otc option transactions that provide us or our counterparties with the right to extend the maturity of the underlying contract 
the fair value of these option contracts is not material to the aggregate fair value of our otc derivative portfolio 
in the tables above  for option contracts that require settlement by delivery of an underlying derivative instrument  the remaining contractual maturity is generally classified based upon the maturity date of the underlying derivative instrument 
in those instances where the underlying instrument does not have a maturity date or either counterparty has the right to settle in cash  the remaining contractual maturity is generally based upon the option expiration date 

table of contents principal investments 
the following table sets forth the carrying value of the investments included within the principal investments component of our trading and principal investments segment 
these investments consist of private investments  investments in the convertible preferred stock of smfg and the ordinary shares of icbc  and other public investments principal investments in millions as of november corporate real estate total corporate real estate total private public subtotal smfg convertible preferred stock icbc ordinary shares total excludes assets related to consolidated merchant banking funds of billion and billion as of november and november  respectively  for which goldman sachs is not at risk 
the fair value of our japanese yen denominated investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg includes the effect of foreign exchange revaluation 
we mitigate our economic exposure to exchange rate movements on our investment in smfg by borrowing japanese yen 
foreign exchange revaluation on the investment and the related borrowing are generally equal and offsetting 
for example  if the japanese yen appreciates against the us dollar  the us dollar carrying value of our smfg investment will increase and the us dollar carrying value of the related borrowing will also increase by an amount that is generally equal and offsetting 
excludes an economic hedge on the unrestricted shares of common stock underlying our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg 
the fair value of this hedge was billion and billion as of november and november  respectively  and is reflected in financial instruments sold  but not yet purchased  at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
for a further discussion of the restrictions on our ability to hedge or sell the common stock underlying our investment in smfg  see below 
includes interests of billion as of november held by investment funds managed by goldman sachs 
the fair value of our investment in the ordinary shares of icbc  which trade on the stock exchange of hong kong  includes the effect of foreign exchange revaluation 
our private principal investments  by their nature  have little or no price transparency 
such investments are initially carried at cost as an approximation of fair value 
adjustments to carrying value are made if there are third party transactions evidencing a change in value 
downward adjustments are also made  in the absence of third party transactions  if we determine that the expected realizable value of the investment is less than the carrying value 
in reaching that determination  we consider many factors including  but not limited to  the operating cash flows and financial performance of the companies or properties relative to budgets or projections  trends within sectors and or regions  underlying business models  expected exit timing and strategy  and any specific rights or terms associated with the investment  such as conversion features and liquidation preferences 
see recent accounting developments below for a discussion of the impact of sfas no 
on the valuation of financial instruments 
our public principal investments  which tend to be large  concentrated holdings that result from initial public offerings or other corporate transactions  are valued using quoted market prices less a liquidity valuation adjustment based on predetermined written policies 

table of contents our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg is carried at fair value  which is derived from a model that incorporates smfg s common stock price and credit spreads  the impact of nontransferability and illiquidity  and downside protection on the conversion strike price 
the fair value of our investment is particularly sensitive to movements in the smfg common stock price 
as a result of downside protection on the conversion strike price  the relationship between changes in the fair value of our investment and changes in smfg s common stock price would be nonlinear for a significant decline in the smfg common stock price 
during the year  the fair value of our investment excluding the economic hedge on the unrestricted shares of common stock increased expressed in japanese yen  reflecting the impact of passage of time in respect of the transfer restrictions on the underlying common stock 
our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg is generally nontransferable without the consent of smfg  but is freely convertible into smfg common stock 
as of november  we had hedged two thirds of the common stock underlying our investment in smfg 
restrictions on our ability to hedge or sell the remaining shares will lapse on february  as of november  the conversion price was  subject to downward adjustment if the price of smfg common stock at the time of conversion is less than the conversion price subject to a floor of 
our investment in the ordinary shares of icbc is carried at fair value using quoted market prices less a liquidity valuation adjustment

controls over valuation of financial instruments 
a control infrastructure  independent of the trading and investing functions  is fundamental to ensuring that our financial instruments are appropriately valued and that fair value measurements are reliable 
this is particularly important in valuing instruments with lower levels of price transparency 
we employ an oversight structure that includes appropriate segregation of duties 
senior management  independent of the trading functions  is responsible for the oversight of control and valuation policies and for reporting the results of these policies to our audit committee 
we seek to maintain the necessary resources to ensure that control functions are performed to the highest standards 
we employ procedures for the approval of new transaction types and markets  price verification  review of daily profit and loss  and review of valuation models by personnel with appropriate technical knowledge of relevant products and markets 
these procedures are performed by personnel independent of the revenue producing units 
for trading and principal investments with little or no price transparency  we employ  where possible  procedures that include comparisons with similar observable positions  analysis of actual to projected cash flows  comparisons with subsequent sales and discussions with senior business leaders

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets as a result of our acquisitions  principally slk llc slk in  the ayco company  lp ayco in  cogentrix energy  inc cogentrix in  national energy gas transmission  inc negt in and the acquisition of the variable annuity and variable life insurance business of the hanover insurance group  inc formerly allmerica financial corporation in  we have acquired goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets  including identifiable intangible assets  at the acquisition date 

table of contents goodwill 
we test the goodwill in each of our operating segments for impairment at least annually in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  by comparing the estimated fair value of each operating segment with its estimated net book value 
we derive the fair value of each of our operating segments primarily based on price earnings multiples 
we derive the net book value of our operating segments by estimating the amount of shareholders equity required to support the activities of each operating segment 
our last annual impairment test was performed during our fourth quarter and no impairment was identified 
the following table sets forth the carrying value of our goodwill by operating segment goodwill by operating segment in millions as of november investment banking financial advisory underwriting trading and principal investments ficc equities principal investments asset management and securities services asset management securities services total primarily related to slk 
primarily related to ayco 
identifiable intangible assets 
we amortize our identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives in accordance with sfas no 
 and test for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset s or asset group s carrying value may not be fully recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
an impairment loss  calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group  is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value 

table of contents the following table sets forth the carrying value and range of remaining useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets by major asset class identifiable intangible assets by asset class in millions as of november range of remaining carrying useful lives carrying value in years value customer lists power contracts new york stock exchange nyse specialist rights insurance related assets exchange traded fund etf specialist rights other total primarily includes our clearance and execution and nasdaq customer lists related to slk and financial counseling customer lists related to ayco 
primarily relates to above market power contracts of consolidated power generation facilities related to cogentrix and negt 
substantially all of these power contracts have been pledged to counterparties in connection with our secured financings 
the increase in the carrying value of power contracts in was due to a restructuring of certain contracts  which resulted in the consolidation of the associated power generation facilities that had been previously accounted for under the equity method 
consists of the value of business acquired voba and deferred acquisition costs dac 
voba represents the present value of estimated future gross profits of the variable annuity and variable life insurance business acquired in dac results from commissions paid by goldman sachs to the primary insurer ceding company on life and annuity reinsurance agreements as compensation to place the business with us and to cover the ceding company s acquisition expenses 
voba and dac are amortized over the estimated life of the underlying contracts based on estimated gross profits  and amortization is adjusted based on actual experience 
the seven year useful life represents the weighted average remaining amortization period of the underlying contracts certain of which extend for approximately years 
primarily includes technology related and other assets related to slk 
during the first quarter of  we reduced the estimated useful lives of our nyse specialist rights from years to years 
this change was due to higher than expected attrition in acquired nyse specialist rights  primarily from mergers and delistings 
a prolonged period of weakness in global equity markets and the trading of securities in multiple markets and on multiple exchanges could adversely impact our businesses and impair the value of our goodwill and or identifiable intangible assets 
in addition  certain events could indicate a potential impairment of our identifiable intangible assets  including i changes in market structure that could adversely affect our specialist businesses  ii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  iii a default event under a power contract or physical damage or other adverse events impacting the underlying power generation facilities  or iv adverse actual experience on the contracts in our variable annuity and variable life insurance business 

table of contents use of estimates the use of generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates 
in addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  the use of estimates is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits 
we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
our total liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering  among other factors  the progress of each case or proceeding  our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings  and the opinions and views of legal counsel 
given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of our litigation and regulatory matters  particularly in cases or proceedings in which substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought  we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred

off balance sheet arrangements we have various types of off balance sheet arrangements that we enter into in the ordinary course of business 
our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms  including purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in mortgage backed and other asset backed securitization vehicles  holding senior and subordinated debt  interests in limited and general partnerships  and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles  entering into interest rate  foreign currency  equity  commodity and credit derivatives  including total return swaps  entering into operating leases  and providing guarantees  indemnifications  loan commitments  letters of credit  representations and warranties 
we enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes  primarily related to the securitization of commercial and residential mortgages  home equity and auto loans  government and corporate bonds  and other types of financial assets 
other reasons for entering into these arrangements include underwriting client securitization transactions  providing secondary market liquidity  making investments in performing and nonperforming debt  equity  real estate and other assets  providing investors with credit linked and asset repackaged notes  and receiving or providing letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and settlement process 
we engage in transactions with variable interest entities vies and qualifying special purpose entities qspes 
such vehicles are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets  including the mortgage backed and other asset backed securities markets  since they provide market liquidity to financial assets by offering investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process 
our financial interests in  and derivative transactions with  such nonconsolidated entities are accounted for at fair value  in the same manner as our other financial instruments  except in cases where we apply the equity method of accounting

equity capital the level and composition of our equity capital are principally determined by our consolidated regulatory capital requirements  subsidiary capital requirements and rating agency guidelines 
the equity capital we hold may also be influenced by the business environment  conditions in the financial markets and an assessment of potential future losses during an extremely adverse business and market environment 
as of november  our total shareholders equity was billion consisting of common shareholders equity of billion and preferred stock of billion compared with total shareholders equity of billion as of november consisting of common shareholders equity of billion and preferred stock of billion 
in addition to total shareholders equity  we consider the billion of junior subordinated debt issued to a trust see below part of our equity capital  as it qualifies as capital for regulatory and certain rating agency purposes 
consolidated regulatory capital requirements during  goldman sachs became regulated by the us securities and exchange commission sec as a consolidated supervised entity cse 
as such  goldman sachs is subject to group wide supervision and examination by the sec and to minimum capital adequacy standards on a consolidated basis 
minimum capital adequacy standards are principally driven by the amount of our market risk  credit risk and operational risk as calculated by methodologies approved by the sec 
eligible sources of regulatory capital include common equity and certain types of preferred stock  debt and hybrid instruments  including our junior subordinated debt issued to a trust 
the recognition of preferred stock  debt and hybrid instruments as regulatory capital is subject to limitations 
goldman sachs was in compliance with the cse capital adequacy standards as of november and november 
table of contents subsidiary capital requirements many of our principal subsidiaries are subject to separate regulation and capital requirements in the united states and or elsewhere 
goldman  sachs co 
and goldman sachs execution clearing  lp are registered lp broker dealers and futures commissions merchants  and their primary regulators include the sec  the commodity futures trading commission  the chicago board of trade  the nyse  the national association of securities dealers  inc and the national futures association

goldman sachs japan co  ltd 
gsjcl  our regulated japanese broker dealer  is subject to regulation by japan s financial services agency 
prior to october   goldman sachs japan ltd 
gsjl  the predecessor to gsjcl  was our primary regulated subsidiary based in japan 
several other subsidiaries of goldman sachs are regulated by securities  investment advisory  banking  and other regulators and authorities around the world  such as the federal financial supervisory authority bafin and the bundesbank in germany  banque de france and the autorit des march s financiers in france  banca d italia and the commissione nazionale per le societ e la borsa consob in italy  the swiss federal banking commission  the securities and futures commission in hong kong  the monetary authority of singapore and the china securities regulatory commission 
goldman sachs bank usa gs bank  a wholly owned industrial bank  is regulated by the federal deposit insurance corporation and the state of utah department of financial institutions and is subject to minimum capital requirements 
as of november and november  these subsidiaries were in compliance with their local capital requirements 
as discussed above  many of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements in jurisdictions throughout the world 
subsidiaries not subject to separate regulation may hold capital to satisfy local tax guidelines  rating agency requirements or internal policies  including policies concerning the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based upon its underlying risk 
for a discussion of our potential inability to access funds from our subsidiaries  see liquidity and funding risk conservative liability structure below 
equity investments in subsidiaries are generally funded with parent company equity capital 
as of november  group inc s equity investment in subsidiaries was billion compared with its total shareholders equity of billion 
our capital invested in non us subsidiaries is generally exposed to foreign exchange risk  substantially all of which is managed primarily through the use of derivative contracts 
in addition  we generally manage the non trading exposure to foreign exchange risk that arises from transactions denominated in currencies other than the transacting entity s functional currency 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k for further information regarding our regulated subsidiaries 

table of contents rating agency guidelines the credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of the goldman sachs group  inc  which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of goldman sachs senior unsecured obligations 
the level and composition of our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings 
each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy  and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation 
see liquidity and funding risk credit ratings below for further information regarding our credit ratings 
equity capital management our objective is to maintain a sufficient level and optimize the composition of our equity capital 
we manage our capital through repurchases of our common stock and issuances of preferred stock  junior subordinated debt issued to a trust and subordinated debt 
share repurchase program 
we use our share repurchase program to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity and to substantially offset increases in share count over time resulting from employee share based compensation 
the repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open market purchases and is influenced by our overall capital position the comparison of our capital requirements to our available capital  general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock 
the following table sets forth the level of share repurchases for the years ended november and november as of november in millions  except per share amounts number of shares repurchased total cost average cost per share as of november  we were authorized to repurchase up to million additional shares of common stock pursuant to our repurchase program

all preferred stock also has a preference over our common stock upon liquidation 
junior subordinated debt issued to a trust 
as of november  we had outstanding junior subordinated debt issued to a trust of billion  included in unsecured long term borrowings on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
the inherent characteristics of these securities  including the long term nature of the securities  our ability to defer coupon interest for up to ten consecutive semiannual periods and the subordinated nature of the obligations in our capital structure  are such that they qualify as regulatory capital for cse purposes  and thus  are part of our equity capital 
subordinated debt

see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k for further information regarding our leases 
our occupancy expenses include costs associated with office space held in excess of our current requirements 
this excess space  the cost of which is charged to earnings as incurred  is being held for potential growth or to replace currently occupied space that we may exit in the future 
we regularly evaluate our current and future space capacity in relation to current and projected staffing levels 
we may incur exit costs in and thereafter to the extent we i reduce our space capacity or ii commit to  or occupy  new properties in the locations in which we operate and  consequently  dispose of existing space that had been held for potential growth 
these exit costs may be material to our results of operations in a given period 
as of november and november  we had construction related obligations of billion and million  respectively  including purchase obligations of billion and 
table of contents million  respectively  related to the development of wind energy projects 
construction related obligations also include outstanding purchase obligations of million and million as of november and november  respectively  related to our new world headquarters in new york city  which is expected to cost between billion and billion

in connection with our lending activities  we had outstanding commitments to extend credit of billion as of november compared with billion as of november since these commitments may expire unused or be reduced or cancelled at the counterparty s request  the total commitment amount does not necessarily reflect the actual future cash flow requirements 
our commercial lending commitments outside the william street credit extension program are generally extended in connection with contingent acquisition financing and other types of corporate lending 
we may seek to reduce our credit risk on these commitments by syndicating all or substantial portions of commitments to other investors 
in addition  commitments that are extended for contingent acquisition financing are often short term in nature  as borrowers often replace them with other funding sources 
substantially all of the commitments provided under the william street credit extension program are to investment grade corporate borrowers 
commitments under the program are primarily extended by william street commitment corporation commitment corp  a consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of group inc whose assets and liabilities are legally separated from other assets 
table of contents and liabilities of goldman sachs  and  to a lesser extent  by william street credit corporation  another consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of group inc a majority of the commitments extended by commitment corp

with respect to substantially all of the william street commitments  smfg provides us with credit loss protection that is generally limited to of the first loss we realize on approved loan commitments  up to a maximum of billion 
in addition  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  upon our request  smfg will provide protection for of the second loss on such commitments  up to a maximum of billion 
we also use other financial instruments to mitigate credit risks related to certain william street commitments not covered by smfg 
our commitments to extend credit also include financing for the warehousing of financial assets to be securitized  primarily in connection with collateralized debt obligations cdos and mortgage securitizations  which are expected to be repaid from the proceeds of the related securitizations for which we may or may not act as underwriter 
these arrangements are secured by the warehoused assets  primarily consisting of mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  residential and commercial mortgages and corporate debt instruments

risk management management believes that effective risk management is of primary importance to the success of goldman sachs 
accordingly  we have a comprehensive risk management process to monitor  evaluate and manage the principal risks we assume in conducting our activities 
these risks include market  credit  liquidity  operational  legal and reputational exposures 
risk management structure we seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a variety of separate but complementary financial  credit  operational  compliance and legal reporting systems 
in addition  a number of committees are responsible for monitoring risk exposures and for general oversight of our risk management process  as described further below 
these committees including their subcommittees  meet regularly and consist of senior members of both our revenue producing units and departments that are independent of our revenue producing units 
segregation of duties and management oversight are fundamental elements of our risk management process 
in addition to the committees described below  functions that are independent of the revenue producing units  such as compliance  finance  legal  management controls internal audit and operations  perform risk management functions  which include monitoring  analyzing and evaluating risk 
management committee 
all risk control functions ultimately report to our management committee 
through both direct and delegated authority  the management committee approves all of our operating activities  trading risk parameters and customer review guidelines 
risk committees 
the firmwide risk committee reviews the activities of existing businesses  approves new businesses and products  approves firmwide and divisional market risk limits  reviews business unit market risk limits  approves market risk limits for selected sovereign markets and business units  approves sovereign credit risk limits and credit risk limits by ratings group  and reviews scenario analyses based on abnormal or catastrophic market movements 

table of contents the divisional risk committee sets market risk limits for our trading activities subject to overall firmwide risk limits  based on a number of measures  including value at risk var  stress tests and scenario analyses 
several other committees oversee various risk  valuation  operational  credit and business practice issues related to our asset management business 
business unit risk limits are established by the various risk committees and may be further allocated by the business unit managers to individual trading desks 
trading desk managers have the first line of responsibility for managing risk within prescribed limits 
these managers have in depth knowledge of the primary sources of risk in their respective markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures 
market risk limits are monitored by the finance division and are reviewed regularly by the appropriate risk committee 
limit violations are reported to the appropriate risk committee and business unit managers and addressed  as necessary 
credit risk limits are also monitored by the finance division and reviewed by the appropriate risk committee 
business practices committee 
the business practices committee assists senior management in its oversight of compliance  legal and operational risks and related reputational concerns  such as potential conflicts of interest 
the business practices committee also reviews goldman sachs business practices  policies  and procedures for consistency with our business principles 
the business practices committee reviews these areas and makes recommendations for improvements as necessary to mitigate potential risks and assist in achieving adherence to our business principles 
firmwide capital committee 
the firmwide capital committee reviews and approves transactions involving commitments of our capital 
such capital commitments include  but are not limited to  extensions of credit  alternative liquidity commitments  certain bond underwritings and certain distressed debt and principal finance activities 
the firmwide capital committee is also responsible for establishing business and reputational standards for capital commitments and ensuring that they are maintained on a global basis 
commitments committee 
the commitments committee reviews and approves underwriting and distribution activities  primarily with respect to offerings of equity and equity related securities  and sets and maintains policies and procedures designed to ensure that legal  reputational  regulatory and business standards are maintained in conjunction with these activities

credit policy committee 
the credit policy committee establishes and reviews broad credit policies and parameters that are implemented by the credit department 
finance committee 
the finance committee establishes and oversees our liquidity policies  sets certain inventory position limits and has oversight responsibility for liquidity risk  the size and composition of our balance sheet and capital base  and our credit ratings 
the finance committee regularly reviews our funding position and capitalization and makes adjustments in light of current events  risks and exposures 
new products committee 
the new products committee  under the oversight of the firmwide risk committee  is responsible for reviewing and approving new products and businesses globally 
operational risk committee 
the operational risk committee provides oversight of the ongoing development and implementation of our operational risk policies  framework and methodologies  and monitors the effectiveness of operational risk management 
structured products committee 
the structured products committee reviews and approves structured product transactions entered into with our clients that raise legal  regulatory  tax or accounting issues or present reputational risk to goldman sachs 

table of contents market risk the potential for changes in the market value of our trading and investing positions is referred to as market risk 
such positions result from market making  specialist  proprietary trading and investing  and underwriting activities 
categories of market risk include exposures to interest rates  equity prices  currency rates and commodity prices 
a description of each market risk category is set forth below interest rate risks primarily result from exposures to changes in the level  slope and curvature of the yield curve  the volatility of interest rates  mortgage prepayment speeds and credit spreads 
equity price risks result from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities  equity baskets and equity indices 
currency rate risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and volatilities of currency rates 
commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and volatilities of commodities  such as electricity  natural gas  crude oil  petroleum products  and precious and base metals 
we seek to manage these risks by diversifying exposures  controlling position sizes and establishing economic hedges in related securities or derivatives 
for example  we may hedge a portfolio of common stocks by taking an offsetting position in a related equity index futures contract 
the ability to manage an exposure may  however  be limited by adverse changes in the liquidity of the security or the related hedge instrument and in the correlation of price movements between the security and related hedge instrument 
in addition to applying business judgment  senior management uses a number of quantitative tools to manage our exposure to market risk for our long and short financial instruments 
these tools include risk limits based on a summary measure of market risk exposure referred to as var  scenario analyses  stress tests and other analytical tools that measure the potential effects on our trading net revenues of various market events  including  but not limited to  a large widening of credit spreads  a substantial decline in equity markets and significant moves in selected emerging markets  and inventory position limits for selected business units 
var var is the potential loss in value of goldman sachs trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level 
for the var numbers reported below  a one day time horizon and a confidence level were used 
this means that there is a in chance that daily trading net revenues will fall below the expected daily trading net revenues by an amount at least as large as the reported var 
thus  shortfalls from expected trading net revenues on a single trading day greater than the reported var would be anticipated to occur  on average  about once a month 
shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported var by significant amounts 
shortfalls can also accumulate over a longer time horizon such as a number of consecutive trading days 
the modeling of the risk characteristics of our trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
while management believes that these assumptions and approximations are reasonable  there is no standard methodology for estimating var  and different assumptions and or approximations could produce materially different var estimates 

table of contents we use historical data to estimate our var and  to better reflect current asset volatilities  we generally weight historical data to give greater importance to more recent observations 
given its reliance on historical data  var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
an inherent limitation of var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 
different var methodologies and distributional assumptions could produce a materially different var 
moreover  var calculated for a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within one day 
changes in var between reporting periods are generally due to changes in levels of exposure  volatilities and or correlations among asset classes 
the following tables set forth the daily var average daily var in millions year ended november risk categories interest rates equity prices currency rates commodity prices diversification effect total beginning in the first quarter of  we excluded from our calculation of var certain equity positions generally due to their transfer restrictions or illiquidity 
the effect of excluding these positions was not material to prior periods and  accordingly  such periods have not been adjusted 
for a further discussion of the market risk associated with these positions  see other market risk measures below 
equals the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for the four risk categories 
this effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated 
our average daily var increased to million in from million in we increased our level of exposure across all risk categories  particularly equity prices and interest rates 
our average daily var increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to higher levels of exposure to commodity prices  equity prices and interest rates  partially offset by reduced exposures to currency rates  as well as reduced volatilities  particularly in interest rate and equity assets

the following chart presents our daily var during daily var graph

the following chart sets forth the frequency distribution of our daily trading net revenues for substantially all inventory positions included in var for the year ended november daily trading net revenue graph beginning in the fourth quarter of  we excluded daily net revenues from our insurance business and our power generation facilities from this chart 
amounts for the full year have been adjusted accordingly 
as part of our overall risk control process  daily trading net revenues are compared with var calculated as of the end of the prior business day 
trading losses incurred on a single day exceeded our one day var on three occasions during other market risk measures certain portfolios and individual positions are not included in var  where var is not the most appropriate measure of risk eg  due to transfer restrictions and or illiquidity 
the market risk related to our investments in the convertible preferred stock of smfg and the ordinary shares of icbc is measured by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues associated with a decline in the smfg common stock price and a decline in the icbc ordinary share price  respectively 
the market risk related to the remaining positions is measured by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues associated with a decline in asset values 
the sensitivity analyses for equity and debt positions in our trading portfolio and equity  debt primarily mezzanine instruments and real estate positions in our non trading portfolio are measured by the impact of a decline in the asset values including the impact of leverage in the underlying investments for real estate positions in our non trading portfolio of such positions 
the fair values of the underlying positions may be sensitive to changes in a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the financial performance of the companies or properties relative to budgets or projections  the projected timing and amount of future cash flows  discount rates  trends within sectors and or regions  underlying business models and equity prices 

table of contents the sensitivity analysis of our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg  net of the economic hedge on the unrestricted shares of common stock underlying a portion of our investment  is measured by the impact of a decline in the smfg common stock price 
this sensitivity should not be extrapolated to a significant decline in the smfg common stock price  as the relationship between the fair value of our investment and the smfg common stock price would be nonlinear due to downside protection on the conversion stock price 
the sensitivity analysis of our investment in the ordinary shares of icbc excludes interests held by investment funds managed by goldman sachs 
the following table sets forth market risk for positions not included in var

the effect of excluding these positions from var was not material to prior periods and  accordingly  var for such periods has not been adjusted 
we have calculated the sensitivity measure for these equity positions ie  trading risk equity as of november to provide a period to period comparison 
to the extent that other market risk measures in the above table were affected  such measures have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation 
in addition to the positions in these portfolios  which are accounted for at fair value  we make investments accounted for under the equity method and we also make direct investments in real estate  both of which are included in other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
direct investments in real estate are accounted for at cost less accumulated depreciation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k for information on other assets 
relates to interests in our real estate investment funds 
during  the market risk for equity positions in our trading portfolio increased due to new investments as well as an increase in the fair value of the portfolio 
the increase in market risk in for debt positions in our trading portfolio and debt  real estate and other equity positions in our non trading portfolio was primarily due to new investments 
the decrease in market risk in for smfg was primarily due to the impact of additional hedging with respect to the second one third installment of unrestricted shares underlying our investment  partially offset by the increase in the fair value of our investment due to the passage of time in respect of the transfer restrictions on the underlying common stock 
credit risk credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a counterparty or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold fails to perform under its contractual obligations to us  or upon a deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or other instruments  including otc 
table of contents derivatives  we hold 
our exposure to credit risk principally arises through our trading  investing and financing activities 
to reduce our credit exposures  we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
in addition  we attempt to further reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by i entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from a counterparty on an upfront or contingent basis  ii seeking third party guarantees of the counterparty s obligations  and or iii transferring our credit risk to third parties using credit derivatives and or other structures and techniques 
to measure and manage our credit exposures  we use a variety of tools  including credit limits referenced to both current exposure and potential exposure 
potential exposure is generally based on projected worst case market movements over the life of a transaction 
in addition  as part of our market risk management process  for positions measured by changes in credit spreads  we use var and other sensitivity measures 
to supplement our primary credit exposure measures  we also use scenario analyses  such as credit spread widening scenarios  stress tests and other quantitative tools 
our global credit management systems monitor credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their affiliates 
these systems also provide management  including the firmwide risk and credit policy committees  with information regarding credit risk by product  industry sector  country and region 
while our activities expose us to many different industries and counterparties  we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment funds and other institutional clients  resulting in significant credit concentration with respect to this industry 
in the ordinary course of business  we may also be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty  borrower or issuer 
as of both november and november  we held us government and federal agency obligations that represented and of our total assets  respectively 
in addition  most of our financial instruments purchased under agreements to resell as well as some derivatives are collateralized by us government  federal agency and other sovereign obligations 
as of november and november  we did not have credit exposure to any other counterparty that exceeded of our total assets 
however  over the past several years  the amount and duration of our credit exposures have been increasing  due to  among other factors  the growth of our lending and otc derivative activities and market evolution towards longer dated transactions 
a further discussion of our derivative activities follows below 
credit risk on derivatives derivative contracts are instruments  such as futures  forwards  swaps or option contracts  that derive their value from underlying assets  indices  reference rates or a combination of these factors 
derivative instruments may be privately negotiated contracts  which are often referred to as otc derivatives  or they may be listed and traded on an exchange 
substantially all of our derivative transactions are entered into to facilitate client transactions  to take proprietary positions or as a means of risk management 
in addition to derivative transactions entered into for trading purposes  we enter into derivative contracts to manage currency exposure on our net investment in non us operations and to manage the interest rate and currency exposure on our long term borrowings and certain short term borrowings 
derivatives are used in many of our businesses  and we believe that the associated market risk can only be understood relative to all of the underlying assets or risks being hedged  or as part of a broader trading strategy 
accordingly  the market risk of derivative positions is managed together with our nonderivative positions 
fair values of our derivative contracts are reflected net of cash paid or received pursuant to credit support agreements and are reported on a net by counterparty basis in our consolidated 
table of contents statements of financial condition when management believes a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement 
for an otc derivative  our credit exposure is directly with our counterparty and continues until the maturity or termination of such contract 
the following table sets forth the distribution  by credit rating  of substantially all of our exposure with respect to otc derivatives as of november and november  after taking into consideration the effect of netting agreements 
the categories shown reflect our internally determined public rating agency equivalents over the counter derivative credit exposure in millions as of as of november november exposure percentage of percentage of collateral net of total exposure total exposure credit rating equivalent exposure held collateral net of collateral net of collateral aaa aaa aa aa a a bbb baa bb ba or lower unrated total net of cash received pursuant to credit support agreements of billion 
the following tables set forth our otc derivative credit exposure  net of collateral  by remaining contractual maturity exposure net of collateral in millions years credit rating equivalent months months years years or greater total aaa aaa aa aa a a bbb baa bb ba or lower unrated total years contract type months months years years or greater total interest rates currencies commodities equities total where we have obtained collateral from a counterparty under a master trading agreement that covers multiple products and transactions  we have allocated the collateral ratably based on exposure before giving effect to such collateral 
includes credit related derivatives 

table of contents derivative transactions may also involve legal risks including the risk that they are not authorized or appropriate for a counterparty  that documentation has not been properly executed or that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the counterparty 
we attempt to minimize these risks by obtaining advice of counsel on the enforceability of agreements as well as on the authority of a counterparty to effect the derivative transaction 
in addition  certain derivative transactions eg  credit derivative contracts involve the risk that we may have difficulty obtaining  or be unable to obtain  the underlying security or obligation in order to satisfy any physical settlement requirement 
liquidity and funding risk liquidity is of critical importance to companies in the financial services sector 
most failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity resulting from adverse circumstances 
accordingly  goldman sachs has in place a comprehensive set of liquidity and funding policies that are intended to maintain significant flexibility to address both goldman sachs specific and broader industry or market liquidity events 
our principal objective is to be able to fund goldman sachs and to enable our core businesses to continue to generate revenue even under adverse circumstances 
management has implemented a number of policies according to the following liquidity risk management framework excess liquidity we maintain substantial excess liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows in a stressed environment including financing obligations 
asset liability management we ensure our funding sources are sufficiently long term in order to withstand a prolonged or severe liquidity stressed environment without having to rely on asset sales 
conservative liability structure we access funding across a diverse range of markets  products and counterparties  emphasize less credit sensitive sources of funding and conservatively manage the distribution of funding across our entity structure 
crisis planning we base our liquidity and funding management on stress scenario planning and maintain a crisis plan detailing our response to a liquidity threatening event 
excess liquidity our most important liquidity policy is to pre fund what we estimate will be our likely cash needs during a liquidity crisis and hold such excess liquidity in the form of unencumbered  highly liquid securities that may be sold or pledged to provide same day liquidity 
this global core excess liquidity is intended to allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit sensitive markets 
we believe that this pool of excess liquidity provides us with a resilient source of funds and gives us significant flexibility in managing through a difficult funding environment 
our global core excess reflects the following principles the first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company s survival 
focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows  not just disruptions to financing flows 
goldman sachs businesses are diverse  and its cash needs are driven by many factors  including market movements  collateral requirements and client commitments  all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment 
during a liquidity crisis  credit sensitive funding  including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements  may be unavailable and the terms or availability of other types of secured financing may change 

table of contents as a result of our policy to pre fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis  we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger unsecured debt balances than our businesses would otherwise require 
we believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities  even though it increases our unsecured liabilities 
the size of our global core excess is based on an internal liquidity model together with a qualitative assessment of the condition of the financial markets and of goldman sachs 
our liquidity model identifies and estimates cash and collateral outflows over a short term horizon in a liquidity crisis  including  but not limited to upcoming maturities of unsecured debt and letters of credit  potential buybacks of a portion of our outstanding negotiable unsecured debt  adverse changes in the terms or availability of secured funding  derivatives and other margin and collateral outflows  including those due to market moves  potential cash outflows associated with our prime brokerage business  additional collateral that could be called in the event of a two notch downgrade in our credit ratings  draws on our unfunded commitments not supported by william street funding corporation  and upcoming cash outflows  such as tax and other large payments 
the following table sets forth the average loan value the estimated amount of cash that would be advanced by counterparties against these securities of our global core excess year ended november in millions us dollar denominated non us dollar denominated total global core excess the us dollar denominated excess is comprised of only unencumbered us government and agency securities and highly liquid mortgage securities  all of which are federal reserve repo eligible  as well as overnight cash deposits 
our non us dollar denominated excess is comprised of only unencumbered french  german  united kingdom and japanese government bonds and euro  british pound and japanese yen overnight cash deposits 
we strictly limit our global core excess to this narrowly defined list of securities and cash that we believe are highly liquid  even in a difficult funding environment 
the majority of our global core excess is structured such that it is available to meet the liquidity requirements of our parent company  group inc  and all of its subsidiaries 
the remainder is primarily held to better match the currency and timing requirements for potential liquidity obligations of our principal non us operating entities 
the global core excess excludes liquid assets of billion held separately by william street funding corporation 
see contractual obligations and commitments above for a further discussion of the william street credit extension program 

table of contents in addition to our global core excess  we have a significant amount of other unencumbered securities as a result of our business activities 
these assets  which are located in the united states  europe and asia  include other government bonds  high grade money market securities  corporate bonds and marginable equities 
we do not include these securities in our global core excess 
we maintain global core excess and other unencumbered assets in an amount that  if pledged or sold  would provide the funds necessary to replace at least of our unsecured obligations that are scheduled to mature or where holders have the option to redeem within the next months 
we assume conservative loan values that are based on stress scenario borrowing capacity and we regularly review these assumptions asset class by asset class 
asset liability management we seek to maintain a highly liquid balance sheet and substantially all of our inventory is marked to market daily 
we utilize aged inventory limits for certain financial instruments as a disincentive to our businesses to hold inventory over longer periods of time 
we believe that these limits provide a complementary mechanism for ensuring appropriate balance sheet liquidity in addition to our standard position limits 
although our balance sheet fluctuates due to seasonal activity  market conventions and periodic market opportunities in certain of our businesses  our total assets and adjusted assets at financial statement dates are not materially different than those occurring within our reporting periods 
we seek to manage the maturity profile of our funding base such that we should be able to liquidate our assets prior to our liabilities coming due  even in times of prolonged or severe liquidity stress 
we do not rely on immediate sales of assets other than our global core excess to maintain liquidity in a distressed environment  although we recognize orderly asset sales may be prudent and necessary in a persistent liquidity crisis 
in order to avoid reliance on asset sales  our goal is to ensure that we have sufficient total capital unsecured long term borrowings plus total shareholders equity to fund our balance sheet for at least one year 
the amount of our total capital is based on an internal liquidity model  which incorporates  among other things  the following long term financing requirements the portion of financial instruments owned that we believe could not be funded on a secured basis in periods of market stress  assuming conservative loan values  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  property  leasehold improvements and equipment  and other illiquid assets  derivative and other margin and collateral requirements  anticipated draws on our unfunded loan commitments  and capital or other forms of financing in our regulated subsidiaries that is in excess of their long term financing requirements 
see conservative liability structure below for a further discussion of how we fund our subsidiaries 

table of contents certain financial instruments may be more difficult to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress 
accordingly  we generally hold higher levels of total capital for these assets than more liquid types of financial instruments 
the table below sets forth our aggregate holdings in these categories of financial instruments as of november in millions mortgage whole loans and collateralized debt obligations bank loans high yield securities emerging market debt securities smfg convertible preferred stock icbc ordinary shares other corporate principal investments other private equity and restricted public equity securities real estate principal investments includes certain mortgage backed interests held in qspes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k for further information regarding our securitization activities 
includes funded commitments and inventory held in connection with our origination and secondary trading activities 
includes interests of billion as of november held by investment funds managed by goldman sachs 
excludes assets related to consolidated merchant banking funds of billion and billion as of november and november  respectively  for which goldman sachs is not at risk 
a large portion of these assets are funded through secured funding markets or nonrecourse financing 
we focus on demonstrating a consistent ability to fund these assets on a secured basis for extended periods of time to reduce refinancing risk and to help ensure that they have an established amount of loan value in order that they can be funded in periods of market stress 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k for further information regarding the financial instruments we hold 
conservative liability structure we seek to structure our liabilities conservatively to reduce refinancing risk and the risk that we may redeem or repurchase certain of our borrowings prior to their contractual maturity 
our conservative liability structure reflects the following policies we fund a substantial portion of our inventory on a secured basis 
we believe secured financing provides goldman sachs with a more stable source of liquidity than unsecured financing  as it is less sensitive to changes in our credit due to underlying collateral 
our liquidity depends to an important degree on the stability of our short term unsecured financing base 
accordingly  we prefer the use of promissory notes in which goldman sachs does not make a market over commercial paper  which we may repurchase prior to maturity through the ordinary course of business as a market maker 
as of november and november  our unsecured short term borrowings  including the current portion of unsecured long term borrowings was billion and billion  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k for further information regarding our unsecured short term borrowings 

table of contents we recognize that secured funding transactions have greater refinancing risk when the underlying collateral is more difficult to fund 
consequently  we seek longer maturities for secured funding transactions collateralized by these assets 
in some cases  we use extendible maturity features to obtain a rolling minimum term to the funding 
we issue substantially all of our unsecured debt without provisions that would  based solely upon an adverse change in our credit ratings  financial ratios  earnings  cash flows or stock price  trigger a requirement for an early payment  collateral support  change in terms  acceleration of maturity or the creation of an additional financial obligation 
we seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources globally for both secured and unsecured funding 
we make extensive use of the repurchase agreement and securities lending markets  as well as other secured funding markets 
in addition  we issue debt through syndicated us registered offerings  us registered and a medium term note programs  offshore medium term note offerings and other bond offerings  us and us commercial paper and promissory note issuances  and other methods 
we also arrange for letters of credit to be issued on our behalf 
we benefit from distributing our debt issuances through our own sales force to a large  diverse global creditor base and we believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity 
our creditors include banks  governments  securities lenders  pension funds  insurance companies and mutual funds 
we access funding in a variety of markets in the united states  europe and asia 
we have imposed various internal guidelines on investor concentration  including the amount of our commercial paper that can be owned and letters of credit that can be issued by any single investor or group of investors 
to mitigate refinancing risk  we have created internal guidelines on the principal amount of debt maturing on any one day or during any week or year 
the following table sets forth our quarterly unsecured long term borrowings maturity profile through maturity profile bar chart our unsecured long term borrowings include extendible debt if the earliest maturity is one year or greater from our financial statement date 
extendible debt is categorized in the maturity profile at the earliest possible maturity even though the debt can be  and in the past generally has been  extended 

table of contents the weighted average maturity of our unsecured long term borrowings as of november was approximately eight years 
we swap a substantial portion of our long term borrowings into us dollar obligations with short term floating interest rates in order to minimize our exposure to interest rates and foreign exchange movements 
for a discussion of factors that could impair our ability to access the capital markets  see certain risk factors that may affect our business above as well as risk factors in part i  item a of the annual report on form k 
subsidiary funding policies 
substantially all of our unsecured funding is raised by our parent company  group inc the parent company then lends the necessary funds to its subsidiaries  some of which are regulated  to meet their asset financing and capital requirements 
in addition  the parent company provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements 
the benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding include enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries 
our intercompany funding policies are predicated on an assumption that  unless legally provided for  funds or securities are not freely available from a subsidiary to its parent company or other subsidiaries 
in particular  many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or limit the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to group inc regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that group inc needs to make payments on obligations  including debt obligations 
as such  we assume that capital or other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to our parent company or other subsidiaries 
in addition  we assume that the global core excess held in our principal non us operating entities will not be available to our parent company or other subsidiaries and therefore is available only to meet the potential liquidity requirements of those entities 
we also manage our liquidity risk by requiring senior and subordinated intercompany loans to have maturities equal to or shorter than the maturities of the aggregate borrowings of the parent company 
this policy ensures that the subsidiaries obligations to the parent company will generally mature in advance of the parent company s third party borrowings 
in addition  many of our subsidiaries and affiliates pledge collateral to the parent company to cover their intercompany borrowings other than subordinated debt in order to mitigate parent company liquidity risk 
group inc has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness  directly or indirectly  to its regulated subsidiaries  for example  as of november  group inc had billion of such equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in goldman  sachs co  its principal us registered broker dealer  billion invested in goldman sachs international  a regulated uk broker dealer  billion invested in goldman sachs execution clearing  lp  a lp registered broker dealer  and billion invested in goldman sachs japan co  ltd 
gsjcl a regulated japanese broker dealer 
group inc also had billion of unsubordinated loans to these entities as of november  as well as significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries 
crisis planning in order to be prepared for a liquidity event  or a period of market stress  we base our liquidity risk management framework and our resulting funding and liquidity policies on conservative stress scenario assumptions 
our planning incorporates several market based and operational stress scenarios 
we also periodically conduct liquidity crisis drills to test our lines of communication and backup funding procedures 
in addition  we maintain a liquidity crisis plan that specifies an approach for analyzing and responding to a liquidity threatening event 
the plan provides the framework to estimate the likely impact of a liquidity event on goldman sachs based on some of the risks identified above and outlines which and to what extent liquidity maintenance activities should be implemented based on 
table of contents the severity of the event 
it also lists the crisis management team and internal and external parties to be contacted to ensure effective distribution of information 
credit ratings we rely upon the short term and long term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day to day operations 
the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings 
credit ratings are important when we are competing in certain markets and when we seek to engage in longer term transactions  including otc derivatives 
we believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies assessment of our liquidity  market  credit and operational risk management practices  the level and variability of our earnings  our capital base  our franchise  reputation and management  our corporate governance and the external operating environment 
see certain risk factors that may affect our business above for a discussion of the risks associated with a reduction in our credit ratings 
the following table sets forth our unsecured credit ratings as of november short term debt long term debt subordinated debt preferred stock dominion bond rating service limited r middle aa low not applicable not applicable fitch  inc f aa a a moody s investors service p aa a a standard poor s a aa a a during  we issued billion of subordinated debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k for further information regarding our subordinated debt 
during the fourth quarter of  standard poor s raised our short term debt rating from a to a  our long term debt rating from a to aa  our subordinated debt from a to a and our preferred stock from a to a 
as of november  collateral or termination payments pursuant to bilateral agreements with certain counterparties of approximately million would have been required in the event of a one notch reduction in our long term credit ratings 
in evaluating our liquidity requirements  we consider additional collateral or termination payments that would be required in the event of a two notch downgrade in our long term credit ratings  as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties  but is available to them 
cash flows as a global financial institution  our cash flows are complex and interrelated and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets and  consequently  we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the excess liquidity and asset liability management policies described above 
cash flow analysis may  however  be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our business 
year ended november our cash and cash equivalents decreased by billion to billion at the end of we raised billion in net cash from financing activities  primarily in long term borrowings as well as through secured financings  partially offset by common stock repurchases 
we used net cash of billion in our operating and investing activities  primarily to capitalize on trading and investing opportunities for our clients and ourselves 
year ended november our cash and cash equivalents increased by billion to billion at the end of we raised billion in net cash from financing activities  primarily in long term borrowings  in light of the favorable debt financing environment  as well as through secured financings  partially offset by common stock repurchases 
we used net cash of billion in our operating and investing activities  primarily to capitalize on trading and investing opportunities for our clients and ourselves 

table of contents year ended november our cash and cash equivalents decreased by billion to billion at the end of we raised billion in net cash from financing activities  primarily in long term borrowings  in light of the favorable debt financing environment  as well as through secured financings 
we used net cash of billion in our operating and investing activities  primarily to capitalize on trading and investing opportunities for our clients and ourselves  to meet additional collateral requirements at securities exchanges and clearing organizations and to provide additional funding support for our william street loan commitments program 
operational risk operational risk relates to the risk of loss arising from shortcomings or failures in internal processes  people or systems  and from external events 
operational risk can arise from many factors ranging from routine processing errors to potentially costly incidents arising  for example  from major systems failures 
operational risk may also cause reputational harm 
thus  efforts to identify  manage and mitigate operational risk must be equally sensitive to the risk of reputational damage as well as the risk of financial loss 
we manage operational risk through the application of long standing  but continuously evolving  firmwide control standards the training  supervision and development of our people  the active participation and commitment of senior management in a continuous process of identifying and mitigating key operational risks across goldman sachs  and a framework of strong and independent control departments that monitor operational risk on a daily basis 
together  these elements form a strong firmwide control culture that serves as the foundation of our efforts to minimize events that create operational risk and the damage they can cause 
the operational risk department  an independent risk management function  is responsible for developing and implementing a standardized framework to identify  measure  monitor and manage operational risk across goldman sachs 
this framework  which evolves with the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance  takes into account internal and external operational risk events  business environment and internal control factors  the ongoing analysis of business specific risk metrics and the use of scenario analysis 
while individual business units have direct responsibility for the control and mitigation of operational risk  this framework provides a consistent methodology for identifying and monitoring operational risk factors at the business unit and firmwide level

recent accounting developments sfas no 
r 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in exchange for share based payments 
under sfas no 
r  the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments is generally measured based on the grant date fair value of the award 
under sfas no 
r  share based awards that do not require future service ie  vested awards are expensed immediately 
share based employee awards that require future service are amortized over the relevant service period 
we adopted sfas no 
r under the modified prospective adoption method 
under that method of adoption  the provisions of sfas no 
r are generally applied only to share based awards granted subsequent to adoption 
the accounting treatment of share based awards granted to retirement eligible employees prior to our adoption of sfas no 
r has not changed and financial statements for periods prior to adoption are not restated for the effects of adopting sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires the immediate expensing of share based awards granted to retirement eligible employees  including awards subject to non compete agreements 
share based awards held by employees that were retirement eligible on the date of adoption of sfas no 
r must continue to be amortized over the stated service period of the award and accelerated if the 
table of contents employee actually retires 
consequently  our compensation and benefits expenses in included and  to a lesser extent  and will include both the amortization of awards held by employees that were retirement eligible on the date of adoption of sfas no 
r as well as the full grant date fair value of new awards granted to such employees under sfas no 
r 
if we had amortized share based compensation prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r over a period beginning on the date of grant and ending on the earlier of the vesting date or the date of retirement eligibility  compensation and benefits expenses would have been million lower in  approximately million higher in and approximately million higher in sfas no 
r requires expected forfeitures to be included in determining share based employee compensation expense 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  forfeiture benefits were recorded as a reduction to compensation and benefits expense when an employee left goldman sachs and forfeited the award 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a benefit for expected forfeitures on all outstanding share based awards 
the transition impact of adopting sfas no 
r as of the first day of our fiscal year  including the effect of accruing for expected forfeitures on outstanding share based awards  was not material to our results of operations 
eitf issue no 
in june  the eitf reached consensus on issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights  which requires general partners to consolidate their partnerships or to provide limited partners with rights to remove the general partner or to terminate the partnership 
goldman sachs  as the general partner of numerous merchant banking and asset management partnerships  was required to adopt the provisions of eitf issue no 
i immediately for partnerships formed or modified after june  and ii in the first quarter of for partnerships formed on or before june  that have not been modified 
we have generally provided limited partners in these funds with rights to remove goldman sachs as the general partner or to terminate the partnerships 
therefore  the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows in for partnerships formed or modified after june  and is not expected to have a material effect in sfas no 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no

table of contents fin no 
in june  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
requires that management determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
once it is determined that a position meets this recognition threshold  the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
we expect to adopt the provisions of fin no 
beginning in the first quarter of we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin no 
on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
sfas no 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
sfas no 
nullifies the consensus reached in eitf issue no 
prohibiting the recognition of day one gain or loss on derivative contracts and hybrid instruments measured at fair value under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as modified by sfas no 
where we cannot verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model to market transactions 
however  sfas no 
requires that a fair value measurement technique include an adjustment for risks inherent in a particular valuation technique such as a pricing model and or the risks inherent in the inputs to the model  if market participants would also include such an adjustment 
in addition  sfas no 
prohibits the recognition of block discounts for large holdings of unrestricted financial instruments where quoted prices are readily and regularly available in an active market 
the provisions of sfas no 
are to be applied prospectively  except for changes in fair value measurements that result from the initial application of sfas no 
to existing derivative financial instruments measured under eitf issue no 
 existing hybrid instruments measured at fair value and block discounts  which are to be recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption 
we intend to adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of to determine the transition adjustment to opening retained earnings  we have performed an analysis of existing derivative instruments measured under eitf issue  hybrid financial instruments and block discounts 
to determine the prospective transition adjustment that will be recorded in net revenues in the first quarter of  we will perform an analysis of all other positions 
with respect to principal investments  the prospective transition adjustment may include positive changes to investment valuations based on available market evidence even if there have been no third party transactions in the capital structure of the underlying investee 
the transition adjustment to opening retained earnings will not have a material effect on our financial condition
