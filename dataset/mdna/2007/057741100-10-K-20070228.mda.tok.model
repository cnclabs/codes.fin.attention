item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview baldor is a leading manufacturer of industrial electric motors  drives  and generators  currently supplying over  customers in more than industries 
we sell our products to a diverse customer base consisting of original equipment manufacturers and distributors serving markets in the united states and throughout the world 
we focus on providing customers with value through a combination of quality products and customer service  as well as short lead times and attractive total cost of ownership  which takes into account initial product cost  product life  maintenance costs and energy consumption 
our financial performance is driven by industrial spending and the strength of the economies in which we sell our products generally  and is also influenced by 
table of contents investments in manufacturing capacity  including upgrades  modifications  and expansions of existing manufacturing facilities  and the creation of new manufacturing facilities  our customers needs for greater variety  timely delivery  and higher quality at a competitive cost  and our large installed base which creates a significant replacement demand 
our net sales were adversely affected during the us economic slowdown that began in mid and became an economic recession in and was characterized by weak industrial markets throughout and the us industrial economy began to strengthen in early and continued to grow through our financial performance is affected primarily by the us economy 
we are not dependent on any one industry or customer for our financial performance  with no single customer representing more than of our net sales for fiscal years ended   and for the fiscal year approximately of our domestic net sales were generated through distributors and represented primarily sales of replacement products 
for fiscal years and  approximately of our domestic net sales were generated through distributors  and also represented primarily sales of replacement products 
domestic sales to oems were approximately for fiscal year and approximately for fiscal years and oems primarily use our products in new installations 
this expands our installed base and leads to replacement product sales by distributors in the future 
we manufacture substantially all of our products 
consequently  our costs include the cost of raw materials  including steel  copper and aluminum  and energy costs 
each of these costs has increased in the past few years due to growing global demand for these commodities  impacting our cost of sales 
we seek to offset these increases in our costs through a continued focus on product design improvements  including redesigning our products to reduce material content and investing in capital equipment that assists in eliminating waste  and by modest price increases in our products 
our manufacturing facilities are also significant sources of fixed costs 
our margin is impacted when we cannot promptly decrease these costs to match declines in net sales 
industry trends the demand for products in the industrial electric motor  generator  and power transmission industries is closely tied to growth trends in the economy and levels of industrial activity and capital investment 
we believe that specific drivers of demand for our products include process automation  efforts in energy conservation and productivity improvement  regulatory and safety requirements  new technologies and replacement of worn parts 
our products are typically critical parts of customers end applications  and the end user s cost associated with their failure is high 
consequently  we believe that end users of our products base their purchasing decisions on quality  reliability and availability as well as customer service  rather than the price alone 
we believe that key success factors in our industry include strong reputation and brand preference  good customer service and technical support  product availability  and a strong distribution network 
results of operations we had record sales  net earnings  and diluted earnings per common share in total sales increased to million  net earnings increased to million and diluted earnings per common share increased to 
strong operating cash flows allowed us to continue investing in manufacturing equipment  increase dividends paid to our shareholders and repurchase stock 

table of contents compared to total sales for increased to million  compared to million in sales of industrial electric motor products grew during as compared to sales of super e high efficiency motors grew in as energy costs have increased  our super e high efficiency motors have become increasingly valuable to our industrial users 
industrial electric motors comprised of total product sales in compared to in during  sales of generator products declined from levels and comprised of total product sales in compared to in generator sales declined due to a decrease in military and hurricane region sales 
sales of generators from non military and non hurricane region sources increased indicating our growing presence in the industrial generator market 
sales of drives and motion control products increased in and accounted for of total product sales in compared to in gross margin was in and during  copper prices again reached record highs 
our continued focus on product design improvements  along with a modest price increase on our products  helped to offset the increased material costs and maintain a stable gross margin as compared to the gross margin  operating margin  and pretax margin were favorably impacted by adjustments to our self insurance liabilities amounting to of sales 
operating margin for improved to from in continued leverage of selling and administrative costs contributed to the improved operating margin 
pre tax margin was for and interest expense for increased approximately million over as a result of additional outstanding borrowings during the year and increased interest rates 
during second quarter  we borrowed an additional million to fund the repurchase of approximately million shares of our common stock from the estate of our former chairman and director  rs boreham  jr 
of the additional amount borrowed  million had been repaid by december  net earnings for of million were up from earnings of million 
diluted earnings per common share grew by to compared to in the adjustments to our self insurance liabilities during increased diluted earnings per common share by 
additionally  income tax liabilities were adjusted in due to the resolution of certain state tax liabilities resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per common share of 
compared to total sales for increased to million  compared to sales of million in sales of industrial electric motor products grew during and that growth was spread among most of the industries and geographical areas we serve 
large motors horsepower and super e high efficiency motors in all sizes had the strongest growth in as energy costs have increased  our super e high efficiency motors have become increasingly valuable to our industrial users 
industrial electric motors comprised of total product sales in compared to in during  sales of generator products rose from levels and comprised of total product sales in compared to in while a portion of the growth was related to the need for alternate power in areas affected by the hurricanes  we saw substantial growth in a number of customer markets 
sales of drives and motion control products declined in  following strong growth in during  we completed development of new motion control products and the first phase of our h series of drives 
drive products accounted for of total product sales in and in 
table of contents gross margin was in compared to in during  copper prices reached record highs  driving up the cost of our materials 
a continued focus on product design improvements  along with a modest price increase on our products  helped to mitigate the effects of increased material costs 
those initiatives combined with improved manufacturing efficiencies and increased sales volume accounted for most of the improvement in gross margin for during we adjusted certain self insurance liabilities to reflect current exposures  resulting in an increase in the gross margin of of sales 
operating margin for improved to from in selling and administrative expenses decreased to of sales in compared to in during we did not add substantial fixed selling and administrative costs 
as a result  total selling and administrative expenses for declined as a percentage of sales 
our ability to support increased sales volume without the addition of significant overhead  along with the product design improvements and manufacturing efficiencies  resulted in improved operating margin 
pre tax margin improved to for from in interest rates on outstanding long term debt facilities increased during in response  we utilized a portion of operating cash flows to reduce our debt by approximately million 
while we incurred more interest expense than in  we reduced our exposure to continued rising rates with the reduction of a portion of our variable rate debt 
net earnings for of million were up from earnings of million 
diluted earnings per common share grew by to compared to in adjustments to our self insurance liabilities during the fourth quarter of increased diluted eps by per common share 
in addition  income tax liabilities were adjusted in the fourth quarter of due to resolution of certain state tax liabilities  resulting in an increase in diluted eps of per common share 
these adjustments compared to adjustments of income tax liabilities made in the fourth quarter of increased diluted earnings per common share by 
international sales international sales foreign affiliates and exports increased in to a record million compared to million in and million in in  our export sales from the us to non affiliate customers increased or million 
sales from our european affiliates to foreign customers increased in compared to a decline of in this improvement was primarily due to new motion control products which became available in early we expect to see continued growth in the motion control products during environmental remediation we believe  based on our internal reviews and other factors  that any future costs relating to environmental remediation and compliance will not have a material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings  cash flows  or competitive position 
financial position baldor s financial position remained strong through we continued to increase our financial strength while investing in research and development for new and existing products  making capital investments in our manufacturing facilities and information systems  expanding into new markets  and continuing to invest in both our employees and customers education and training 
we believe the investment in our employees through training and education is a key to continued success and improved shareholder value 
investments in property  plant and equipment  and information systems amounted to million in  million in  and million in these investments were made primarily to improve quality and productivity 
our commitment to research and development continues to help us maintain a leadership position in the marketplace and satisfy customers needs 
investments in research and development amounted to million in  million in  and million in 
table of contents we continue to make investments in new product development as well as in existing products for improved performance  increased energy efficiency  and manufacturability 
liquidity and capital resources working capital amounted to million at december   and million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at year end  compared to to at the end of fiscal year liquidity was supported by cash flows from operations of million in  million in  and million in increased sales in required increased investments in accounts receivable and inventories 
accounts receivable increased million in compared to million in inventories increased million in compared to a decrease of million in we continued to increase our turns on finished goods  resulting in finished goods inventories remaining virtually flat at the end of when compared to the end of however  increased production schedules resulting from strong customer order growth required additional investments in raw material inventories 
in addition  approximately million and million of generator inventory  classified in other assets  was transferred to our rental program in and  respectively  with no resulting effect on cash flows 
accounts payable increased million in compared to a decrease of million in  primarily due to increased production levels in and differences in the timing of cash disbursements between the two years  generating million additional cash flow in in we utilized cash flows from operations  along with accumulated cash and proceeds from the sale of marketable securities to fund property  plant and equipment additions of million  pay dividends of million to our shareholders and repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock for million 
of the shares repurchased in  approximately million were repurchased from the estate of r 
s 
boreham  jr  former chairman and director of the company 
in we utilized cash flows from operations to fund property  plant and equipment additions of million  pay dividends to our shareholders of million  repurchase approximately  shares of our common stock for million  and acquire the remaining minority interest in our australian affiliate for million 
during  operating cash flows and accumulated cash were utilized to fund property  plant and equipment additions of million and pay dividends to our shareholders of million 
total long term debt  including amounts classified as current maturities  was million at december   compared to million at december  in conjunction with our acquisition of the acquired business in january  we borrowed a total of billion under our senior secured credit facility and senior notes 
a portion of the proceeds from new borrowings were utilized to repay million of long term debt that existed at december  our principal source of liquidity has historically been operating cash flows 
accordingly  we are dependent primarily on continued demand for our products as well as collectibility of receivables from our customers 
our broad base of customers  industries and geographic areas served  as well as our favorable position in the marketplace  ensure that fluctuations in a particular customer s or industry s business will not have a material effect on our sales or collectibility of receivables 
following the acquisition of the acquired business  our primary sources of liquidity will be cash flows from operations as well as funds available under our senior secured credit facility 
we expect that ongoing requirements for debt service  operations  capital expenditures and dividends will be funded from these sources 

table of contents the table below summarizes baldor s contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by years total less than more than contractual obligations long term debt obligations a operating lease obligations other commercial commitments letters of credit a includes interest on both fixed and variable rate obligations 
interest associated with variable rate obligations is based upon interest rates in effect at december  the contractual amounts to be paid on variable rate obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates 
future changes in market interest rates could materially affect the contractual amounts to be paid 
dividend policy dividends paid to shareholders amounted to per common share in  per common share in  and per common share in there have been four dividend increases in the last five years and nine increases in the last ten years 
these increases were in line with baldor s policy of making increases periodically  as earnings and financial strength warrant 
the objective has been for shareholders to obtain dividend increases over time while also participating in baldor s growth 
terms of the financing related to the acquisition of the acquired business will limit our ability to increase dividends in the future 
market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in commodity prices  interest rates  concentrations of credit  and foreign exchange rates 
to maintain stable pricing for our customers  we enter into various hedging transactions as described below 
we are a purchaser of certain commodities  primarily copper  aluminum  and steel  and periodically utilize commodity futures and options for hedging purposes to reduce the effects of changing commodity prices 
generally  contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation 
contracts that are highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting 
at december   and december   all of our open positions were designated as cash flow hedges 
the underlying commodities hedged have a correlation to price changes of the derivative positions such that the values of the commodities hedged based on differences between commitment prices and market prices and the value of the derivative positions used to hedge these commodity obligations are inversely correlated 
management has determined that a hypothetical change in the fair value of open positions would not have a material effect on the our results of operations 
our interest rate risk is related to available for sale securities and long term debt 
due to the nature of our securities portfolio  anticipated interest rate risk is not material 
our long term debt obligations include certain notes payable to banks bearing interest at variable rates 
prior to the acquisition of the acquired business we managed our interest rate risk exposure by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt  such that a increase in variable borrowing rates would not have a material effect on our financial results 
the acquisition of the acquired business  completed on january   was partially financed with a billion senior secured credit facility bearing interest at a variable rate 
as a result of the increased amount of variable rate debt  we anticipate utilizing interest rate hedges to manage our future exposure to interest rate risk on long term debt obligations 
absent interest rate hedges  if the new credit facility was fully utilized  a movement in interest rate would impact interest expense by million annually 
our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables 
cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions 
table of contents and generally do not require collateral 
no single customer represented more than of net accounts receivable at december   or december  foreign affiliates generally conduct business in their respective local currencies which minimizes our foreign currency risk 
we do not anticipate the use of derivatives for managing foreign currency risk  but continue to monitor the effects of foreign currency exchange rates 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes the following are the critical accounting policies  which could have the most significant effect on baldor s reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 
revenue recognition we sell products to our customers fob shipping point 
title passes to the customer when the product is shipped 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when the product is shipped 
baldor has no further obligations associated with the product sale that would impact revenue recognition after the product is shipped 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis  current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions  and historical experience 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than anticipated  or for customer specific circumstances  such as financial difficulty 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined principally by the last in  first out lifo method  except for non us inventories  which are determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
the valuation of lifo inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time 
the net realizable value of inventory is reviewed on an on going basis  with consideration given to deterioration  obsolescence  and other factors 
if actual market conditions differ from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory values may be required 
self insurance liabilities baldor s self insurance programs primarily include product liability  workers compensation  and health 
we self insure from the first dollar of loss up to specified retention levels 
eligible losses in excess of self insurance retention levels and up to stated limits of liability are covered by policies purchased from third party insurers 
the aggregate self insurance liability is estimated using claims experience and risk exposure levels for the periods being valued and current conditions 
adjustments to the self insurance liabilities may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested at least annually for impairment 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first comparing management s estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
management utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
judgments and assumptions related to revenue  gross margin  operating expenses  interest  capital expenditures  cash flow  and market assumptions are inherent in these estimates 
as a result  use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could result in a fair value that differs from our estimate and ultimately results in the recognition of impairment charges in the financial statements 
we utilize various assumption scenarios in our discounted cash flow analysis 
the results of the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value 
table of contents of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a computation of the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with its related carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess 
if an impairment charge is incurred  it would negatively impact our results of operations and financial position 
we perform our annual analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and in any other period in which indicators of impairment warrant an additional analysis 
at december   goodwill amounted to million 
our preliminary estimate is that goodwill of approximately million will be recorded in related to the acquisition of the acquired business 
share based compensation beginning in fiscal year  baldor applies the fair value method  pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
r share based payments  in accounting for share based compensation plans 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fas r using the modified prospective transition method 
as a result  baldor recognizes the fair value of share based compensation over the vesting period of the related awards 
the fair value of the options is estimated using a black scholes option pricing formula 
the variables used in the option pricing formula for each grant are determined at the time of grant as follows volatility is based on the daily composite closing price of baldor s stock over a look back period of time that approximates the expected option life  risk free interest rates are based on the yield of us treasury strips as published in the wall street journal on the date of the grant for the expected option life  dividend yields are based on baldor s dividend yield published in the wall street journal on the date of the grant  and expected option life represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is estimated based on historical experience 
assumptions used in the fair value valuation are periodically monitored and adjusted to reflect current developments 
the volatility factor for options is greater than that used to value previous grants 
future expense may be higher than past pro forma expense because the greater volatility factor acts to increase the value of the granted options 
acquisition on january   we completed the acquisition of the acquired business from rockwell for approximately billion  consisting of billion in cash and approximately million shares of baldor common stock 
the cash portion of the purchase price was funded with proceeds from the issuance of  shares of our common stock at a price of per common share  proceeds from the issuance of million principal amount of senior notes due  and borrowings under a new billion senior secured credit facility 
the combination will extend our product offerings  provide a manufacturing base in china for the asian markets  increase our manufacturing capabilities and flexibility  strengthen our management team  and provide strong opportunities for synergies and cost savings
