recent accounting pronouncements in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
traditionally  there have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements the roll over method and the iron curtain method 
the roll over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement of the income statement including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method  on the other hand  focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement 
prior to august   the company utilized the roll over method for quantifying identified financial statement misstatements 
in sab  the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the roll over methods 

table of contents sab permits public companies to initially apply its provisions either by i restating prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been used or ii recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of august  with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
the company elected to record the effects of applying sab using the cumulative effect transition method and recorded an adjustment to reduce retained earnings by  in the first quarter of fiscal year however  upon subsequent review  the company concluded that  of this entry could have been corrected by recording other balance sheet only adjustments  not affecting retained earnings 
this correction would result in a net increase in retained earnings of  and can no longer be deemed material enough to be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment 
therefore  the company has reversed the cumulative effect adjustment recorded in the first quarter and reflected the remaining  as corrections to cost of operations and minority interest expense 
in june  the fasb issued fin  an interpretation of sfas fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and reduces the diversity in current practice associated with the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by defining a more likely than not threshold regarding the sustainability of the position 
the company is required to adopt fin in the fiscal year ended july  the company is currently evaluating the impact of fin on its financial statements and anticipates the impact to be immaterial 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurement fas  which established a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
fas is effective for financial statements issued with fiscal years beginning after november  the company is assessing the impact that the adoption of fas will have on its financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas 
the fair value option established by fas permits entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
fas is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  the company is currently assessing the impact of fas on its financial statements 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  impairment of long lived assets and contingencies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition the company s revenues are derived primarily from the professional and technical services performed by its employees or  in certain cases  by subcontractors engaged to perform on under contracts we enter into with our clients 
the revenues recognized  therefore  are derived from our ability to charge clients for those services under the contracts 
the company employs three major types of contracts cost plus contracts  fixed price contracts and time and materials contracts 
within each of the major contract types are variations on the basic contract mechanism 
fixed price contracts generally present the highest level of financial and performance risk  but often also provide the highest potential financial returns 
cost plus contracts present a lower risk  but generally provide lower returns and often include more onerous terms and conditions 
time and materials contracts generally represent the time spent by our professional staff at stated or negotiated billing rates 
fixed price contracts are accounted for on the percentage of completion method  wherein revenue is recognized as project progress occurs 
time and material contracts are accounted for over the period of performance  in proportion to the costs of performance  predominately based on labor hours incurred 
if an estimate of costs at completion on any contract indicates that a loss will be incurred  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period the loss becomes evident 
the use of the percentage of completion revenue recognition method requires the use of estimates and judgment regarding the project s expected revenues  costs and the extent of progress towards completion 
the company has a history of making reasonably dependable 
table of contents estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenue and contract completion costs 
however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is possible that completion costs may vary from estimates 
most of our percentage of completion projects follow a method which approximates the cost to cost method of determining the percentage of completion 
under the cost to cost method  we make periodic estimates of our progress towards project completion by analyzing costs incurred to date  plus an estimate of the amount of costs that we expect to incur until the completion of the project 
revenue is then calculated on a cumulative basis project to date as the total contract value multiplied by the current percentage of completion 
the revenue for the current period is calculated as cumulative revenues less project revenues already recognized 
the recognition of revenues and profit is dependent upon the accuracy of a variety of estimates 
such estimates are based on various judgments we make with respect to those factors and are difficult to accurately determine until the project is significantly underway 
for some contracts  using the cost to cost method in estimating percentage of completion may overstate the progress on the project 
for projects where the cost to cost method does not appropriately reflect the progress on the projects  we use alternative methods such as actual labor hours  for measuring progress on the project and recognize revenue accordingly 
for instance  in a project where a large amount of equipment is purchased or an extensive amount of mobilization is involved  including these costs in calculating the percentage of completion may overstate the actual progress on the project 
for these types of projects  actual labor hours spent on the project may be a more appropriate measure of the progress on the project 
the company s contracts with the us government contain provisions requiring compliance with the far  and the cas 
these regulations are generally applicable to all of the company s federal government contracts and are partially or fully incorporated in many local and state agency contracts 
they limit the recovery of certain specified indirect costs on contracts subject to the far 
cost plus contracts covered by the far provide for upward or downward adjustments if actual recoverable costs differ from the estimate billed 
most of our federal government contracts are subject to termination at the convenience of the client 
contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of such termination 
federal government contracts are subject to the far and some state and local governmental agencies require audits  which are performed for the most part by the epa office of inspector general epaoig 
the epaoig audits overhead rates  cost proposals  incurred government contract costs  and internal control systems 
during the course of its audits  the epaoig may question incurred costs if it believes we have accounted for such costs in a manner inconsistent with the requirements of the far or cas and recommend that our us government financial administrative contracting officer disallow such costs 
historically  we have not experienced significant disallowed costs as a result of such audits 
however  we can provide no assurance that the epaoig audits will not result in material disallowances of incurred costs in the future 
the company maintains reserves for cost disallowances on its cost based contracts as a result of government audits 
the company recently settled fiscal years thru for amounts within the anticipated range 
final rates have been negotiated under these audits through the company has estimated its exposure based on completed audits  historical experience and discussions with the government auditors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change  the company may be required to record additional charges for disallowed costs on its government contracts 
impairment losses the company recorded a million impairment loss on its analytical services center in fiscal year an estimate of the fair value of its assets was made based on external appraisals of the land and buildings and internal estimates of the realizable value of the equipment 
an impairment was necessary due to the uncertainty that the estimated future net cash flows would be sufficient to recover the carrying value of it long lived assets 
if estimates of the assets fair value or their related assumptions change  the company may be required to record additional impairment losses 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we reduce our accounts receivable and costs and accrued earnings in excess of billings on contracts in process by establishing an allowance for amounts that  in the future  may become uncollectible or unrealizable  respectively 
we determine our estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts based on management s judgments regarding our operating performance related to the adequacy of the services performed  the status of change orders and claims  our experience settling change orders and claims and the financial condition of our clients  which may be dependent on the type of client and current economic conditions that the client may be subject to 

table of contents deferred income taxes we use the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances based on our judgments and estimates are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in future operating results 
management believes that realization of deferred tax assets in excess of the valuation allowance is more likely than not 
our estimates are based on facts and circumstances in existence as well as interpretations of existing tax regulations and laws applied to the facts and circumstances  with the help of professional tax advisors 
therefore  we estimate and provide for amounts of additional income taxes that may be assessed by the various taxing authorities 
changes in corporate entities on may  one of the walsh peruvian minority shareholders sold of their shares in that subsidiary for  half of the shares were repurchased by the peruvian company  and the other half was purchased by walsh environmental scientists and engineers  llc the majority shareholder
