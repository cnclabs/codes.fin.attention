item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
covenants in the loan agreement may limit our ability to operate our business 
under the loan agreement with comerica  we are subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on our ability to convey  sell  lease  license  transfer or otherwise dispose of assets  to create  incur  assume  guarantee or be liable with respect to certain indebtedness  to grant liens  to pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments  and to make investments 
in addition  under the loan agreement we are required to maintain a balance of cash with comerica in an amount of not less than million and to maintain any other cash balances with either comerica or another financial institution covered by a control agreement for the benefit of comerica 
we are also subject to certain financial covenants with respect to a minimum liquidity ratio and  when the outstanding loan balances exceed million  minimum ebitda requirements 
if we default under the loan agreement because of a covenant breach or otherwise  all outstanding amounts could become immediately due and payable  which would negatively impact our liquidity and reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital needs  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
to service any future indebtedness and fund our working capital and capital expenditures  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on any indebtedness will depend upon our future operating performance and on our ability to generate cash flow in the future  which is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or that future borrowings  including borrowings under our loan agreement with comerica  will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay any indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
rises in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition 
the interest rates applicable to any amounts we borrow under the loan agreement with comerica will be indexed  at our election  to either comerica s prime rate or the libor rate 
if we elect comerica s prime rate for all or any portion of our borrowings  the interest rate will be variable 
an increase in prevailing interest rates would have an immediate effect on the interest rates charged on our variable rate debt  if any 
if prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on any debt we incur under the loan agreement  the increased interest expense could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our debt 
if we elect the libor rate for all or any portion of our borrowings  such libor rate will remain fixed only for a specified  limited period of time after the date of our election  after which we will be required to repay the borrowed amount  or elect a new interest rate indexed to either comerica s prime rate or the libor rate 
the new rate may be higher than the earlier interest rate applicable under the loan agreement 
we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient cash flow from our 
table of contents operating activities or other resources to service our future debt obligations  if any  particularly in an environment of rising interest rates 
our short operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 
we were incorporated in december and have only been conducting operations with respect to our zegerid family of products since january we commercially launched our first product in october our operations to date have involved organizing and staffing our company  acquiring  developing and securing our technology  undertaking product development and clinical trials for our products and commercially launching zegerid powder for oral suspension and zegerid capsules 
we have relatively limited experience selling and marketing our products  and we have not yet demonstrated an ability to achieve profitability with our products 
consequently  any predictions about our future performance may not be as accurate as they could be if we had more experience with successfully commercializing products 
changes in  or interpretations of  accounting rules and regulations  such as expensing of stock options  could result in unfavorable accounting charges or require us to change our compensation policies 
accounting methods and policies for specialty pharmaceutical companies  including policies governing revenue recognition  expenses  accounting for stock options and in process research and development costs are subject to further review  interpretation and guidance from relevant accounting authorities  including the securities and exchange commission 
changes to  or interpretations of  accounting methods or policies in the future may require us to reclassify  restate or otherwise change or revise our financial statements  including those contained in this report 
for example  effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 
r  which requires us to treat the fair value of stock options granted to employees as an expense 
prior to january   we were generally not required to record compensation expense in connection with stock option grants to employees  and we have relied heavily on stock options to motivate existing employees and attract new employees 
the change had a significant impact on our results of operations for the year ended december  the specific impact of the new standard in future periods  however  cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of stock options or other share based payments granted and the possible variability in the valuation assumptions used in the future 
the requirement to expense the fair value of stock option grants may reduce the attractiveness of granting stock options 
if we reduce our use of stock options  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees 
risks related to our intellectual property the protection of our intellectual property rights is critical to our success and any failure on our part to adequately secure such rights would materially affect our business 
we regard the protection of patents  trademarks and other proprietary rights that we own or license as critical to our success and competitive position 
laws and contractual restrictions  however  may not be sufficient to prevent unauthorized use or misappropriation of our technology or deter others from independently developing products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products 
patents 
our commercial success will depend in part on the patent rights we have licensed or will license and on patent protection for our own inventions related to the products that we market and intend to market 
our success also depends on maintaining these patent rights against third party challenges to their validity  scope or enforceability 
our patent position is subject to uncertainties similar to other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies 
for example  the us patent and trademark office  or pto  or the courts may deny  narrow or invalidate patent claims  particularly those that concern biotechnology and pharmaceutical inventions 
we may not be successful in securing or maintaining proprietary or patent protection for our products  and protection that we have and do secure may be challenged and possibly lost 
our competitors may develop products similar to ours using methods and technologies that are beyond the scope of our intellectual property rights 
other 
table of contents drug companies may be able to develop generic versions of our products if we are unable to maintain our proprietary rights 
for example  although we believe that we have valid patent protection in the us for our products until at least  it is possible that generic drug makers will attempt to introduce generic immediate release omeprazole products similar to ours prior to the expiration of our patents 
any patents related specifically to our zegerid products will be method and or formulation patents and will not protect the use of the active pharmaceutical ingredient outside of the formulations covered by the patents and patent applications licensed to or owned by us 
in addition  our competitors or other third parties  including generic drug companies  may challenge the scope  validity or enforceability of our patent claims 
as a result  these patents may be narrowed in scope  invalidated or deemed unenforceable and may fail to provide us with any market exclusivity or competitive advantage even after our investment of significant amounts of money 
we also may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights against third party infringement  which may be difficult to detect 
if we become involved in any dispute regarding our intellectual property rights  regardless of whether we prevail  we could be required to engage in costly  distracting and time consuming litigation that could harm our business 
to date  five us patents have been issued relating to technology we license from the university of missouri and several us patent applications are pending 
in addition to the us patent coverage  several international patents have issued  including in australia  mexico  new zealand  russia  south africa  and singapore  and several international patent applications are pending  which are subject to the university of missouri license agreement 
we also received a notice of grant of a european patent organization  or epo  patent application  which is subject to the university of missouri license agreement 
the issued claims in these international patents vary between the different countries and include claims covering pharmaceutical compositions combining ppis with buffering agents and the use of these compositions in the manufacture of drug products for the treatment of gi disorders 
the initial us patent from the university of missouri does not have corresponding international or foreign counterpart applications and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain foreign patent rights to protect each of our products in all foreign countries of interest 
we consult with the university of missouri in its pursuit of the patent applications that we have licensed  but the university of missouri remains primarily responsible for prosecution of the applications 
we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that the university of missouri devotes on our behalf 
it may not assign as great a priority to prosecution of patent applications relating to technology we license as we would if we were undertaking such prosecution ourselves 
as a result of this lack of control and general uncertainties in the patent prosecution process  we cannot be sure that any additional patents will ever be issued 
issued patents generally require the payment of maintenance or similar fees to continue their validity 
we rely on the university of missouri to do this  subject to our obligation to provide reimbursement  and the university s failure to do so could result in the forfeiture of patents not maintained 
on august   an unidentified third party filed a request for ex parte reexamination of us patent no 
 in the pto 
us patent no 
 is one of five currently issued patents providing coverage for the zegerid family of products  which are licensed to us under our license agreement with the university of missouri 
us patent no 
 generally relates to methods for treating gastric acid related disorders by administering a composition consisting essentially of a ppi and a buffering agent  where a minimum serum concentration of the ppi is achieved within certain time periods 
we subsequently have received notice that the pto had granted the request for reexamination and had issued an initial office action  to which we have submitted a response 
the reexamination process is provided for by law and requires the pto to consider the scope and validity of the patent based on substantial new questions of patentability raised by a third party or the pto 
because we and our licensor  the university of missouri  believe that the scope and validity of the patent claims are appropriate  we  in conjunction with the university of missouri  will vigorously defend the patent position 
it is not feasible to predict whether we and the university of missouri ultimately will succeed in maintaining the scope and validity of the claims of this patent during reexamination 
if the patent claims in this patent ultimately are narrowed substantially or invalidated by the pto  the extent of the patent coverage afforded to our zegerid family of products could be impaired  which could potentially harm our business and operating results 
on september   we received notice of the publication of grant of an epo patent application  which has claims relating to pharmaceutical compositions in the form of a non enteric coated tablet and comprising ppis and one or more buffers 
this application is licensed to us under our license agreement with the university of missouri 
under european law  third parties have the right to oppose the grant of this patent for nine months from the publication of the notice of the grant 
if opposed  we  in conjunction with the university of missouri  will be required to defend the scope and or validity of the published claims 
it is not possible to predict whether an 
table of contents opposition will be filed or whether we and the university of missouri would successfully maintain the scope and validity of the claims of this patent in defending an opposition 
if an opposition is filed and the published claims are ultimately narrowed or held invalid  the extent of the patent coverage in countries within the epo  could be impaired 
on august   an indian company filed a pre grant opposition to a pending indian patent application that is licensed to us under our license agreement with the university of missouri 
if we  in connection with the university of missouri  do not successfully defend the patent application against the pre grant opposition  we may not be able to obtain patent coverage for one or more of our zegerid products in india 
trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we also rely upon unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation in developing our products 
although we require our employees  consultants  advisors and current and prospective business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements prohibiting them from disclosing or taking our proprietary information and technology  these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary know how 
further  people who are not parties to confidentiality agreements may obtain access to our trade secrets or know how 
others may independently develop similar or equivalent trade secrets or know how 
if our confidential  proprietary information is divulged to third parties  including our competitors  our competitive position in the marketplace will be harmed and our ability to successfully penetrate our target markets could be severely compromised 
trademarks 
our trademarks are important to our success and competitive position 
we have received us and european union  or eu  trademark registration for our corporate name  santarus 
we also have received trademark registration in the us  canada and japan and have applied for trademark registration in the eu for our brand name  zegerid  and have applied for trademark registration for various other names and logos 
the eu trademark application for our brand name  zegerid  is currently in an opposition proceeding 
in addition  in canada  we have received a notice of allowance for our zegerid brand name  and we have until the end of to file a declaration of use or to request an extension 
any objections we receive from the pto  foreign trademark authorities or third parties relating to our pending applications could require us to incur significant expense in defending the objections or establishing alternative names 
there is no guarantee we will be able to secure any of our pending trademark applications with the pto or comparable foreign authorities 
if we do not adequately protect our rights in our various trademarks from infringement  any goodwill that has been developed in those marks would be lost or impaired 
we could also be forced to cease using any of our trademarks that are found to infringe upon or otherwise violate the trademark or service mark rights of another company  and  as a result  we could lose all the goodwill which has been developed in those marks and could be liable for damages caused by any such infringement or violation 
third parties may choose to file patent infringement claims against us  which litigation would be costly  time consuming and distracting to management and could be materially adverse to our business 
the products we currently market  and those we may market in the future  may infringe patent and other rights of third parties 
in addition  our competitors  many of which have substantially greater resources than us and have made significant investments in competing technologies or products  may seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use and sell products either in the us or international markets 
intellectual property litigation in the pharmaceutical industry is common  and we expect this to continue 
in particular  intellectual property litigation among companies targeting the treatment of upper gi diseases and disorders is particularly common and may increase due to the large market for these products 
astrazeneca plc  as well as other competitors and companies  including aaipharma  tap pharmaceutical products inc and takeda chemical industries ltd  hold various other patents relating to omeprazole and ppi products generally and could file an infringement suit claiming our current products infringe their patents 
our third party manufacturers may also receive claims of infringement and could be subject to injunctions and temporary or permanent exclusionary orders in the us or in the countries in which they are based 
while we believe that we would have meritorious defenses to such claims  the outcome of any such litigation is uncertain and defending such litigation would be expensive  time consuming and distracting to management 

table of contents if we or our third party manufacturers or suppliers are unsuccessful in any challenge to our rights to manufacture  market and sell our products  we may be required to license the disputed rights  if the holder of those rights is willing  or to cease manufacturing and marketing the challenged products  or  if possible  to modify our products to avoid infringing upon those rights 
if we or our third party manufacturers or suppliers are unsuccessful in defending our rights  we could be liable for royalties on past sales or more significant damages  and we could be required to obtain and pay for licenses if we are to continue to manufacture and sell our products 
these licenses may not be available and  if available  could require us to pay substantial upfront fees and future royalty payments 
any patent owner may seek preliminary injunctive relief in connection with an infringement claim  as well as a permanent injunction  and  if successful in the claim  may be entitled to lost profits from infringing sales  attorneys fees and interest and other amounts 
any damages could be increased if there is a finding of willful infringement 
even if we and our third party manufacturers and suppliers are successful in defending an infringement claim  the expense  time delay and burden on management of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our zegerid products depend on technology licensed from the university of missouri and any loss of our license rights would harm our business and seriously affect our ability to market our products 
our zegerid products are based on patented technology and technology for which patent applications are pending that we have exclusively licensed from the university of missouri 
a loss or adverse modification of our technology license from the university of missouri would materially harm our ability to develop and commercialize our current products and other products based on that licensed technology that we may attempt to develop or commercialize in the future 
the university of missouri may claim that new patents or new patent applications that result from new research performed by the university of missouri are not part of the licensed technology 
the licenses from the university of missouri expire in each country when the last patent for licensed technology expires in that country and the last patent application for licensed technology in that country is abandoned 
in addition  our rights under the university of missouri license are subject to early termination under specified circumstances  including our material and uncured breach of the license agreement or our bankruptcy or insolvency 
further  we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and sell products based on the technology we licensed from the university of missouri to meet market demand 
if we fail to meet these obligations in specified countries  after giving us an opportunity to cure the failure  the university of missouri can terminate our license or render it nonexclusive with respect to those countries 
to date  we believe we have met all of our obligations under the university of missouri agreement 
however  in the event that the university of missouri is able to terminate the license agreement for one of the reasons specified in the license agreement  we would lose our rights to develop  market and sell our current zegerid products and we would not be able to develop  market and sell future products based on those licensed technologies 
we may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers or otherwise breached the terms of agreements with former employers 
many of our employees were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies  including our competitors or potential competitors 
in addition  certain of our employees are parties to non compete  non solicitation and non disclosure agreements with their prior employers 
we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise breached these non compete and non solicitation agreements or used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers 
litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims 
even if we are successful in defending against these claims  litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management 
if we fail in defending such claims  in addition to paying money claims  we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel 
a loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize products  which could severely harm our business 

table of contents risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock our stock price may be volatile and you may not be able to sell your shares at an attractive price 
our common stock had not been publicly traded prior to our initial public offering  which was completed in april  and an active trading market may not be sustained 
we have not paid cash dividends since our inception and do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
therefore  investors will have to rely on appreciation in our stock price and a liquid trading market in order to achieve a gain on their investment 
the market prices for securities of specialty pharmaceutical companies in general have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future 
for example  during the year ended december   the trading prices for our common stock ranged from a high of to a low of  and on february   the closing trading price for our common stock was the trading price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate substantially as a result of one or more of the following factors announcements concerning our commercial progress and activities  product development programs  results of our clinical trials or status of our regulatory submissions  the publication of prescription trend data concerning our products or competitive products  regulatory developments and related announcements in the us  including announcements by the fda  and foreign countries  disputes or other developments concerning proprietary rights  including patents and trade secrets  litigation matters  and our ability to patent or otherwise protect our products and technologies  conditions or trends in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  fluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies or of the markets generally  changes in  or our failure to meet or exceed  investors and securities analysts expectations  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our or our competitors quarterly or annual operating results  sales of large blocks of our common stock  including sales by kingsbridge under the ceff  our executive officers  directors or venture capital investors  announcements concerning borrowings under the loan agreement  draw downs under the ceff  takedowns under our existing universal shelf registration statement or other developments relating to the loan agreement  ceff  universal shelf registration statement or our other financing activities  our entering into licenses  strategic partnerships and similar arrangements  or the termination of such arrangements  acquisition of products or businesses by us or our competitors  announcements made by  or events affecting  our otc collaborator  our co promotion partner  our contract sales force provider  our suppliers or other third parties that provide services to us  litigation and government inquiries  or economic and political factors  including wars  terrorism and political unrest 

table of contents our stock price could decline and our stockholders may suffer dilution in connection with future issuances of equity or debt securities 
although we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months  until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we likely will pursue raising additional funds in the next months to support the further commercialization of our zegerid products 
accordingly  we may conduct substantial future offerings of equity or debt securities  which  in turn  could cause our stock price to decline 
for example  we may issue additional shares of our common stock under our ceff with kingsbridge  we may issue securities under our existing universal shelf registration statement  or we may pursue alternative financing arrangements 
the exercise of outstanding options and warrants and future equity issuances  including future public offerings or future private placements of equity securities and any additional shares issued in connection with acquisitions  will also result in dilution to investors 
the market price of our common stock could fall as a result of resales of any of these shares of common stock due to an increased number of shares available for sale in the market 
future sales of our common stock by our stockholders may depress our stock price 
persons who were our stockholders prior to the sale of shares in our initial public offering may continue to hold a substantial number of shares of our common stock that they generally are currently able to sell in the public market 
significant portions of these shares are held by a small number of stockholders 
sales by our current stockholders of a substantial number of shares  or the expectation that such sales may occur  could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock 
similarly  sales by kingsbridge of any shares that we may sell to it under the ceff from time to time or upon the exercise of the warrant to purchase  shares of common stock that we issued to kingsbridge in connection with the ceff  or the expectation that sales may occur  could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock 
moreover  the holders of a substantial number of shares of common stock  including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants  may have rights  subject to certain conditions  to require us to file registration statements to permit the resale of their shares in the public market or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders 
we have also registered all common stock that we may issue under our employee benefits plans 
as a result  these shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance  subject to restrictions under the securities laws 
in addition  certain of our executive officers  including our president and chief executive officer  have established programmed selling plans under rule b of the securities exchange act for the purpose of effecting sales of common stock  and other employees and affiliates  including our directors and other executive officers  may choose to establish similar plans in the future 
if any of our stockholders cause a large number of securities to be sold in the public market  the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock 
these sales also could impede our ability to raise future capital 
we may become involved in securities or other class action litigation that could divert management s attention and harm our business 
the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
in addition  over the last year  several class action lawsuits have been filed against pharmaceutical companies alleging that the companies sales representatives have been misclassified as exempt employees under the federal fair labor standards act and applicable state laws 
to date  we are not aware of any court decisions on the merits of these lawsuits  and we cannot be certain as to how the lawsuits will ultimately be resolved 
although we have not been the subject of these types of lawsuits  we may be targeted in the future 
litigation often is expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business 

table of contents we are exposed to increased costs and risks related to complying with recently enacted and proposed changes in laws and regulations  including costs and risks associated with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and rules proposed by the securities and exchange commission and by the nasdaq global market  have resulted in increased costs to us 
in particular  we incur additional administrative expense in connection with the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls on an annual basis 
as part of our compliance with section  we also rely on the continued effectiveness and adequacy of the internal controls at our key service providers 
in addition  the new rules could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including directors and officers liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board  our board committees or as executive officers 
we cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
if we  or the third party service providers on which we rely  fail to comply with any of these laws or regulations  or if our auditors cannot timely attest to our evaluation of our internal controls  we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our corporate governance or internal controls  which could have an adverse effect on our business and our stock price 
anti takeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders  which could adversely affect our stock price and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control  discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 
these provisions include dividing our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three year terms  prohibiting our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders  permitting the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock without stockholder approval  prohibiting our stockholders from making certain changes to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws except with stockholder approval  and requiring advance notice for raising business matters or nominating directors at stockholders meetings 
we are also subject to provisions of the delaware corporation law that  in general  prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of or more of our common stock for five years unless the holder s acquisition of our stock was approved in advance by our board of directors 
together  these charter and statutory provisions could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock 
in addition  in november  we adopted a stockholder rights plan  which was subsequently amended in april although the rights plan will not prevent a takeover  it is intended to encourage anyone seeking to acquire our company to negotiate with our board prior to attempting a takeover by potentially significantly diluting an acquirer s ownership interest in our outstanding capital stock 
the existence of the rights plan may also discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock

this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in any forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring  developing and commercializing proprietary products that address the needs of patients treated by gastroenterologists or primary care physicians 
the primary focus of our current efforts is the commercialization of proprietary immediate release proton pump inhibitor  or ppi  products 
ppi products are the most frequently prescribed drugs for the treatment of many upper gastrointestinal  or gi  diseases and disorders  including gastroesophageal reflux disease  or gerd 
our zegerid products are the first immediate release oral ppis to be developed for the us pharmaceutical market 
the formulations are based on patented technology and utilize antacids  which raise the gastric ph and thus protect the ppi  omeprazole  from acid degradation in the stomach  allowing the omeprazole to be quickly absorbed into the bloodstream 
although other marketed oral ppis enjoy widespread use due to their potent acid suppression  favorable safety profiles and once a day dosing  they are available only in delayed release  enteric coated formulations 
while the enteric coatings protect delayed release ppis from acid degradation in the stomach  they also delay absorption until the delayed release ppis reach the alkaline environment of the small intestine  where the enteric coatings dissolve 
our immediate release zegerid products are designed to provide rapid release and continued nighttime and daytime acid control the products are not enterically coated and are designed to be released and absorbed more rapidly  while providing a duration of acid control comparable to delayed release ppis 
we received approval from the us food and drug administration  or fda  to market zegerid omeprazole sodium bicarbonate capsules in february for the treatment of heartburn and other symptoms associated with gerd  treatment and maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis and treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcers 
we received approval from the fda to market zegerid omeprazole sodium bicarbonate powder for oral suspension for these same indications in in addition  zegerid powder for oral suspension is approved for the reduction of risk of upper gi bleeding in critically ill patients  and is currently the only ppi product approved for this indication 
we commercially launched zegerid capsules mg and mg in late march  and launched zegerid powder for oral suspension mg in october and mg in february we have also developed an immediate release omeprazole product in a chewable tablet formulation and received approval from the fda to market the chewable tablet product in march given our current near term focus on commercializing zegerid capsules and zegerid powder for oral suspension  we have not commercially launched the chewable tablet product and do not currently anticipate launching the product during the next months 

table of contents as a result of a recent expansion of our commercial presence  zegerid capsules and zegerid powder for oral suspension are now supported by more than field sales representatives who promote our zegerid products in the primary detail position 
the field sales representatives include approximately of our own representatives and representatives under our co promotion agreement with otsuka america pharmaceutical  inc  or otsuka america 
in addition  the field sales representatives include approximately inventiv commercial services  llc  or inventiv  contract sales representatives  under a services agreement that we announced in november in addition  we utilize field based district sales managers and regional sales directors to oversee the activities of our field sales representatives and national and regional account managers to work with managed care organizations to obtain formulary and reimbursement coverage for our products 
we also use a variety of marketing programs to promote our products  including promotional materials  speaker programs  journal advertising  industry publications  electronic media and product sampling 
in january  we entered into an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with the university of missouri  under which we licensed rights to all of its patents and patent applications relating to specific formulations of immediate release ppis with antacids for treating upper gi diseases and disorders 
this licensed technology forms the basis of our zegerid family of products 
we paid the university of missouri an upfront licensing fee of million in and a one time million milestone fee upon the filing of our first new drug application  or nda  in in july  we paid a one time million milestone fee based upon the fda s approval of zegerid powder for oral suspension mg  and we are required to make additional milestone payments to the university of missouri upon the achievement of certain regulatory events related to obtaining approvals outside the us  which may total up to million in the aggregate 
we are required to make milestone payments  up to a maximum of million  based on first time achievement of significant sales thresholds  and to pay royalties on net sales of our products 
in june  under a strategic sublicense agreement  we granted tap pharmaceutical products inc  or tap  the north american rights to develop  manufacture and sell products resulting from the use of our immediate release ppi technology with lansoprazole and derivatives of lansoprazole 
we received an upfront fee of million in july and a million milestone payment in february related to tap s development activities 
we received the february milestone after we prevailed in an alternative dispute resolution proceeding in which we alleged that tap had achieved a development milestone 
we paid of the upfront fee and the february milestone to the university of missouri 
tap exercised its right to terminate the sublicense agreement effective march  we have a non exclusive agreement with otsuka america  under which otsuka america is co promoting zegerid capsules and zegerid powder for oral suspension to targeted us physicians 
we originally entered into the agreement in october and amended the terms of the agreement in january under the agreement  we received a million upfront payment from otsuka america  and have agreed to pay otsuka america a royalty on total us net sales of zegerid capsules and zegerid powder for oral suspension 
the agreement will terminate automatically on december   unless terminated sooner 
in addition to other more limited termination rights  either party may terminate the agreement at any time following june   by providing at least days prior written notice 
in october  we entered into a license agreement with schering plough healthcare products  inc  or schering plough  granting rights to develop  manufacture  market and sell omeprazole products using our patented ppi technology for the over the counter  or otc  market in the us and canada 
in november  we received a million upfront license fee 
we may receive up to an additional million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones 
we will also receive low double digit royalties  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  on net sales of any otc products sold by schering plough under the license agreement 
in turn  we will be obligated to pay royalties to the university of missouri based on net sales of any otc products sold by schering plough 
the license agreement will remain in effect as long as schering plough is marketing products under the license agreement in the us or canada 
schering plough may terminate the agreement on days prior written notice anytime after submitting its first new drug application for a licensed product or if schering plough does not meet a specified deadline for receiving marketing approval in the us for a 
table of contents licensed product 
in addition  either party may terminate the agreement in the event of uncured material breach of a material obligation  subject to certain limitations  or in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with license fees  research and development activities  including costs of clinical trial activities associated with our current products  commercialization activities and general and administrative expenses 
we expect to incur additional operating losses and capital expenditures as we support the commercialization of zegerid capsules and zegerid powder for oral suspension and our commercial organization  enhance our product portfolio through development and commercialization of acquired or internally developed proprietary products and fund our administrative support activities 
on may   we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s covering equity or debt securities with the securities and exchange commission  which was declared effective on june  in august  we completed an offering of  shares of common stock registered under the universal shelf registration statement at a price of per share  raising net proceeds of approximately million  net of placement agents fees and offering costs 
in february  we entered into a committed equity financing facility  or ceff  with kingsbridge capital limited  or kingsbridge  which may entitle us to sell and obligate kingsbridge to purchase  from time to time over a period of three years  shares of our common stock for cash consideration up to the lesser of million or  shares  subject to certain conditions and restrictions 
in connection with the ceff  we entered into a common stock purchase agreement and registration rights agreement  and we also issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the warrant is fully exercisable beginning after the six month anniversary of the agreement for a period of five years thereafter 
on february   we filed a resale shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission to facilitate kingsbridge s public resale of shares of our common stock which it may acquire from us from time to time in connection with our draw downs under the ceff or upon the exercise of a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock that we issued to kingsbridge in connection with the ceff 
the resale shelf registration statement was declared effective on february  in  we completed four draw downs under the ceff and have issued a total of  shares in exchange for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
in july  we entered into a loan and security agreement  or the loan agreement  with comerica bank  or comerica 
the credit facility under our loan agreement consists of a revolving line of credit  pursuant to which we may request advances in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed million 
as of march   the date of this report  we have not borrowed any amounts under the loan agreement 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note to our financial statements included in this form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we follow the provisions of staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  and recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  title has passed  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 

table of contents product sales  net 
we sell our zegerid products primarily to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors 
we are obligated to accept from customers the return of products that are within six months of their expiration date or up to months beyond their expiration date 
we authorize returns for damaged products and exchanges for expired products in accordance with our return goods policy and procedures  and have established allowances for such amounts at the time of sale 
we commercially launched zegerid capsules in late march and launched zegerid powder for oral suspension mg in late and the mg dosage strength in early we recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with sab no 
and statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
among its criteria for revenue recognition from sale transactions where a buyer has a right of return  sfas no 
requires the amount of future returns to be reasonably estimated 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we were unable to reasonably estimate the amount of future product returns  and therefore  deferred the recognition of revenue on product shipments of our zegerid products until units were dispensed through patient prescriptions 
units dispensed are not generally subject to return 
prior to the fourth quarter of  our allowance for product returns was based on an analysis of zegerid product shipments to our wholesale distributors in excess of units dispensed through patient prescriptions 
in order to develop a methodology and provide a basis for estimating future product returns on sales to our customers at the time title transfers  we have been tracking our zegerid products return history  taking into consideration product expiration dating and inventory levels in the distribution channel 
based on the product returns history gathered through the end of  we determined that we had the information needed to reasonably estimate future product returns  and as a result  we reduced our allowance for product returns during the quarter ended december  and recognized net product sales of million in  representing revenue previously deferred  net of contractual allowances and other discounts 
as a result of our ability to estimate product returns at the time the title passes to our customers  our net loss was reduced by million in  representing million in net product sales  partially offset by the related cost of sales and royalties 
we will continue to recognize product sales at the time title passes to our customers  and we will provide for an estimate of future product returns at that time based upon our historical product returns trends and analysis of product expiration dating and inventory levels in the distribution channel 
we recognize product sales net of estimated allowances for product returns  managed care rebates  reimbursements relating to medicaid and medicare  patient coupons  chargebacks from distributors  wholesaler fees and prompt payment and other discounts 
our estimates for product returns and sales allowances take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends  internal and external historical data  and sales trends and forecasts 
there may be a significant time lag between the date we determine the estimated allowance and when we make the contractual payment or issue credit to a customer 
due to this time lag  we record adjustments to our estimated allowances over several periods  which can result in a net increase in our net loss or a net decrease in our net loss in those periods 
to date  actual results have not materially differed from our estimates 
such estimates require our most subjective and complex judgment due to the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual future payments for returns  rebates  coupons  chargebacks and other discounts exceed the estimates we made at the time of sale  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted 
contract revenue 
we recognize contract revenue consistent with the provisions of sab no 
and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we analyze each element of our licensing and co promotion agreements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on upfront payments over the period of significant involvement under the related agreements unless the fee is in exchange for products delivered or services rendered that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process and no further performance obligation exists under the contract 
we recognize milestone payments upon the achievement of specified milestones if the milestone is substantive in nature  and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and the fees are nonrefundable 
any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria are recognized as deferred revenue 
sales milestones and royalties will be recognized when earned under the agreements 
certain elements of our licensing and co promotion agreements are described below in november  we received a nonrefundable million upfront license fee in connection with our license agreement with schering plough 
the million upfront payment is being amortized to revenue 
table of contents on a straight line basis over a month period through the end of which represents the estimated period over which we have significant responsibilities under the agreement 
in february  we received a million milestone payment in connection with our sublicense agreement with tap 
we received the milestone payment after we prevailed in an alternative dispute resolution proceeding in which we alleged that tap had achieved a development milestone 
pursuant to our license agreement with the university of missouri  we paid of the february milestone to the university of missouri 
in addition to the provisions of sab no 
and eitf issue no 
 we evaluated the criteria outlined in eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it was appropriate to record the gross amount of sublicense revenues and related costs or the net amount earned under the arrangement 
upon receipt of the milestone  we recognized the gross amount of sublicense revenue and related costs as we had no future obligations pursuant to the arrangement  we were the primary obligor in the arrangement  we had latitude in establishing the amounts received under the arrangement  and we were involved in the determination of the scope of technology sublicensed under the agreement 
in october  we received a nonrefundable million upfront payment in connection with our co promotion agreement with otsuka america 
the million upfront payment is being amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over the month contractual term through the end of inventories and related reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost fifo or market and consist of finished goods and raw materials used in the manufacture of our zegerid capsules and zegerid powder for oral suspension products 
we provide reserves for potentially excess  dated or obsolete inventories based on an analysis of inventory on hand and on firm purchase commitments compared to forecasts of future sales 
stock based compensation prior to january   as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options when the exercise price was equal to or in excess of the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized for the year ended december  included a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights granted using the black scholes valuation model 
this estimate is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected volatility of our stock price  expected term of the stock option  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
as the length of time our shares have been publicly traded is shorter than the expected life of the option  we consider the expected volatility of similar entities as well as our historical volatility since our initial public offering in april in determining our volatility factor 
in evaluating similar entities  we consider factors such as industry  stage of development  size and financial leverage 
in determining the expected life of the options  we use the short cut method described in sab no 
under this method  the expected life is presumed to be the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
for options granted prior to january   we amortize the fair value on an accelerated basis 
for options granted after january   we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the requisite service period of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
pre vesting forfeitures were estimated to be approximately for the year ended december  as the majority of options granted contain monthly vesting terms 

table of contents we account for options issued to non employees under sfas no 
r and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity investments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
as such  the value of options issued to non employees is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest 
for the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r and eitf issue no 
for the year ended december   stock based compensation of approximately  million and million was included in cost of sales  research and development  and selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively  in the accompanying statement of operations 
as of december   total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options was approximately million  and the weighted average period over which it is expected to be recognized is years 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap 
there are also areas in which our management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
please see our audited financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and product sales  net

cost of sales also includes reserves for excess  dated or obsolete commercial inventories based on an analysis of inventory on hand and on firm purchase commitments compared to forecasts of future sales 
the decrease in our cost of sales as a percentage of net product sales from to was primarily attributable to lower manufacturing costs associated with our capsule product and certain fixed costs being applied to increased sales volumes 
based upon review of initial prescription trends for zegerid powder for oral suspension 
table of contents mg subsequent to its commercial launch in october  and in light of our receipt of fda approval to market zegerid powder for oral suspension mg in december  commercial inventory reserves of approximately million were recorded in cost of sales in license fees and royalties

research and development expenses have consisted primarily of costs associated with clinical trials of our products under development as well as clinical studies designed to further differentiate our zegerid products from those of our competitors  development of and preparation for commercial manufacturing of our products  compensation and other expenses related to research and development personnel and facilities expenses 
in the future  we may conduct additional clinical trials to further differentiate our zegerid family of products 
we have also committed  in connection with the approval of our ndas for zegerid powder for oral suspension  to evaluate the product in pediatric populations  including pk pd and safety studies 
we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our zegerid family of products 
although we are currently marketing zegerid capsules and zegerid powder for oral suspension  and we have received fda approval to market zegerid chewable tablets  we cannot be certain when or if we will realize any profits from these products or any other development projects 
although we are currently focused primarily on advancing our zegerid family of products  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific  clinical and commercial merits of each project 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for  million for and million for the million increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily attributable to approximately million of additional stock based compensation expense recognized due to our adoption of sfas no

amounts borrowed under the loan agreement may be repaid and re borrowed at any time prior to july  the loan agreement will remain in full force and effect for so long as any obligations remain outstanding or comerica has any obligation to make credit extensions under the loan agreement 
we expect to use the loan proceeds to support our ongoing working capital needs and for general corporate purposes 
amounts borrowed under the loan agreement are secured by all of our personal property 
the collateral does not include any intellectual property  including copyrights  patents  trademarks  servicemarks and applications therefor  now owned or hereafter acquired  or any claims for damages by way of any past  present and future infringement of any such intellectual property  provided  however  that the collateral includes all accounts and general intangibles that consist of rights to payment and proceeds from the sale  licensing or disposition of all or any part  or rights in  such intellectual property 
under the loan agreement  we are subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on our ability to convey  sell  lease  license  transfer or otherwise dispose of assets  to create  incur  assume  guarantee or be liable with respect to certain indebtedness  to grant liens  to pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments  and to make investments 
in addition  under the loan agreement we are required to maintain a balance of cash with comerica in an amount of not less than million and to maintain any other cash balances with either comerica or another financial institution covered by a control agreement for the benefit of comerica 
we are also subject to certain financial covenants with respect to a minimum liquidity ratio and  when the outstanding loan balances exceed million  minimum ebitda requirements 
we believe that we have currently met all of our obligations under the loan agreement 
we cannot be certain that our existing cash and marketable securities resources  including under the ceff and the loan agreement  will be adequate  and failure to obtain adequate financing may adversely affect our ability to continue to operate as a going concern 
we also cannot be certain that additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
for example  we may not be successful in obtaining collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements 
in addition  if we raise additional funds through collaboration  licensing or other similar arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our products or proprietary technologies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders ownership will be diluted 
any debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations 
if adequate funds are not available on terms acceptable to us at that time  our ability to achieve profitability or to respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited  and we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our product and clinical development programs or delay the launch of future products 
as of december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under the terms of our loan agreement with comerica  the interest rate applicable to any amounts borrowed by us under the credit facility will be  at our election  indexed to either comerica s prime rate or the libor rate 
if we elect comerica s prime rate for all or any portion of our borrowings  the interest rate will be variable  which would expose us to the risk of increased interest expense if interest rates rise 
if we elect the libor rate for all or any portion of our borrowings  such libor rate will remain fixed only for a specified  limited period of time after the date of our election  after which we will be required to repay the borrowed amount  or elect a new interest rate indexed to either comerica s prime rate or the libor rate 
the new rate may be higher than the earlier interest rate applicable under the loan agreement 
as of march   the date of this report  we have not borrowed any amounts under the loan agreement 
accordingly  we currently believe that changes in such interest rates would not materially affect our market risk 
in addition to market risk related to our loan agreement with comerica  we are exposed to market risk in the form of interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments
