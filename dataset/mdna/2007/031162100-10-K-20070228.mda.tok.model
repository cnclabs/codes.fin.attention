item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for further information regarding our consolidated results of operations and financial position for periods reported therein and for known factors that will impact comparability of future results 
we began recording enbrel sales subsequent to our acquisition of immunex in july included in operating expenses are acquisition charges of million  million  million  million and million  in    and  respectively 
acquisition charges consist of the incremental compensation provided to certain employees under short term retention plans  including non cash compensation expense associated with stock options assumed in connection with the acquisition  non cash expense related to valuing the inventory acquired at fair value and external  incremental consulting and systems integration costs directly associated with integrating the acquisition 
as part of the accounting for the acquisitions of avidia and abgenix in  tularik in and immunex in  we recorded charges to write off acquired ipr d of million and  million in  million in and  million in the ipr d charge represents an estimate of the fair value of the in process r d for projects and technologies that  as of the acquisition date  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
in october  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of avidia for a net purchase price of approximately million 
in april  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of abgenix for a purchase price of approximately billion 
in august  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of tularik for a purchase price of approximately billion 
in july  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of immunex for a purchase price of approximately billion 
in february  we issued billion principal amount of convertible notes due in the convertible notes and billion principal amount of convertible notes due in the convertible notes in a private placement 
the convertible notes and the convertible notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of and  respectively 
in connection with the issuance of these notes  a total of billion of our common stock was repurchased under our stock repurchase program 
also  concurrent with the issuance of these notes  we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions 
the cost of the convertible note hedges  which aggregated approximately billion  was recorded as a reduction of equity 
also  concurrent with the issuance of these notes  we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock 
proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately million 
in march  we issued convertible notes with a face amount at maturity of billion 
holders of the convertible notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates  the earliest of which was march   at the accreted principal amount through the purchase dates 
on march   as a result of certain holders of the convertible notes exercising their march  put option  we repurchased billion  or approximately  of the outstanding convertible notes at their then accreted value for cash 
accordingly  the convertible notes repurchased were classified as current liabilities at december  holders of the remaining outstanding convertible notes may require us to purchase  generally for cash  all or a portion of the notes on various dates at a price equal to the accreted principal amount through the purchase date 
the next available put date was march   however  the holders of substantially all of the then outstanding convertible notes did not require us to repurchase such notes on this date 
accordingly  as of december   the convertible notes were classified as non current liabilities 
the next date that the holders of these notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of these notes is on march  accordingly  as of december   the convertible notes were classified as current liabilities 
in november  we issued billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in and billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in we have a share repurchase program through which we have repurchased billion  billion  billion  billion and billion of amgen common stock in    and  respectively

overview the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to assist the reader in understanding the business of amgen inc  including its subsidiaries referred to as amgen  we  our and us 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we are a global biotechnology company that discovers  develops  manufactures and markets human therapeutics based on advances in cellular and molecular biology 
our mission is to serve patients 
as a science based  patient focused organization  we discover and develop innovative therapies to treat grievous illness 
we operate in one business segment human therapeutics 
therefore  our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis 
we primarily earn revenues and income and generate cash from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care  nephrology and inflammation 
our principal products include aranesp  neulasta neupogen  epogen and enbrel 
enbrel is marketed under a co promotion agreement with wyeth in the united states and canada 
see item business principal products for additional information about our principal products  their approved indications and where they are marketed 
in october  we launched vectibix  our first cancer therapeutic  after receiving fda approval in late september 
product sales of vectibix were not significant for for the year ended december   total revenues were  million and net income was  million  or per share on a diluted basis 
the results of our operations for the year ended december  reflect the million and billion write offs of acquired ipr d costs associated with the avidia and abgenix acquisitions  respectively 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were billion  of which approximately billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use outside the united states 
our total debt outstanding was billion as of december  for both years ended december  and  product sales represented of total revenues  which was mainly comprised of our principal products 
over the last several years  our product sales growth has been 
table of contents primarily driven by sales of aranesp  neulasta and enbrel  which have benefited primarily from share gains and or segment growth 
we expect these products to continue to drive year over year sales growth in the near term and that vectibix will also contribute to this growth 
however  we believe that maintaining or increasing share will be more of a challenge than in previous years as we experienced share loss with enbrel in compared to and we operate in an increasingly competitive environment 
for example  roche is developing a peg epo product for the united states for which they have filed a bla with the fda and have announced plans to launch in the nephrology segment in despite our ongoing lawsuit and their acknowledgement of our us erythropoietin patents see item legal proceedings roche matters amgen inc v

hoffmann la roche ltd  et al 
see item business competition for further information on the impact of competition on our business 
in addition  as discussed below  we also anticipate increased competition internationally from biosimilar and other competing products 
going forward  we will focus on growing our segments  including increasing our penetration in the therapeutic areas in which our products are used  while also continuing to focus on maintaining or increasing share 
over the last few years  our principal products have attained significant sales levels and have experienced strong year over year sales growth 
however  the rate of growth has declined in each of the past several years and  in the near term  we expect this trend will continue 
most patients receiving aranesp and neulasta neupogen for approved indications are covered by both government and private payer healthcare programs 
in the united states  approved dialysis providers are primarily reimbursed for epogen by the federal government through the esrd program of medicare 
the esrd program reimburses of allowed dialysis costs  with the remainder being paid by other sources including patients  state medicaid programs  private insurance and  to a lesser extent  state kidney patient programs 
beginning in the first quarter of  enbrel and sensipar also became eligible for coverage from the us government under medicare program part d 
generally  in europe and other countries outside the us  the government sponsored healthcare system is the primary payer of healthcare costs of patients 
governments may regulate access to  prices or reimbursement levels of our products to control costs 
worldwide use of our products may be affected by these cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers to healthcare providers in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce healthcare expenditures 
therefore  sales of our principal products and sales growth are  and will be  affected by the availability and extent of reimbursement from third party payers  including government and private insurance plans 
while we believe that our product sales for and have not been nor  for  are expected to be significantly impacted by the reimbursement changes resulting from the mma enacted in  additional provisions of the mma and other regulations affecting reimbursement that have gone  or may go  into effect could affect our product sales and related sales growth in the future 
for additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business  see item business reimbursement 
international product sales for both years ended december  and represented of total product sales and consisted principally of european sales 
international product sales have grown significantly over the last several years driven by aranesp and neulasta reflecting continued penetration 
however  we anticipate facing greater competition in europe from the availability of biosimilar and other competing products 
although we cannot predict with certainty when the first biosimilar products could appear on the market in the eu  we believe that the first biosimilar g csf product  which would compete with neulasta and neupogen  and that the first biosimilar erythropoietin products  which would compete with aranesp  may be approved in and could be available in the eu shortly after approval 
based on an announcement by shire  we expect that a competing erythropoietin product  manufactured by shire  may appear on the market in the eu in in addition  roche is developing its peg epo product which  upon regulatory approval  we expect they will launch in the eu nephrology segment in we cannot predict whether or to what extent the entry of biosimilar or other competing products would impact future aranesp  neulasta or neupogen sales in the eu 
see item business competition for further information regarding biosimilar products 
our international product sales are impacted by foreign currency changes see results of operations discussion below 
international product sales growth during was unfavorably impacted by million  while was favorably impacted by million  from foreign currency exchange rate changes 
however  both the 
table of contents positive and negative impacts that movements in foreign exchange rates have on our international product sales are mitigated  in part  by the natural  opposite impact these exchange rate movements have on our international operating expenses and as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities 
our hedging activities seek to offset the impact  both positive and negative  that foreign exchange rate changes may have on our net income 
as such  the impact to our net results of operations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates has been largely mitigated 
for the years ended december  and  operating income was as follows amounts in millions change operating income operating income as a percentage of product sales was for and for the decline in operating income as a percentage of product sales for the year ended compared to the year ended primarily reflects the impact of the acquired ipr d charges related to the abgenix and avidia acquisitions in  the increase in r d expenses to expand our r d activities as discussed below  higher selling  general and administrative sg a expenses to support our growing organization and the expensing of stock options  which commenced january  we focus our r d on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of grievous illness 
see item business research and development and selected product candidates for further information on our r d vision and product pipeline 
we have substantially expanded our r d capabilities and plan to continue increasing our investments to expand these capabilities to manage and execute increasingly larger and more complex clinical trials and to build the capacity to advance more compounds into and through the clinic 
we began nine mega site trials involving or more sites in to support denosumab and our other late stage programs 
for  we expect r d expense to increase  although not to the extent experienced in  due to the continuance of the mega site trials previously started  including the nine started in  beginning additional studies in in support of our late stage programs  including studies for panitumumab and motesanib diphosphate  and advancing a number of additional molecules into phase the nine mega site trials  which we began in  will continue to require significant time  resources and expense to execute 
see item a 
risk factors before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates  we must conduct clinical trials in humans  if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected 
to execute our clinical trial programs  we need to continue the growth of our development organization and associated r d support organizations  implement new management structures and approaches and continue to partner with third party contract clinical trial providers 
further  to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials  we partnered with third party contract clinical trial providers to open clinical sites and are enrolling patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited  including russia  mexico and some south american countries 
in  we plan to expand into southeast asia and india 
on april   we paid shareholders of abgenix in cash per common share for a total value of approximately billion to acquire all of the outstanding shares and assumed abgenix s outstanding debt with a fair value of approximately million 
abgenix was a company with expertise in the discovery and development of monoclonal antibodies and was our co development partner for vectibix 
the results of abgenix s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements commencing april  on october   we completed our acquisition of avidia 
pursuant to the merger agreement  we paid in cash approximately million  net of cash acquired and our existing equity stake in avidia  and may be subject to pay additional amounts upon the achievement of certain future events 
avidia focused on the discovery and development of a new class of human therapeutic known as avimer proteins 
the transaction provides amgen with avidia s lead product candidate  an inhibitor of interleukin il for the treatment of inflammation and autoimmune diseases  which is in phase clinical trials 
the results of avidia s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements commencing october  in december  we entered into a collaboration agreement with cytokinetics incorporated cytokinetics to discover  develop and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics that activate cardiac 
table of contents muscle contractility for potential application in the treatment of heart failure 
in addition  we obtained an option to participate in future developments and commercialization of cytokinetics lead drug candidate arising from this program  ck  which recently entered two phase clinical trials 
the collaboration is worldwide  excluding japan 
there are many economic and industry wide factors that affect our business generally and uniquely  including  among others  those relating to increased complexity and cost of r d due  in part  to greater scrutiny of clinical trials with respect to safety which may lead to fewer treatments being approved by the fda  increasingly intense competition for marketed products and product candidates  broad reimbursement changes  complex and expanding regulatory requirements  and intellectual property protection 
see item business and item a 
risk factors for further information on these economic and industry wide factors and their impact and potential impact on our business 
in addition to these economic and industry wide factors  we  as a company  face certain additional challenges and have a number of opportunities as well 
our principal products have established leadership positions attaining significant sales levels over the last few years and have experienced strong year over year sales growth 
however  the rate of growth has declined in each of the past several years and  in the near term  we expect this trend to continue 
we believe that future sales growth for certain of our principal products should benefit from segment growth  including increased penetration through new areas of treatment and or greater awareness 
at the same time in  however  they will be subject to increasing competition  which includes the expected introduction of biosimilars in europe 
in addition  future sales growth may be impacted by healthcare provider prescribing behavior or use of our products  or regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement of our products 
also  with the promise of our growing pipeline comes the challenge of delivering on the pipeline  including executing on large and complex clinical trials 
to execute on these clinical trial programs we will need to increase the growth of our r d organization  open clinical sites and enroll patients in new geographic locations and continue reliance on third party contractors 
further  the growth of our clinical and commercial operations will require increased manufacturing capacity  which is a lengthy and costly process 
in the near term  our objectives to assist in meeting these challenges and to be successful in taking advantage of our opportunities are to i balance short term financial performance with increased r d investment to allow us to execute key clinical trials for our late stage product candidates and advance a number of additional molecules further along the development process  ii grow our markets and hold or increase share  iii vigorously defend our intellectual property and increase our leadership in anemia management  and iv proactively expand production capacity as we grow 
results of operations product sales for the years ended december   and  worldwide product sales and total product sales by geographic region were as follows amounts in millions change change aranesp neulasta neupogen epogen enbrel sensipar vectibix n a n a other total product sales total us total international total product sales 
table of contents product sales are influenced by a number of factors  including demand  third party reimbursement availability and policies  regulatory developments  clinical trial outcomes  clinical practice  pricing strategies  wholesaler and end user inventory management practices  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  new product launches and indications  competitive products  product supply and acquisitions 
see item business principal products for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications 
sales growth in and was principally driven by demand for aranesp  neulasta and enbrel  which benefited from share gains and or market growth 
international product sales growth in benefited by million from foreign currency exchange rate changes 
we expect aranesp  neulasta and enbrel to continue to drive year over year sales growth in and that vectibix will also contribute to that growth 
however  we expect that maintaining or increasing share will be more of a challenge than in previous years as we experienced share loss with enbrel in compared to and we operate in an increasingly competitive environment 
going forward  we will focus on growing our segments  including increasing our penetration in the therapeutic areas in which our products are used  while also continuing to focus on maintaining or increasing share 
we believe that our product sales for and were not significantly impacted by the reimbursement changes resulting from the mma implemented in we believe this was  in part  due to the effects of cms and oncology demonstration projects on sales of our products used in supportive cancer care  especially aranesp 
however  we believe it is unlikely that cms will implement an oncology demonstration project for furthermore  we believe that our sales for and were not significantly impacted  in part  due to increased reimbursement rates to physicians from cms for services associated with drug administration 
the medicare physician fee schedule payment final rule reduced payments for physician services in by approximately on average  although subsequent legislation eliminated this reduction for the medicare physician fee schedule payment final rule for would have reduced payments for physician services in by approximately on average  however  as in  new legislation eliminated the reduction in payments for because we cannot accurately predict the impact of any such changes on how  or under what circumstances  healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our products  we cannot estimate the full impact of the mma on our business  although we believe that it is not likely to be significant to our business in however  additional provisions of the mma and other regulations affecting reimbursement that have gone or may go into effect could affect our product sales and related sales growth in the future

the growth in us aranesp sales also reflects increased aranesp usage in us hospital dialysis clinics from continued conversion from epogen  which we believe stabilized in mid the increase in international aranesp sales for the year ended december  was also principally driven by demand 
the increase in us aranesp sales for the year ended december  was primarily driven by market growth and share gains

table of contents aranesp usage in us hospital dialysis clinics increased  reflecting a conversion from epogen 
international aranesp sales growth for was principally driven by demand  benefiting only slightly  million  from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for  we believe that aranesp sales growth will be driven primarily by segment growth 
further  sales of aranesp have benefited  and may continue to benefit  by its use in us hospital dialysis clinics to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure instead of epogen  however  we believe this conversion stabilized as of mid in addition  we believe future worldwide aranesp sales growth may also be dependent  in part  on such factors as reimbursement by third party payers including governments and private insurance plans  cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on healthcare providers  governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products  government programs  adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others which may expand safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior  use of our product  regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices  penetration of existing and new segments  including potential new indications  patient population growth  the effects of pricing strategies  an increasingly competitive environment of products or therapies  which in in the united states could potentially include competition in the nephrology segment from roche s peg epo  which roche has indicated they intend to bring to the us market in despite our ongoing lawsuit and their acknowledgement of our us erythropoietin patents see item legal proceedings roche matters amgen inc v

in addition  the increase in demand for neulasta for the year ended december  also includes the impact of a percent us price increase in april us demand for neulasta continued to benefit from a product label extension based on clinical data demonstrating the value of first cycle utilization in moderate high risk chemotherapy regimens 
the increase in international neulasta neupogen sales for the year ended december  was driven primarily by demand for neulasta 
the increase in us neulasta neupogen sales for the year ended december  was driven primarily by demand for neulasta  which benefited from guidelines recommending earlier use 
us neulasta neupogen sales  neulasta in particular  also benefited from a label extension based on clinical data demonstrating the value of first cycle use in moderate risk chemotherapy regimens 
in addition  us sales growth was

although asps for us neulasta trended downward during  they began to stabilize during the fourth quarter of the increase in international neulasta neupogen sales for the year ended december   was driven primarily by demand for neulasta 
international neulasta neupogen sales for also benefited by million from foreign currency exchange rate changes 
we believe that sales growth for neulasta neupogen will depend on further segment penetration of neulasta in the moderate risk population that would benefit from its earlier use and by focusing on the value of its treatment in first and subsequent chemotherapy cycles 
in addition  future worldwide neulasta neupogen sales growth will be dependent  in part  on such factors as reimbursement by third party payers including governments and private insurance plans  cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on healthcare providers  adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others which may expand safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior  use of our product  regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices  governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products  government programs see item a

future chemotherapy treatments that are less myelosuppressive may require less neulasta neupogen  however  other future chemotherapy treatments that are more myelosuppressive  such as dose dense chemotherapy  could require more neulasta neupogen 
neupogen competes with neulasta in the united states and europe 
us and international neupogen sales have been adversely impacted by conversion to neulasta 
however  we believe that most of the conversion in the united states and in europe has occurred 
epogen for the years ended december   and  total epogen sales were as follows amounts in millions change change epogen us reported epogen sales for the year ended december  increased modestly primarily due to the increased demand in the free standing dialysis centers partially offset by the increased use of aranesp in the hospital setting 
we believe that conversion to aranesp in the hospital setting stabilized in mid we believe demand for epogen in the free standing dialysis centers  which account for the majority of the epogen sales  remained consistent with patient population growth at approximately to percent 
epogen sales for the year ended december  decreased primarily due to lower demand  unfavorable changes in wholesaler inventory levels and an unfavorable revised estimate of dialysis demand  primarily spillover  for prior quarters 
demand for was affected by conversion to aranesp in the us hospital dialysis clinics  which represented approximately of the epogen business  and reflected higher sales incentives 
demand for epogen in the free standing dialysis clinics remained consistent with patient population growth at approximately to percent 
spillover is a result of our contractual relationship with johnson johnson see summary of critical accounting policies epogen revenue recognition below and note  summary of significant accounting policies product sales to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior  use of our product  regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices 
sales for epogen in could  however  be favorably impacted to a certain degree by underlying demand in the free standing dialysis centers  which we believe will remain consistent with the annual patient population growth of to percent  and the lessened impact of conversion to aranesp in the us hospital dialysis clinics  which we believe stabilized in mid dialysis patients receiving treatment for anemia associated with end stage renal disease with epogen are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government 
therefore  going forward  we believe epogen sales growth will further depend on changes in reimbursement rates or a change in the basis for reimbursement by the federal government 
we believe epogen sales growth will also be dependent  in part  on future governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products  cost containment pressures from the federal government on healthcare providers and the effects of pricing strategies see item a

enbrel sales growth benefited from its competitive profile and significant growth of biologics in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments 
sales growth for enbrel in will depend on growing both the rheumatology and dermatology segments

income taxes our effective tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for increased primarily due to the write off of acquired ipr d costs in connection with the acquisitions of abgenix and avidia  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
the increase in the rate was partially offset by an increase in the amount of foreign earnings intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the united states and favorable audit settlements 
in addition  the tax rate was negatively impacted by the tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings in under the american jobs creation act of as permitted in accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for income taxes special areas  we do not provide for us income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united states 

table of contents the effective tax rate was lower than the effective tax rate due to the favorable resolution of prior year foreign tax credit claims and r d tax credits with the internal revenue service irs  and the absence of the write off of non deductible ipr d costs in connection with the acquisition of tularik in this decrease was partially offset by the tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings in under the american jobs creation act 
in the fourth quarter of  we repatriated million of foreign earnings  which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced tax rate 
the tax expense incurred on the repatriation was approximately million

recent accounting pronouncements on january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires us to account for our stock options using a fair value based method as described in such statement and recognize the resulting compensation expense in our financial statements 
prior to january   we accounted for our employee stock options using the intrinsic value method under apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which generally did not result in any employee stock option expense 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation expense recognized subsequent to adoption includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the values estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair values estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
the modified prospective transition method did not require recognition of related compensation expense in our financial statements for prior periods 
comparability  therefore  of the current period financial statements to prior periods has been and will be impacted 
the adoption of sfas no 
r had a material impact on our results of operations for the annual stock option expense is dependent on a number of factors including the number of stock options granted  our common stock price and related expected volatility and other inputs utilized in estimating the fair value of the stock options at the time of grant 
as a result of recognizing compensation expense for stock options pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
r  our income before income taxes for the year ended december   was million lower  and our net income was million lower than if we had continued to account for stock options under apb no 
in addition  both basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  were lower  than if we had continued to account for stock options under apb no 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing rules for recognition  measurement  classification and disclosure in our financial statements of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
based on our evaluations  we currently believe that the only impact to us of adopting this new standard is to reclassify certain liabilities for uncertain tax positions from current to non current liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
we adopted this new standard effective january  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes selected financial data amounts in millions december  cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities total assets current debt non current debt stockholders equity 
table of contents we believe that existing funds  cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future  as well as to support our stock repurchase programs and other business initiatives  including acquisitions and licensing activities 
however  in order to provide for greater financial flexibility and liquidity  we are currently reviewing additional borrowing opportunities 
we would expect to use any proceeds raised by such borrowing primarily for purchases of shares under our stock repurchase program and for general corporate purposes  including satisfying our obligation to repay borrowings under our modified convertible notes if the note holders elect to put the notes to us for payment on march   capital expenditures and other working capital needs 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of the total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december   approximately billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use outside the united states 
if these funds are repatriated for use in our us operations  substantial additional taxes on certain of these amounts would be required to be paid 
in the fourth quarter of  we repatriated million of foreign earnings  which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced tax rate under the american jobs act 
the repatriation of these funds resulted in an increase in our tax provision of million 
the primary objectives for our investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are made with the objective of achieving the highest rate of return  consistent with these two objectives 
our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer 
financing arrangements in february  we issued billion principal amount of convertible notes due in the convertible notes and billion principal amount of convertible notes due in the convertible notes in a private placement 
the convertible notes and the convertible notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of and  respectively 
the convertible notes and the convertible notes may be convertible based on an initial conversion rate of shares and shares  respectively  per  principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of approximately and per share  respectively 
the convertible notes and the convertible notes may only be converted during any calendar quarter beginning after june  if the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the respective conversion price per share during a defined period at the end of the previous quarter  if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or specified corporate transactions occur or one month prior to the respective maturity date 
upon conversion  a holder would receive cash equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the note or the conversion value  as defined  and to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the note  shares of our common stock  cash or a combination of common stock and cash  at our option the excess conversion value 
in addition  upon a change in control  as defined  the holders may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes for of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
moody s and standard poor s rate our outstanding convertible notes a and a  respectively 
in connection with the issuance of these convertible notes  a total of billion of our common stock was repurchased under our stock repurchase program 
also concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes and the convertible notes  we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions 
the convertible note hedges allow us to receive shares of our common stock and or cash from the counterparties to the transactions equal to the amounts of common stock and or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to the holders of the convertible notes and the convertible notes upon conversion 
these transactions will terminate the earlier of the maturity dates of the related notes or the first day none of the related notes remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise 
the cost of the convertible note hedges  which aggregated approximately billion  was recorded as a reduction of equity 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the and convertible notes  the repurchase of common stock and the purchase of the convertible note hedges was million 

table of contents also concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes and the convertible notes  we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share in a private placement 
pursuant to these transactions  warrants for approximately million shares of our common stock may be settled in may and warrants for approximately million shares of our common stock may be settled in may the settlement dates 
if the average price of our common stock during a defined period ending on or about the respective settlement dates exceeds the exercise price of the warrants  the warrants will be settled  at our option  in cash or shares of our common stock 
proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately million 
as of december  we had zero coupon convertible notes due in with an accreted value of billion outstanding and having an aggregate face amount of billion and yield to maturity of 
the holders of these convertible notes may require us to purchase  for cash  all or a portion of their convertible notes on specified dates the put option  at a price equal to the original issuance price plus the accrued original issue discount through the purchase date 
the next available put option date is on march  accordingly  the convertible notes were classified as current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  moody s and standard poor s rate our outstanding convertible notes a and a  respectively

our outstanding long term debt is rated a by moody s and a by standard poor s 
under the million shelf  all of the remaining million of debt securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time under our medium term note program with terms to be determined at the time of issuance 
we have a billion unsecured revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes  including commercial paper support  which matures in november additionally  we have a commercial paper program  which provides for unsecured  short term borrowings of up to an aggregate of billion 
no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility or commercial paper program as of december  we have a billion shelf registration statement the billion shelf which allows us to issue debt securities  common stock and associated preferred share purchase rights  preferred stock  warrants to purchase debt securities  common stock or preferred stock  securities purchase contracts  securities purchase units and depositary shares 
the billion shelf was established to provide for further financial flexibility and the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance 
as of december   no securities had been issued under the billion shelf 
to protect against the potential increase in the fair value of our non convertible  fixed interest rate notes due to a decline in interest rates  we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert the payment of our fixed rate notes to libor based variable interest payments over the life of the respective notes 
these interest rate swap agreements qualify and are designated as fair value hedges 
as of december  and  billion and billion  respectively  aggregate face amount of our outstanding non convertible  fixed interest rate debt was covered by these interest rate swap agreements 
certain of our financing arrangements contain non financial covenants and as of december   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants

investing on october   we completed our acquisition of avidia and paid million in cash  net of cash acquired and our existing equity stake in avidia 
in addition  we may be subject to pay additional amounts upon the achievement of certain future events 
on april    we completed our acquisition of abgenix and paid billion in cash to the shareholders of abgenix to acquire all outstanding shares 
in addition  we acquired million in cash  and subsequent to the completion of the acquisition  we paid off million of debt assumed in this transaction 
capital expenditures totaled billion in compared with million in and billion in capital expenditures in were primarily associated with ongoing manufacturing capacity and site expansions in ireland  puerto rico and other locations and costs associated with implementing our erp system 
capital expenditures in primarily related to the puerto rico manufacturing expansion which included a new manufacturing plant for the commercial production of neulasta and neupogen approved by the fda in september  thousand oaks site expansion  colorado manufacturing expansion and site development to support the new enbrel manufacturing plant in rhode island  also approved by the fda in september capital expenditures in primarily related to the thousand oaks site expansion  the new enbrel manufacturing plant in rhode island and the puerto rico manufacturing expansion 
we currently estimate spending on capital projects and equipment to be in the range of to billion as we continue to increase our manufacturing and r d operations globally and proceed with the implementation of our erp system 
the most significant of these expenditures are expected to be incurred with the further expansion of the puerto rico bulk manufacturing  formulation  fill and finish facilities  the start of construction of a new bulk manufacturing  formulation  fill and finish facility and other site infrastructure support in ireland and the expansion of r d operations in the united states 
for additional information on our planned capital projects  see item business manufacturing and raw materials 
financing in december  the board authorized us to repurchase up to an additional billion of common stock 
as of december   we had billion available for stock repurchases under this and the previously authorized stock repurchase programs 
the manner of purchases  the amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a variety of factors  including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares  and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions 

table of contents repurchases under our stock repurchase program reflect  in part  our confidence in the long term value of amgen common stock

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
accordingly  the table below excludes contractual obligations relating to milestone and royalty payments due to third parties  all of which are contingent upon certain future events 
such events could include  but are not limited to  development 
table of contents milestones  regulatory approvals and product sales 
additionally  the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon terms or amounts for some obligations 
the following chart represents our contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type amounts in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations the long term obligation amounts in the above table differ from the related carrying amounts on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  due to the accretion of the original issue discount on the convertible notes and modified convertible notes and the inclusion of future interest payments 
future interest payments are included on the notes  the notes  the convertible notes  the convertible notes  the notes and the century notes at fixed rates of     and  respectively  through maturity in     and  respectively 
holders of the modified convertible notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates the next of which is march  at the original issuance price plus accrued original issue discount accreted value through the purchase dates 
consequently  the amounts above reflect the modified convertible notes accreted value on march   the next put date 
see note  financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible notes 
purchase obligations primarily relate to our long term supply agreement with bi pharma for the manufacture of commercial quantities of enbrel  which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity for enbrel and reflect certain estimates such as production run success rates and bulk drug yields achieved  r d commitments including those related to clinical trials for new and existing products  capital expenditures for further expansion of the puerto rico bulk manufacturing  formulation  fill and finish facilities  the start of construction of a new bulk manufacturing  formulation  fill and finish facility and other site infrastructure support in ireland  the expansion of r d operations in the united states  and open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business 
our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events 
summary of critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and therefore  actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents product sales  sales incentives and returns sales of our products are recognized when shipped and title and risk of loss have passed 
product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates  wholesaler chargebacks  discounts and other incentives collectively sales incentives and returns 
for additional discussion regarding revenue recognition  see epogen revenue recognition below 
in the united states  we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as clinics  hospitals and pharmacies 
products we sell outside the united states are principally distributed to hospitals and or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product has been launched 
we monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesale distributors using third party data and we believe that wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels generally two to three weeks given end user demand 
accordingly  historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales incentives and returns 
accruals for sales incentives are recorded in the same period that the related sales are recorded and are recognized as a reduction in product sales 
sales incentive accruals are based on reasonable estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
these estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends  internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns 
sales incentives are product specific and  therefore  for any given year  can be impacted by the mix of products sold 
for the years ended december   and  reductions in product sales relating to sales incentives are comprised of the following amounts in millions rebates wholesaler chargebacks discounts and other incentives total sales incentives percent of gross product sales rebates earned by healthcare providers such as clinics  hospitals and pharmacies in the united states are the sales incentives that are most difficult to estimate 
these rebates are performance based offers that are primarily based on attaining contractually specified sales volumes and growth 
as a result  the calculation of the accrual for these rebates is complicated by the need to estimate customer buying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate s to be earned over a contractual period 
these rebates totaled  million in   million in and  million in we believe that the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances 
however  actual results may differ 
based on our recent experience  changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods have been less than of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for such periods 
these changes in annual estimates substantially relate to sales made in the immediately preceding annual period 
a change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in would have had an impact of approximately million on our product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity 
wholesaler chargebacks are another type of arrangement included in sales incentives that relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the united states at fixed prices that are lower than the list prices we charge wholesalers 
when the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices  the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices they pay us and the prices they sold the products to the healthcare providers 
these chargebacks from wholesalers totaled  million in   million in and  million in accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we settle these deductions generally within a few weeks of incurring the liability 

table of contents amounts accrued for sales incentives are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate 
accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results 
however  such adjustments to date have not been material to our results of operations or financial position 
the following table summarizes amounts recorded in accrued liabilities regarding sales incentives amounts in millions balance at beginning of period amounts charged against product sales payments balance at end of period year ended december  december  includes immaterial amounts related to prior year product sales based on changes in estimates 
such amounts represented approximately of incentive amounts charged against product sales for both and accruals for estimated sales returns are recorded in the same period that the related product sales are recorded and are recognized as reductions in product sales 
returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis 
historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product when appropriate 
historically  sales returns have been insignificant  amounting to approximately of gross product sales 
epogen revenue recognition we have the exclusive right to sell epoetin alfa for dialysis  certain diagnostics and all non human  non research uses in the united states 
we sell epoetin alfa under the brand name epogen 
we granted to johnson johnson a license relating to epoetin alfa for sales in the united states for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics 
this license agreement  which is perpetual  may be terminated for various reasons  including upon mutual agreement of the parties or default 
the parties are required to compensate each other for epoetin alfa sales that either party makes into the other party s exclusive market  sometimes referred to as spillover 
accordingly  we do not recognize product sales we make into the exclusive market of johnson johnson and do recognize the product sales made by johnson johnson into our exclusive market 
the amount of epogen product sales we recognize each period consists of i the amount of epogen we ship to our customers who are wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products and ii adjustments for spillover  as described below 
sales to our customers are evidenced by binding written agreements and purchase orders  and accordingly  the amounts are fixed and determinable 
the calculated spillover amount has no impact on the amounts owed to us by our customers 
we are employing an arbitrated audit methodology to measure each party s spillover based on independent third party data on shipments to end users and their estimated usage 
data on end user usage is derived in part using market sampling techniques  and accordingly  the results of such sampling can produce variability in the amount of recognized spillover 
we initially recognize spillover based on estimates of shipments to end users and their usage  utilizing historical third party data and subsequently adjust such amounts based on revised third party data as received 
differences between initial estimates of spillover and amounts based on revised third party data could produce materially different amounts for recognized epogen sales 
however  such differences to date have not been material 
deferred income taxes our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united states based on our projected cash flow  working capital and long term investment requirements of our us and foreign operations 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the united states  an additional tax provision and related liability would be required which could materially impact our future effective tax rate 

table of contents the american jobs creation act was enacted on october  one provision of the american jobs creation act effectively reduced the tax rate on a qualifying repatriation of earnings by providing for an dividend received deduction 
in the fourth quarter of  we repatriated million under the american jobs creation act  which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced rate 
the tax expense incurred on this repatriation was approximately million 
we intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were not repatriated under the american jobs creation act 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes  contractual disputes  tax claims and governmental investigations 
certain of these proceedings are discussed in item legal proceedings 
we record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable 
we consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies 
our income tax returns are routinely audited by the irs and various state and foreign tax authorities 
significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations 
we periodically evaluate our exposures associated with tax filing positions 
while we believe our positions comply with applicable laws  we record liabilities based upon estimates of the ultimate outcomes of these matters 
while it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these items  we do not believe any such items currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity  although an adverse resolution in any quarterly or annual reporting period of one or more of these items could have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations for that period 
valuation of acquired intangible assets we have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets primarily via the acquisition of biotechnology companies 
these intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in process product candidates as well as goodwill arising in business combinations 
when significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired  an independent third party valuation firm is engaged to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations  and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk that may result from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments 
to reduce certain of these risks  we enter into various types of derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program 
we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 

table of contents interest rate sensitive financial instruments our investment portfolio of available for sale debt securities  comprised primarily of corporate debt instruments and treasury securities  had a fair value of billion and billion at december  and the fair values of these securities and the income they generate is impacted by fluctuations in us interest rates 
a hypothetical change in interest rates of relative to interest rates at december  and would not have a material effect on the fair values of these securities or our cash flows or income 
on december   we had outstanding debt with a fair value of billion including debt with a fair value billion  which may be converted into our common stock in certain circumstances 
on december   we had outstanding debt with a fair value of billion including debt with a fair value of billion  which may be converted into our common stock 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on our outstanding debt because they bear interest at fixed rates 
however  changes in interest rates would affect their fair values 
to protect against possible increases in the fair value of our non convertible debt  we entered into interest rate swap agreements  which qualify and are designated as fair value hedges 
these agreements swapped the receipt of fixed interest payments for libor based variable interest payments over the lives of the respective notes 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at december  and would not have a material impact on the fair values of our outstanding debt and would not have a material impact on the fair values  cash flows or income with respect to the interest rate swap agreements 
market price sensitive instruments as noted above  a portion of our outstanding debt may be converted into our common stock 
accordingly  the price of our common stock may affect the fair value of our convertible debt 
a hypothetical decrease in the price of amgen stock from the price at december  and would have reduced the fair value of our then outstanding convertible debt by approximately million and million  respectively 
on december  and  we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments  which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector 
also  on december   we had equity forward contracts to hedge against changes in the fair market value of a portion of our equity investment portfolio 
price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio and equity forward contracts on december  and was not material 
foreign currency sensitive instruments our results of operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies  predominately the euro  as a result of the sales of our products in foreign markets 
both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign exchange rates are partially mitigated by the natural  opposite impact that foreign exchange rates have on our international operating expenses 
to further reduce our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in our results of operations  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts 
on december   we had outstanding forward exchange and options contracts with notional amounts of  million and million  respectively  that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions 
these contracts had net unrealized losses totaling million on december  also on december   we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling million that hedge fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
these contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of december  with regard to these contracts  a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates on december  would result in a reduction in fair value  cash flows and income of million and million on contracts that have and have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes  respectively 
on december   we had outstanding forward exchange and options contracts with notional amounts of  million and million  respectively  that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges 
table of contents of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions 
these contracts had net unrealized gains totaling million on december  also  on december   we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling million that hedge fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes

the analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions and assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset
