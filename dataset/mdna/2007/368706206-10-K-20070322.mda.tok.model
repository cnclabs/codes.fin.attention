genelabs technologies  inc  referred to as genelabs or the company  is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of pharmaceutical products to improve human health 
the company has built drug discovery capabilities that can support various research and development projects 
the company is currently concentrating these capabilities on discovering novel compounds that selectively inhibit replication of the hepatitis c virus  or hcv  and advancing preclinical development of compounds from this hepatitis c virus drug discovery program  while also exploring options for development of a late stage product for lupus 
a number of events have impacted the business and results of genelabs during on june   we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with the novartis institutes for biomedical research novartis for the development and commercialization of compounds from genelabs hcv non nucleoside drug discovery program 
we received a nonrefundable up front payment of million upon 
table of contents signing of the agreement and are also entitled to additional minimum research funding totaling approximately million over the initial two year research term for work performed on the collaboration 
in addition  if all potential clinical  regulatory and sales milestones are met  we could receive additional payments in excess of million 
we are also entitled to a royalty on net sales of products covered by the collaboration 
the million up front payment has been recorded as unearned contract revenue  classified as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet  and we plan to record it into contract revenue on a straight line basis over a three year period 
the three year period consists of the initial two year term of the research collaboration plus a one year term that novartis has as an option to extend the collaboration 
in  genelabs recognized into revenue million from the up front license fee and from ongoing research funding 
at december   unearned contract revenue received from novartis was comprised solely of the unamortized portion of the initial up front payment 
in drug discovery  we continued to expand our research capacity and capability by hiring additional scientists 
we have continued to work with gilead sciences  our licensee and collaborator  on the discovery and characterization of novel nucleoside hcv inhibitors 
we also continue our efforts to discover and characterize novel non nucleoside hcv polymerase inhibitors 
we conducted this work on our own until june  at which time we began working in collaboration with novartis 
separately  we expanded our efforts to discover novel hcv inhibitors that function through interaction with a protein encoded by the nsa region of the hcv genome 
in drug development  we focused on defining possible paths forward for our investigational drug for women with lupus  prestara tm 
patients who completed our phase iii clinical trial  designated study gl  were eligible to enroll in a month open label continuation study which was designated study gl this follow on trial assessed the effect of prestara on bone mineral density of the study gl participants over an additional months 
preliminary results of study gl indicated that patients who received mg of prestara per day increased their bone mineral density  or bmd  at the lumbar spine by approximately during the months they were enrolled in study gl results of study gl also indicated that patients who received a lower dose of prestara  mg per day  did not increase their bmd during the clinical trial  and in fact lost a measurable amount of bmd at the lumbar spine over the month period of study gl the safety profile for prestara in this study was consistent with that seen in previous clinical studies 
after learning these results  we had a meeting with the fda for the purpose of determining the future development path for prestara 
in the meeting the fda informed us that we would need additional positive clinical trial data before they would consider reviewing a new drug application for prestara  and they indicated that one additional  positive clinical trial could suffice for an indication of treating the signs and symptoms of lupus disease activity 
going forward  we intend to pursue an indication for treating the signs and symptoms of lupus disease activity rather than the bone density indication we had pursued since in this regard  in december  we submitted a protocol to the fda for a new phase iii clinical trial with prestara that would use time to first severe flare as a primary endpoint 
the protocol was submitted to the fda together with a request for special protocol assessment spa which directs the agency to meet with sponsors for the purpose of reaching a binding agreement on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in an nda 
under spa procedures  taken together with the totality of data within the nda  if our study meets the outcomes agreed upon in advance with the fda it would  in principle  meet fda s standards for nda approval  provided the fda assessment of the risk benefit ratio for prestara is positive 
genelabs does not currently plan to initiate the trial unless satisfactory financing has been committed to do so 
on june   we completed the sale of million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of million 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share and a term of five years 
net proceeds from the placement were approximately million 
subsequent to december   on february   genelabs completed the sale of approximately  shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase approximately  shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of million 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share and a term of five years 
net proceeds from the placement were approximately million 
on april   we received a notice from the nasdaq stock market  or nasdaq  stating that we did not meet the nasdaq capital market continued listing requirements  which require a minimum of million in shareholders equity or a market capitalization of million  among other things 
we responded to nasdaq with our plan 
table of contents to regain compliance with their requirements  but on may  nasdaq sent us a letter stating that our securities would be delisted 
we filed an appeal of nasdaq s determination to delist our securities and subsequently attended an oral hearing before a nasdaq listings qualification panel  or the panel 
at the oral hearing we provided the panel with financial information showing our compliance with the nasdaq capital market continued listing requirement for shareholders equity as of june  on august  we announced that we received notification from nasdaq that the panel granted our request for continued listing on the nasdaq capital market 
the notification further stated that under nasdaq marketplace rule d  the panel will continue to monitor our compliance with the continued listing standards of the nasdaq capital market for a period of one year 
during this one year period  which expires august   if the company fails to comply with the continued listing standards an additional hearing regarding the listing would be promptly scheduled pursuant to marketplace rule a 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the following are critical accounting estimates which are important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations as presented in the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees where we continue involvement through a collaboration or other obligation is referred to as unearned contract revenue and classified as a liability on the balance sheet 
we amortize unearned contract revenue into contract revenue on the statement of operations over the research or development period instead of recognizing it into income immediately upon receipt 
we base the amortization period for each agreement on our estimate of the period we have significant obligations under the contract 
we continually review the basis for our estimates  and we may change the estimates if circumstances change 
these changes can significantly increase or decrease the amount of revenue recognized in the financial statements 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate the revenue among the deliverables based on objective and reliable evidence of each deliverable s fair value 
unearned contract revenue at december  was from four different sources 
genelabs management considers the amortization periods for each of the up front payments as critical accounting estimates 
at december   the largest component of unearned contract revenue is related to an up front payment from the novartis institutes for biomedical research novartis under a research collaboration and license agreement we entered into in when the agreement was signed we received an up front payment of million that we are recognizing over a three year period from the effective date of the collaboration 
the three year period is based on the initial two year term of our research obligations to novartis plus an additional one year extension  which is at novartis sole option 
as of december   million of unearned contract revenue was related to the up front payment received from novartis  of which million was classified as current 
in addition to the up front payment  novartis is also obligated to pay us on going research funding 
at december   genelabs has unearned contract revenue related to an up front payment from gilead sciences  inc under a research collaboration and license agreement we entered into in when the agreement was signed we received an up front payment of million that we are amortizing over a four year period from the effective date of the collaboration 
the four year period is based on the initial three year term of our research obligations to gilead plus an additional one year extension  which is at gilead s sole option 
as of december   million of unearned contract revenue was related to the up front payment received from gilead  of which million was classified as current 
in addition to the up front payment  gilead is also obligated to pay us on going research funding 
before december   gilead paid us million for research to be performed in the first quarter of  which we have classified as deferred revenue  all of which is current 
at december   genelabs has unearned contract revenue related to two separate agreements for prestara  genelabs investigational drug for lupus 
we amortize the two up front payments we received over the estimated development terms for prestara for the territories covered by each of the agreements 
genelabs management believes that its significant obligations under the agreements extend to the time when regulatory 
table of contents decisions are made to approve prestara in the key licensed territory  if prestara were to be approved  or until further development of prestara is terminated 
we licensed exclusive rights to prestara for north america to watson pharmaceuticals  inc watson 
as of december  we have unearned contract revenue of million from the up front payment we received in in conjunction with the agreement  of which million was classified as current 
in a change from the prior year as discussed further below  we are amortizing the unearned contract revenue through december  we licensed exclusive rights to prestara for japan to tanabe seiyaku co  ltd tanabe 
as of december  we have unearned contract revenue of million from the up front payment we received in in conjunction with the agreement  of which million was classified as current 
in a change from the prior year as discussed further below  we are amortizing the unearned contract revenue through december  in all of the agreements for which we have recorded deferred revenue  the estimated period for amortization has an important impact on the revenue we recognize  and  in turn  on the net loss we report in our financial statements 
for example  if longer terms were estimated our revenue would be lower and our net loss would be higher 
conversely  if a shorter amortization term were estimated  our revenue would be greater and the net loss lower 
we regularly assess the remaining terms over which the up front payments are being recognized into the statement of operations and  if appropriate  make changes based on updated information 
for example  in the fourth quarter of we lengthened the amortization period for the unearned contract revenue related to our agreements with watson and tanabe for prestara 
the amortization period for the unearned revenue related to the watson agreement was extended from december  to december  the new estimate is based upon our recent discussions with the fda about the specifications for another clinical trial which will be required as part of the nda approval process for prestara in the united states and our expectations regarding the length of time it will take to secure a partner to fund the trial 
the amortization period for the unearned revenue related to the tanabe agreement was extended from december  to december  this estimate is based upon our expectations regarding the timeline for nda approval in japan 
we anticipate that tanabe will supplement regulatory filing in japan with data from the potential additional trial in the united states 
as a result  we currently anticipate that approval in japan will take place approximately three years after approval in the united states 
we believe we are using the most appropriate terms based on the facts known to us as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k 
however  further actions taken by the fda  decisions made by our collaborators or other changes in circumstances after the filing of this annual report on form k may either reduce or lengthen the remaining period over which genelabs records unearned contract revenue into the statement of operations 
additionally  in the event that we and or our collaborators elect to terminate a research program  we may be required to record all of the remaining related unrecognized revenue at the time of cancellation  however  this revenue may be offset in whole or part by any costs required to terminate the collaboration or research program 
accounting for employee stock options 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas r  superseding previous accounting rules covering stock options issued to employees 
we adopted sfas r effective january  using the modified prospective transition method 
under sfas r  we record compensation expense for stock options issued to employees in our consolidated statement of operations based on an estimate of the fair value of the options when they are issued 
under the modified prospective application  prior periods are not restated to reflect the impact of sfas r for comparative purposes 
the total share based compensation expense recognized for the year ended december  was million 
prior to  as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  referred to as sfas  we applied the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock option plans 
accordingly  we accounted for employee stock options based on their intrinsic value and did not recognize compensation expense for employee options granted at fair market value or higher 
in the notes to our financial statements we separately disclose the pro forma effects on reported net loss and loss per share for and as if compensation expense had been recognized based on the fair value method of accounting using the black scholes option pricing model 

table of contents to value our options under the provisions of both sfas and sfas r  we made assumptions about risk free interest rates  dividend yields  volatility and weighted average expected lives of the options 
genelabs management believes that these estimates are subjective  and notes that changes in any of these assumptions  particularly the volatility assumption  would increase or decrease the accounting value of the option and correspondingly increase or decrease the net loss and loss per share as reported in our consolidated statement of operations in or the pro forma disclosures for and results of operations years ended december  and summary 
genelabs net loss was million for  compared to a net loss of million for the lower net loss in compared is primarily due to higher revenue as a result of the collaboration with novartis  and lower expenses for the development of prestara tm  our investigational new drug for lupus  including a reversal of certain costs previously accrued under to the program partially offsetting the above decreases in our net loss were increased drug discovery expenses for our hcv drug discovery programs  including preclinical development and scaled up synthesis costs for the non nucleoside program prior to the licensing agreement with novartis  increased general and administrative expenses for financial advisory and other fees related to the collaboration with novartis  increased expenses for our employee incentive bonus compensation program after we met board specified criteria resulting in the removal of payment contingencies earlier this year  and increased expenses upon the adoption of a new accounting standard that requires recording the estimated value of stock based compensation in the statement of operations 
revenue 
revenues were million in and million in the following table breaks down revenue by major source in thousands contract revenue hcv nucleoside compound drug discovery research collaboration gilead sciences  inc hcv non nucleoside compound drug discovery research collaboration novartis prestara collaborations watson pharmaceuticals  inc and tanabe seiyaku co  ltd 
total contract revenue royalties total revenue in both and  our most significant source of revenue was from our collaboration with gilead sciences  inc the agreement with gilead that we entered into during has a three year initial research term  with gilead having an option to extend for one additional year 
upon signing the agreement we received an million up front payment  and we are entitled to receive quarterly payments aggregating approximately million over the initial three year term as we work with gilead to discover additional nucleoside compounds that inhibit replication of hcv 
if gilead exercises its option to extend the research term by one year  additional payments would be due to genelabs 
we recognized contract revenue of million under the gilead agreement in  comprised of million in research funding and million for the pro rata share of the up front license 
table of contents fee 
revenue recognized under the collaboration during was greater than that recognized in due to an increase in the research funding rate in the fourth quarter of in we recognized revenue from the collaboration with novartis which we signed in june the agreement has a two year initial research term  with novartis having an option to extend for one additional year 
upon signing the agreement we received a nonrefundable up front payment of million and are also entitled to additional minimum research funding totaling approximately million over the two year term of the initial term for work performed on the collaboration 
if novartis exercises its option to extend the research term by one year  additional payments would be due 
in we recognized revenue of million for a pro rata share of the up front license fee and million for research funding 
we expect our collaboration with novartis to be our most significant source of revenue in in  our revenue related to prestara decreased by million compared to primarily due to a lengthening of the term we estimate it could take to potentially obtain approval of prestara in the united states and japan 
our lengthening of the estimated term to potentially receive approval was made based on current expectations and our determination that approval would not be possible by the previous time through which we were recognizing revenue 
the amortization period for unearned revenue related to the watson agreement was extended from december  to december  the amortization period for unearned revenue related to the tanabe agreement was extended from december  to december  the amortization for both agreements could change again in the future based on the final design for another clinical trial  our ability to initiate a clinical trial  and discussions with existing and potential corporate partners  among other things 
in addition  we receive royalties from other parties which aggregated approximately million in  compared to million in operating expenses 
the following table breaks down operating expenses into the two major categories of costs in our financial statements in thousands 
change research and development general and administrative total operating expenses all operating expenses are related to genelabs business of discovering and developing pharmaceutical products 
changes in these costs are explained in more detail below 
research and development expenses background we are in the business of drug discovery and development and have not developed any products that have been approved for sale 
because the majority of our costs are directly related to discovering and developing new drugs  we classify these costs as research and development and expense them as they are incurred 
research and development expenses include salaries and benefits for employees directly involved in these activities  supplies and chemicals used in laboratories  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract and outside service fees  and allocated facilities and overhead costs 
over the last several years the majority of genelabs research and development activities have been focused on two key areas the discovery of entirely new drugs and the development of prestara tm for lupus 

table of contents research and development expenses by project in  million of operating expenses were in research and development  compared to million in  an increase of million 
the following table breaks down the research and development expenses by major category in thousands change drug discovery hepatitis c virus  or hcv drug development prestara tm support costs and other research and development total research and development drug discovery during and  substantially all of our drug discovery efforts were directed toward three separate hepatitis c virus research programs  which are concentrated on identifying a new drug to combat infection with hcv 
two of these programs target the hcv nsb rna dependent rna polymerase the enzyme directly responsible for replication of the hcv genome  although through different mechanisms 
we refer to one of these mechanisms as our nucleoside program and we refer to the other as the non nucleoside program 
our third hcv drug discovery program targets the hcv nsa protein  a different viral enzyme that is also required for viral replication 
part of our drug discovery process includes continued testing of our preclinical drug candidates and identification of additional potential lead compounds 
costs for our drug discovery program increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily a result of continued growth in our hcv drug discovery programs  and to the greatest extent among our non nucleoside and hcv nsa programs 
this growth included a increase in the number of scientists we have working on these programs 
costs increased as a result of increased personnel and a greater usage of chemicals and lab supplies used by the scientists 
during we also entered into a new contract for optimizing the synthesis route and scale up manufacturing for one of our hcv non nucleoside preclinical candidates and we conducted additional external preclinical studies of promising compounds 
as a result of the recent collaboration with novartis  we anticipate that external costs incurred by us under our hcv non nucleoside program will be lower than previously anticipated  however  these savings will likely be more than offset by continued increases in internal costs under the program 
since initiating our first drug discovery program in  genelabs has built medicinal chemistry  combinatorial chemistry  computational modeling  molecular biology  assay development and high throughput screening  drug metabolism  pharmacokinetics and toxicology capabilities 
genelabs has incurred direct drug discovery costs of approximately million through december  of this amount  million relates to our hcv drug discovery programs which began in early due to the nature of drug discovery research  we cannot reliably estimate the outcome of scientific experiments  many of which will impact the design and conduct of subsequent scientific experiments  and all of which provide additional information on both the direction of the research program and likelihood of its success 
as such  the potential timing for key future events that may occur in our drug discovery programs cannot reliably be estimated and we cannot estimate whether a compound will advance to a later stage of development or when we may determine that a program is no longer viable for potentially producing a drug candidate 
we also cannot reasonably predict the costs to reach these stages  and cannot predict whether any of our compounds will result in commercial products or lead to revenue for the company 
going forward into  we may continue to expand our existing hcv drug discovery programs and we will continue to explore new drug targets as potential programs 
however  the resources available to us  outcomes of current and planned scientific experiments and outcomes of corporate partnering discussions may affect our plans 
management continually evaluates the status of our drug discovery research programs and expects to continue to devote resources toward these efforts  while at the same time managing the level of expenditures to balance limited resources and the various drug discovery and development opportunities 

table of contents drug development prestara tm expenses for prestara decreased to million in compared to million in  a reduction of 
following a clinical trial that did not meet its endpoint in late we continued to decrease the staff working on the program through the expenses also include the effect of a million reversal of costs previously accrued under the program 
genelabs began developing prestara tm for systemic lupus erythematosus in when genelabs licensed exclusive rights to patents related to prestara from stanford university 
to potentially develop this investigational new drug we have incurred direct costs of approximately million through december  in we anticipate that expenses for prestara will be consistent with the total expenditures for we expect to incur continued costs for the development of a clinical trial protocol and possibly other matters 
future development decisions and the future development of prestara for lupus will depend on a number of factors  including discussions with and actions by the fda  discussions with and actions by our prestara collaborators and potential collaborators  and our ability to secure financing to complete its development 
we may decide to discontinue development of prestara in  which may further reduce the costs from planned levels  depending on the timing of the decision 
support costs and other research and development support costs and other research and development is primarily comprised of costs necessary to maintain a research and development facility  such as rent  insurance  depreciation  support staff  utilities  maintenance  the incentive bonus and stock based compensation  which are allocated based on the headcount ratio between research and development and general and administrative 
support costs and other research and development included within research and development were million in compared to million in the following table breaks down the major components of support costs and other research and development in thousands facility rent  net of sublease income salaries and benefits for lab and facility support personnel insurance  depreciation and property taxes utilities  maintenance and security lab equipment  services and sundry supplies allocation of incentive bonus compensation allocation of stock based compensation other items total support and other research and development costs the increase in expenses was primarily due to compensation related costs recorded during as compared to in we recorded increased expenses for our employee incentive bonus compensation program after we met board specified criteria resulting in the removal of payment contingencies in the first half of the year 
in we had reduced the incentive bonus amount due to cash balance contingencies our board of directors has established for the payment of any bonuses to employees 
as of december   the contingency had not been met and accordingly no incentive bonus charge was recorded 
the credit balance in the account for primarily represents the forfeiture of previous years accruals by participants that had been in genelabs long term incentive program 
additionally  in we recorded expenses upon the adoption of sfas r  a new accounting standard that requires recording the estimated value of stock based compensation in the statement of operations 
other costs included in support costs and other research and development were generally comparable in and although we did experience modest decreases in salaries and benefits due to a slight reduction in the number of staff that we require to support our facilities and insurance expenses due to a reduction in our premium for directors and officers coverages 

table of contents in  we do not expect support costs and other research and development  other than the employee incentive bonuses expense  to increase significantly compared to the expenses if we maintain our same level of operations 
in  our costs for the incentive bonus program will depend on our meeting board established contingency criteria and meeting our corporate objectives 
general and administrative in  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for executive management  finance  legal  business development and human resources departments  as well as professional expenses  such as legal and audit  and allocated facilities costs such as rent and insurance 
in our general and administrative expenses include a fee paid to a financial advisor related to the collaboration with novartis 
other increases in compared to included higher charges for the employee incentive bonus program and charges for stock based compensation due to the adoption of sfas r 
these cost increases were partially offset by a decrease in ongoing accounting compliance costs as we were not subject to reporting requirements for internal controls over financial reporting 
we do not expect our general and administrative expenses  excluding the allocation of shared costs  to increase significantly compared to the expenses 
nonoperating income 
interest and other income was million in compared to million in  an increase of million primarily due to a higher average cash balance resulting in increased interest income in years ended december  and introduction 
genelabs net loss was million in  a decrease of million from the million net loss in this decrease in net loss was primarily the result of lower research and development costs and higher contract revenue  partially offset by a gain on the sale of a discontinued operation

these are with watson pharmaceuticals inc for north america and tanabe seiyaku co  ltd 
for japan 
in  our revenue related to prestara decreased by million compared to 
table of contents primarily due to a lengthening of the term we estimate it could take us to potentially obtain approval of prestara in the united states 
we further lengthened this term in as discussed above 
during  we did not recognize revenue related to our linker aided dna amplification license with affymetrix  inc or our hepatitis e vaccine agreement with glaxosmithkline because we did not receive any payments 
in late we ceased providing data analysis services to other parties  and accordingly did not record or receive any revenue during in addition  we receive royalties from other parties which aggregated approximately million in  compared to million in operating expenses 
the following table breaks down operating expenses into the two major categories of costs in our financial statements in thousands 
change research and development general and administrative total operating expenses all operating expenses in and are related to genelabs business of discovering and developing pharmaceutical products 
the two key decreases in operating expenses for compared to were lower costs resulting from our completion of all clinical work on prestara for lupus and lower costs incurred for our employees incentive bonuses  which were partially offset by increased costs on our hepatitis c virus drug discovery research 
these are each explained in more detail below 
research and development expenses by project in  million of operating expenses were in research and development  compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the following table breaks down the research and development expenses by major category in thousands change drug discovery hepatitis c virus  or hcv drug development prestara tm support costs and other research and development total research and development drug discovery costs for our drug discovery program increased to million in from million in drug discovery costs were higher in than in due to our significant expansion of the program beginning in the latter half of  which continued throughout  with most of our hiring of new employees occurring during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of as of december   our research headcount increased by over the amount at the end of costs increased as a result of increased personnel and a greater usage of chemicals and lab supplies used by the scientists 
the percentage increase in costs in compared to was greater than the percentage increase in headcount during due to the timing of hiring in late combined with the hiring of more scientists with advanced degrees such as phd s 
in addition  since we do not have full preclinical development capabilities in our own laboratories  in we required additional outside lab services as our compounds advanced within preclinical development 
the increase in hcv drug discovery costs in also included the addition of a new program  using hcv nsa as a drug target  and further work on the programs targeting the hcv polymerase  including identification of additional potent compounds and the advancement of another one of these to preclinical development status 

table of contents drug development prestara tm costs for prestara decreased to million in compared to million in  a reduction of as we completed a phase iii clinical trial in the third quarter of  completed a follow on open label trial in the third quarter of and significantly decreased the staff working on the program in support costs and other research and development support costs and other research and development is primarily comprised of costs necessary to maintain a research and development facility  such as rent  insurance  depreciation  support staff  utilities  maintenance and the incentive bonus  which are allocated based on the headcount ratio between research and development and general and administrative 
support costs and other research and development included within research and development were million in compared to million in the decrease in expenses during as compared to was primarily due to a reduction of the incentive bonus costs due to the forfeiture of previous years accruals by some participants that had been in genelabs long term incentive program and cash balance contingencies our board of directors established for the payment of any bonuses to employees 
as of december   the contingency had not been met and accordingly no incentive bonus charge was recorded 
other costs included in support costs and other research and development were generally comparable in and  although utilities increased modestly due to higher usage and higher energy costs  and salaries for support personnel decreased as genelabs consolidated operations that were no longer required 
general and administrative in  general and administrative expenses decreased to million from million in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for executive management  finance  legal  business development  human resources and marketing departments  as well as professional expenses  such as legal and audit  and allocated facilities costs such as rent and insurance 
during  lower general and administrative costs were incurred for prestara marketing activities  business development  human resources and reduced allocation of costs that are shared between research and development and general and administrative expenses  such as the employee incentive bonus 
nonoperating income 
interest and other income was million in compared to million in  an increase of million primarily due to higher average interest rates 
in  we recorded million in a gain on the sale of our discontinued operations and income from its operations 
because this transaction occurred during  there was no comparable income during liquidity and capital resources we assess liquidity primarily by the cash and cash equivalents available to fund our operations 
genelabs had cash and cash equivalents of million at december   which was an increase of million from the cash and cash equivalents at december  during we received a million up front payment upon signing of a collaboration and license agreement with novartis and million in net proceeds from a placement of common stock 
these cash inflows were offset in by cash used in completing these transactions and cash used in operations to fund our continued research on the discovery of new treatments for hepatitis c virus infection and development of prestara 
subsequent to december  our cash and cash equivalents balance was affected by a private placement of common stock which we completed on february  for estimated net proceeds of million and the sale of our equity investment in genovate biotechnology ltd on january  for estimated net proceeds of million 
on february  we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million on hand 
genelabs presently estimates that our current cash resources will be adequate to provide liquidity for our existing operations into fiscal year this does not include the funding of a new trial for prestara for which we will require outside sources of financing to complete 

table of contents longer term  genelabs believes its liquidity and capital resources will be materially impacted by our success or failure or the success or failure of our collaborators in reaching milestones under corporate collaborations  the progress of the company s unpartnered drug discovery programs  the ability to enter into or modify existing corporate collaborations  and regulatory actions regarding its investigational drugs 
since genelabs inception  we have operated at a loss and have funded operations primarily through public and private offerings of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  contract revenues 
we expect to incur substantial additional costs  including research costs for drug discovery 
the amount of additional costs in our business plans will depend on numerous factors including the progress of our research and development programs and the actions of corporate collaborators 
to meet our capital needs through the end of and later years we will require additional funding  but additional funds may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
the unavailability of additional funds could delay or prevent the development  approval or marketing of some or all of our products and technologies  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
other contractual arrangements 
genelabs principal research  clinical development and office facilities are leased from third parties under operating leases 
other than the facility operating leases  genelabs does not have any financial off balance sheet arrangements 
all companies in california that use radioactive materials must provide assurance to the radiologic health branch of the california department of health services cdhs that funds will be available when needed for any future decommissioning activities
