item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company that develops novel drugs for pain management and oncology 
we have three investigational drug candidates in clinical programs 
remoxy and pti are proprietary  abuse resistant forms of opioid drugs 
oxytrex is a novel  next generation painkiller that potentially offers less physical dependence than currently marketed opioid painkillers 
we are also developing a novel radio labeled monoclonal antibody to treat metastatic melanoma  a rare but deadly form of skin cancer 
two of our novel drug candidates are currently in phase iii clinical programs remoxy  an abuse resistant version of long acting oxycodone  and oxytrex  a novel oral opioid painkiller for the treatment of severe chronic pain 
we and king pharmaceuticals  inc  or king  are engaged in a strategic alliance to develop and commercialize remoxy and other abuse resistant opioid painkillers 
king made an upfront cash payment of million to us at the closing of this strategic alliance in december in february  we and king announced the completion of a special protocol assessment  or spa  with the us food and drug administration  or fda  in connection with the clinical development of remoxy 
we are conducting a pivotal phase iii clinical trial with remoxy in approximately patients with moderate to severe chronic pain  pursuant to the spa 
in august  we and king announced the initiation of a phase i clinical trial program of a second abuse resistant drug candidate  called pti in connection with the acceptance by the fda of the investigational new drug application  or ind  for pti  king made a milestone payment to us of million 
we could also receive from king up to million in additional milestone payments in the course of clinical development of remoxy  pti and other abuse resistant opioid painkillers under the strategic alliance 
in addition  subject to certain limitations  king is obligated to fund development expenses incurred by us pursuant to the collaboration agreement 
king is obligated to fund the commercialization expenses of  and has the exclusive right to market and sell  drugs developed in connection with the strategic alliance 
king is obligated to pay us a royalty on net sales of drugs developed in connection with the strategic alliance  except as to the first billion in net sales of such drugs  for which the royalty is set at 
although we were profitable in based principally on revenues recognized from king and interest income  we have yet to generate any revenues from product sales 
through december   we have recorded an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities  salaries and other personnel related costs and general corporate expenses 
research and development activities include costs of preclinical and clinical trials as well as clinical supplies associated with our drug candidates 
salaries and other personnel related costs include non cash stock based compensation associated with options granted to employees and non employees 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially from period to period as a result of the timing and enrollment rates of clinical trials for our drug candidates and our need for clinical supplies 
we expect to continue to use significant cash resources in our operations for the next several years 
our cash requirements for operating activities and capital expenditures will increase substantially in the future as we continue to conduct preclinical and clinical trials for our drug candidates  
table of contents seek regulatory approvals for our drug candidates  develop  formulate  manufacture and commercialize our drug candidates  implement additional internal systems and develop new infrastructure  acquire or in license additional products or technologies  or expand the use of our technology  maintain  defend and expand the scope of our intellectual property  and hire additional personnel 
product revenue will depend on our ability to receive regulatory approvals for  and successfully market  our drug candidates 
if our development efforts result in regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our drug candidates  we will generate revenue from direct sales of our drugs and or  if we license our drugs to future collaborators  from the receipt of license fees and royalties from sales of licensed products 
we conduct our research and development programs through a combination of internal and collaborative programs 
we rely on arrangements with universities  our collaborators  contract research organizations and clinical research sites for a significant portion of our product development efforts 
we focus substantially all our research and development efforts on the research and development of opioid drugs for the treatment of pain 
the following table summarizes expenses by category for research and development efforts in thousands years ended december  compensation contractor fees supplies other common costs contractor fees generally include expenses for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
supplies generally include costs for formulation and manufacturing activities 
other generally includes the allocation of common costs such as facilities 
our technology has been applied across certain of our portfolio of drug candidates 
data  know how  personnel  clinical results  research results and other matters related to the research and development of any one of our drug candidates also relate to  and further the development of  our other drug candidates 
for example  we expect that results of non clinical studies  such as pharmacokinetics  toxicology and other studies  regarding certain components of our drug candidate remoxy to be applicable to the other potential drug candidates that may arise out of our collaboration with king since all such potential drug candidates are expected to utilize such components 
as a result  costs allocated to a specific drug candidate may not necessarily reflect the actual costs surrounding research and development of that drug candidate due to cross application of the foregoing 
in november  we announced that we are developing a novel antibody technology that may transform how metastatic melanoma is treated 
we spent approximately million on this technology  primarily in contractor fees and supplies  during estimating the dates of completion of clinical development  and the costs to complete development of our drug candidates would be highly speculative  subjective and potentially misleading 
pharmaceutical products take a significant amount of time to research  develop and commercialize 
the clinical trial portion of the development of a new drug alone usually spans several years 
we expect to reassess our future research and development plans based on our review of data we receive from our current research and development activities 
the cost and pace of our future research and development activities are linked and subject to change 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and interest income in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those estimates related to contract agreements  research collaborations and investments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following items in our financial statements require significant estimates and judgments expenses for clinical trials 
expenses for clinical trials are incurred from planning through patient enrollment to reporting of the underlying data 
we estimate expenses incurred for clinical trials that are in process based on patient enrollment and based on clinical data collection and management 
costs that are associated with patient enrollment are recognized as each patient in the clinical trial completes enrollment 
estimated clinical trial costs related to enrollment can vary based on numerous factors  including expected number of patients in trials  the number of patients that do not complete participation in a trial  and when a patient drops out of a trial 
information about patient enrollment can become available significantly after we report our expenses for clinical trials  in which case we would change our estimate of the remaining cost of a trial 
costs that are based on clinical data collection and management are recognized based on estimates of unbilled goods and services received 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we would accrue an amount based on estimates of the remaining non cancelable obligations associated with winding down the clinical trial 
stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
this statement requires companies to recognize expense in the income statement for the fair value all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of employee stock options 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its interpretations  or apb  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
we adopted sfas r on january  using the modified prospective transition method 
we record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
accordingly  stock based compensation expense recognized in the year ended december  includes million in stock based compensation cost for all outstanding stock based awards 
prior to january   we used the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based awards granted to employees and directors in accordance with apb and its interpretations 
accordingly  we did not recognize compensation cost in our financial statements prior to january  for these awards because stock options granted to employees and directors had exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair value of the underlying security at the time the stock option was granted 
in adopting sfas r  companies must choose among alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions 
after assessing alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions  we continue to use the black scholes option valuation model  or black scholes and use the single option award approach and straight line attribution method for stock options granted since january  using this approach  the compensation cost is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of each respective stock option  generally four years 
prior to adoption of sfas r  we calculated the value of options granted to employees and directors for disclosure in the footnotes to our financial statements pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  using black scholes  the multiple option award approach and the accelerated attribution method 
this approach uses a graded vesting method over the vesting period of each respective stock option  generally four years 
the accelerated attribution method results in recognizing as compensation cost more than of the fair value of an option in year one  with the 
table of contents remainder recognized in decreasing amounts from year two to year four 
under the modified prospective transition method of sfas r  we will continue to calculate compensation cost for options granted prior to january  using the multiple option award approach and accelerated attribution method 
we estimate forfeitures when recognizing expense under sfas r and adjust this estimate periodically based on the extent to which future actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
accordingly  we have estimated forfeiture percentages for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption and for awards granted subsequent to the date of adoption 
revenue recognition and deferred program fee revenue 
in connection with our strategic alliance with king we recognize program fee revenue  collaboration revenue and milestone revenue 
program fee revenue is derived from the upfront payment from king received in december and is recognized ratably over our estimate of the development period of four drug candidates expected to be developed under the strategic alliance with king 
of those drug candidates  remoxy is in phase iii clinical trials  one drug candidate is in phase i clinical trials and two potential drug candidates are at the pre clinical stage 
we currently estimate the development period for all four expected drug candidates to extend through july collaboration revenues from reimbursement of development expenses  which are invoiced one month in arrears  are recognized when costs are incurred pursuant to the strategic alliance with king  unless we know that king has not completed to its satisfaction their review of our submitted invoices 
therefore  our collaboration revenues may be impacted by the timeliness of our addressing any questions king may have on the invoices we submit to them as well as the length of time it takes king to complete its review once we have addressed their questions  and although we only invoice king for development expenses incurred by us that we believe qualify for reimbursement under our collaborative agreement  king may not ultimately agree with our determination of what constitutes a qualifying development expense 
king is obligated to pay us milestone payments contingent upon the achievement of certain substantive events in the clinical development of remoxy and the other abuse resistant opioid painkillers under the strategic alliance 
we recognize milestone payments from king as revenue when we achieve the underlying developmental milestone as the milestone payments are not dependent upon any other future activities or achievement of any other future milestones and the achievement of each of the developmental milestones were substantively at risk and contingent at the effective date of the collaboration 
substantial effort is involved in achieving each of the developmental milestones 
these milestones represent the culmination of discrete earnings processes and the amount of each milestone payment is reasonable in relation with the level of effort associated with the achievement of the milestone 
each milestone payment is non refundable and non creditable when made 
the ongoing research and development services being provided to king under the collaboration are priced at fair value based upon the reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the collaboration with king 
income taxes 
we make estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense 
we have accumulated significant deferred tax assets 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of net operating loss and tax credit carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any 
we are uncertain of the timing and amount of any future earnings 
accordingly  we fully offset the total deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance 
we may in the future determine that some  or all  of our deferred tax assets will likely be realized  in which case we will reduce our valuation allowance in the quarter in which such determination is made 
if the valuation allowance is reduced  we may recognize a benefit from income taxes in our statement of operations in that period 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue program fee revenue king paid us a million upfront fee in connection with the closing of our strategic alliance with king in december revenues recognized from amortization of this upfront fee were and million in the 
table of contents years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect to recognize the remainder of the program fee ratably over our estimate of the development period under the strategic alliance with king 
we currently estimate the development period for all four expected drug candidates to extend through july revenue collaboration revenue collaboration revenues were million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
these revenues related to reimbursement of our development expenses incurred pursuant to the king strategic alliance 
we expect the amount and timing of collaboration revenue to fluctuate in relation to the amount and timing of the underlying research and development expenses  as well as the timing of completion of king s review of submitted expenses 
for example  we have not recognized collaboration revenue of approximately million related to costs incurred by us between september and december  because king has informed us that they are still reviewing the invoice we submitted to them in the fourth quarter of  and they have asked for additional supporting documentation and clarification in order to complete their review 
we expect king s review to be completed in the first half of revenue milestone revenue milestone revenue was million for the year end december  in connection with the acceptance by the fda of the investigational new drug application for pti  king made a non refundable  non creditable milestone payment to us of million 
we had no corresponding milestone revenue in research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of costs of drug development work associated with our drug candidates  including preclinical testing  clinical trials  clinical supplies and related formulation and design costs  and salaries and other personnel related expenses 
research and development expense increased to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to increases in clinical and development activities for remoxy and pti and non cash stock related compensation costs associated with the adoption of sfas r 
we expect research and development expenses to fluctuate over the next several years as we continue our development efforts 
we expect our development efforts to result in our drug candidates progressing through various stages of clinical trials  including our phase iii clinical trial of remoxy  and current and potential clinical trials for our other abuse resistant drug candidates  as well as further clinical development of oxytrex 
king is obligated to reimburse development expenses for remoxy and other abuse resistant drug candidates pursuant to our collaboration 
we expect to continue other development efforts on our drug candidates 
our research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of our development activities and the results of clinical trials and preclinical studies 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consist primarily of compensation and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expense increased to million from million in the years ended 
table of contents december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to increases in non cash stock related compensation costs associated with the adoption of sfas r 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase over the next several years in connection with precommercialization and commercialization activities for our drug candidates 
the increase may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of these activities and the results of clinical trials and preclinical studies 
interest and other income interest and other income increased to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily due to increases in average balances of marketable securities and  to a lesser extent  increases in prevailing interest rates on investments in marketable securities 
we expect our interest income to decrease in the future as we use cash to fund our operations 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes is comprised of million for federal taxes and million for state taxes 
in  king made an upfront cash payment of million to us in connection with our strategic alliance 
we have taxable income for primarily due to the recognition in of million of the upfront cash payment for income tax purposes 
we have reduced our taxable income for with deductions related to a combination of our net operating losses and tax credits from prior years 
we do not expect to provide for income taxes in because we expect to incur net losses in years ended december  and revenues program fee revenue king paid us a million upfront fee in connection with the closing of our strategic alliance with king in december revenues recognized from amortization of the upfront fee were million in the fourth quarter of for recognition of the revenue for the period from the execution of the agreement in november to the end of revenues collaboration revenue collaboration revenues were million in the fourth quarter of  related to reimbursement of our development expenses incurred pursuant to the king strategic alliance from the execution of the agreement in november to the end of we did not have any corresponding collaboration revenue in research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of costs of drug development work associated with our drug candidates  including preclinical testing  clinical trials  clinical supplies and related formulation and design costs  and salaries and other personnel related expenses 
research and development expense decreased to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to lower clinical trial activity in as compared to this decrease was offset in part by increased formulation and development activities for remoxy and other preclinical activities as well as increased compensation related expenses 

table of contents general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expense increased to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily due to an increases in headcount and general corporate activities  offset in part by decreased non cash stock based compensation expense in as compared to interest and other income interest and other income increased to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily due to increases in yields on our investments in marketable securities and  to a lesser extent  in average balances of marketable securities 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private securities offerings 
additionally  in december  we received a million program fee under our strategic alliance with king 
we intend to continue to use the proceeds from these offerings and from this program fee to fund research and development activities  capital expenditures  working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the years ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  in  we incurred approximately million of expenses related to development of our abuse resistant drug candidates under our strategic alliance with king that remain subject to review by king  and king has requested additional supporting documentation and clarification of amounts that we have invoiced them 
we expect that king will complete this review in the first half of our investing activities to purchase property  equipment and leasehold improvements used cash of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  other investing activities for both these years consisted primarily of the purchase and sale of marketable securities 
we expect to continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our operations 
net cash provided by financing increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in issuances of common stock from our stock plan and our employee stock purchase plan 
we have million of total deferred tax assets at december  realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any 
we are uncertain about the timing and amount of any future earnings 
we have concluded that it was more likely than not that such deferred tax assets would not be realized 
accordingly  we fully offset the deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance 
we lease approximately  square feet of general office space 
our lease expires in under the terms of our real property lease  annual minimum lease payments are as follows as of december  in thousands total future minimum lease payments in  we expect to increase the amount of office space we lease 
we have license agreements that require us to make milestone payments upon the successful achievement of milestones  including clinical milestones 
our license agreements also require us to pay certain royalties to our 
table of contents licensors if we succeed in fully commercializing products under these license agreements 
all of these potential future payments are cancelable as of december  our formulation agreement with durect corporation obligates us to make certain milestone payments upon achieving clinical milestones and regulatory milestones 
king is obligated to reimburse us for any of our milestone payments and royalty payments to durect corporation 
we have an accumulated deficit of million at december  we expect our cash requirements to be significant in the future 
the amount and timing of our future cash requirements will depend on regulatory and market acceptance of our drug candidates and the resources we devote to researching and developing  formulating  manufacturing  commercializing and supporting our products 
we believe that our current resources should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
we may seek additional future funding through public or private financing within this timeframe  if such funding is available and on terms acceptable to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting for interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and is required to be adopted by the company in the first quarter of the cumulative effects  if any  of applying fin will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption 
the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on its results of operations and financial condition and is not yet in a position to determine such effects 
in fiscal  we adopted fsp no 
fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this adoption did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  by approximately million 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  government and non government debt securities and or money market funds that invest in such securities 
we have no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments 
as of december   our investments consisted of short term investments in corporate and government notes and obligations or in money market accounts and checking funds with variable  market rates of interest 
we believe our credit risk is immaterial
