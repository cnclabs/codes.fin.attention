item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our results of operations depend mainly on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on our loan and investment portfolios and interest expense paid on our deposits and borrowed funds 
results of operations are also affected by fee income from banking operations  provisions for loan losses  gains losses on sales of loans and securities available for sale and other miscellaneous income 
our non interest expenses consist primarily of compensation and employee benefits  office occupancy  technology  marketing  general administrative expenses and income tax expense 
our results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly with respect to changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or make significant assumptions that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income  to be critical accounting policies 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses which is charged against income 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of the most critical for the bank 
the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the assumptions utilized and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for loan losses 
as a substantial amount of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate  appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans and discounted cash flow valuations of properties are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans 
assumptions for appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are instrumental in determining the value of properties 
overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly impact the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined 
the assumptions supporting such appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are carefully reviewed by management to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans 
management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including  but not limited to  current economic conditions  delinquency statistics  geographic and industry concentrations  the adequacy of the underlying collateral  the financial strength of the borrower  results of internal and external loan reviews and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions 
the analysis of the allowance for loan losses has two components specific and general allocations 
specific allocations are made for loans that are determined to be impaired 
impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or  for collateral dependent loans  the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses 
the general allocation is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan  risk weighting if applicable and payment history 
we also analyze historical loss experience  delinquency trends  general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations 
this analysis establishes factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the general allocations 
actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance for loan losses we have established which could have a material negative effect on our financial results 
deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is established 
we consider the determination of this valuation allowance to be a critical accounting policy because of the need to exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets  including projections of future taxable income 
these judgments and estimates are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required if the amount of taxes recoverable through loss carryback declines  or if we project lower levels of future taxable income 
such a valuation allowance would be established through a charge to income tax expense which would adversely affect our operating results 
business strategy our business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized and profitable community bank dedicated to providing quality customer service 
our business strategy historically has been to emphasize one to four family residential mortgage lending 
while we will continue to engage in this type of lending  management has determined to broaden the range of our products and services to enhance profitability  consistent with safety and soundness 
in recent years  we have significantly expanded our multi family  commercial real estate and construction lending 
we have also introduced additional products and services  such as debit cards and internet banking 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy 
highlights of our business strategy are as follows remaining a community oriented institution 
we were established in brooklyn  new york in  and we have been operating continuously since that time 
we have been  and continue to be  committed to meeting the financial needs of the communities in which we operate  and we are dedicated to providing quality personal service to our customers 
although historically our principal business activity has been accepting deposits from the public and using those funds to originate one to four family mortgage loans  in recent years we have been originating more commercial real estate loan products and a wider variety of residential real estate loan products to meet the needs of our customers 
if such loans do not satisfy our criteria for retention in our loan portfolio  they generally can be sold in the secondary market 
continuing to increase our multi family  commercial real estate and construction lending 
historically  we have emphasized one to four family residential lending within our market area 
while one to four family loan originations remain an important form of loans because of our expertise with this type of lending  in the past five years we have emphasized the origination of loans secured by multi family properties and commercial real estate and construction loans as a means of increasing our interest and fee income 
multi family  commercial real estate and construction lending generally expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by one to four family real estate 
the repayment of multi family  commercial real estate and construction loans depends upon the business and financial condition of the borrower and  in the case of construction loans  on the economic viability of projects financed 
consequently  we  like other financial institutions  generally charge higher rates of interest for these types of loans compared to one to four family residential loans 
we have invested in a new loan servicing system and additional personnel to allow us to service these types of loans more efficiently 
increasing our real estate lending capacity 
the additional capital raised in the stock offering increased our lending capacity by enabling us to originate more loans and loans with larger balances 
this permits us to serve borrowers with larger lending needs and to originate larger loans than we have originated in the past 
utilizing the net proceeds we received in the offering to better manage our interest rate risk and grow our assets 
with long term interest rates at low levels  we have managed our interest rate risk by maintaining a portion of our assets in short term liquid assets  such as cash and cash equivalents  short term investment securities and mortgage related securities that provide significant cash flows 
this strategy positioned us to reinvest our short term liquid assets in higher yielding loans and investments once interest rates began to rise 
during the more recent period of decreasing interest rates  we have continued to reduce our security investments and redeploy those funds to pay down borrowings  while still maintaining a high level of short term liquid assets 
maintaining a high level of short term liquid assets  however  generates less interest income than would have been generated if we had invested in longer term loans and investments 
at september   million  or of our assets  was invested in cash or cash equivalents  and million  or of our assets  was invested in certificates of deposit and securities that mature within three years 
the net proceeds from the stock offering increased our capital and provided management with greater flexibility to manage interest rate risk and increase our interest earning assets  including our investment in longer term  higher yielding loans and securities 
facilitate growth through de novo branching 
we have established financial  geographic and other criteria to evaluate potential new branch offices in our market area 
while we continue to review potential branch sites  there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will open such offices 
the bank anticipates opening its fifth branch office in commack  suffolk county  new york in the second fiscal quarter of maintaining high asset quality 
we have focused on improving and maintaining strong asset quality by following conservative underwriting criteria  and primarily originating loans secured by real estate

we adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows  pay real estate taxes on mortgage loans  repay our borrowings and to fund loan commitments 
we also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives 
our primary sources of liquidity are deposits  amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  and earnings and funds provided from operations  as well as access to federal home loan bank advances 
while scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions  and rates offered by our competition 
we set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits 
in addition  we invest excess funds in short term interest earning assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
a significant portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents  which are a product of our operating  investing and financing activities 
at september   million of our assets were invested in cash and due from banks 
our primary sources of cash are principal repayments on loans  proceeds from the calls and maturities of investment securities  principal repayments of mortgage backed securities and increases in deposit accounts 
currently  we sell longer term fixed rate mortgage loans  and we syndicate and sell participation interests in portions of our multi family  commercial real estate and construction loans 
such activity is expected to continue so long as it meets our operational and financial needs 
in addition  we invest excess funds in short term interest earning assets and other assets  which provide liquidity to meet our lending requirements 
certificates of deposit and short term investment securities maturing in less than three years totaled million at september  as of september   we had million in borrowings outstanding from the federal home loan bank of new york and we have access to additional federal home loan bank advances of up to million

certificates of deposit due within one year of september  totaled million  or of certificates of deposit 
the large percentage of certificates of deposits that mature within one year reflects customers hesitancy to invest their funds for long periods in the current low interest rate environment 
if these maturing deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including other certificates of deposit and borrowings 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before september  we believe  however  based on past experience  that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered

net cash provided by used in operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended september    and  respectively 
these amounts differ from our net income because of a variety of cash receipts and disbursements that did not affect net income for the respective periods  the most significant of which are originations and sales of loans held for sale

in addition  as part of the reorganization and stock offering  the employee stock ownership plan trust borrowed funds from the company to purchase a number of shares equal to of the common stock issued in the stock offering 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in our financial statements 
these transaction involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit 
for information about our loan commitments and unused lines of credit  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for fiscal year  we did not engage in any off balance sheet transactions other than loan origination and loan sale commitments in the normal course of our lending activities 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
consequently  our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
our assets  consisting primarily of mortgage loans  have longer maturities than our liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits 
as a result  a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  our board of directors has approved guidelines for managing the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives 
senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the audit committee of the board of directors meets as needed to review our asset liability policies and interest rate risk position 
we have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
during the low interest rate environment that has existed in recent years  we have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk i maintaining a high level of short term liquid assets invested in cash and cash equivalents  short term securities and mortgage related securities that provide significant cash flows  ii generally selling longer term mortgage loans  and iii lengthening the average term of our certificates of deposit 
by investing in short term  liquid instruments  we believe we are better positioned to react to increases in market interest rates 
however  investments in shorter term securities and cash and cash equivalents generally bear lower yields than longer term investments 
thus  during periods of declining interest rates  our strategy of investing in liquid instruments has resulted in lower levels of interest income than would have resulted from investing in longer term loans and investments 
the net proceeds from the offering have increased our capital and provided management with greater flexibility to manage our interest rate risk 
in particular  management has leveraged the capital we received to increase our interest earning assets 
management intends to lengthen the maturity of our earning assets as interest rates increase  which in turn should result in a higher yielding portfolio of interest earning assets 
net portfolio value 
the office of thrift supervision requires the computation of amounts by which the net present value of an institution s cash flow from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items the institution s net portfolio value or npv would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the office of thrift supervision provides all institutions that file a consolidated maturity rate schedule as a part of their quarterly thrift financial report with an interest rate sensitivity report of net portfolio value 
the office of thrift supervision simulation model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option based pricing approach to measuring the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value 
historically  the office of thrift supervision model estimated the economic value of each type of asset  liability and off balance sheet contract under the assumption that the united states treasury yield curve increases or decreases instantaneously by to basis points in basis point increments 
however  given the current low level of market interest rates  we did not receive a npv calculation for an interest rate decrease of greater than basis points 
a basis point equals one hundredth of one percent  and basis points equals one percent 
an increase in interest rates from to would mean  for example  a basis point increase in the change in interest rates column below 
the office of thrift supervision provides us the results of the interest rate sensitivity model  which is based on information we provide to the office of thrift supervision to estimate the sensitivity of our net portfolio value 
the table below sets forth  as of september   the latest date for which the office of thrift supervision has provided the bank an interest rate sensitivity report of its net portfolio value and the estimated changes in the bank s net portfolio value that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in the united states treasury yield curve 
npv as a percentage of present value of assets estimated increase decrease in npv change in interest rates basis points increase decrease basis points estimated npv npv ratio amount percent dollars in thousands assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
npv is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest earning assets 
npv ratio represents npv divided by the present value of assets 
the table above indicates that at september   in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  we would experience a increase in net portfolio value 
in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates  we would experience an decrease in net portfolio value 
our interest rate risk management policy in the low interest rate environment that has existed in recent years has emphasized maintaining a significant percentage of our assets in cash and cash equivalents  shorter term securities and mortgage related securities that provide significant cash flows 
the effect of this policy has been to reduce our level of net interest income 
we have been willing to accept reduced levels of income in low interest rate environments in order to be better positioned to reinvest our assets in longer term  higher yielding investments as interest rates rise 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes in net portfolio value requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the net portfolio value table presented assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the net portfolio value table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results
