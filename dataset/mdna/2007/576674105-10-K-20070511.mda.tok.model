item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we report segment information based on how we view our business for evaluating performance and making operating decisions 
for the periods discussed in this item  we report results on the basis of one business segment 
our one segment focuses on providing material based solutions for acoustical and coated applications 
our acoustical material based solutions consist of layers of metal and other materials used to manage noise and vibration quiet steel in such products as automotive body panel laminate parts  brake dampers  engine parts and computer disk drives 
our coated material based solutions include coil coated and electrogalvanized eg protective and decorative coatings applied to coils of metal in a continuous  high speed  roll to roll process for such products as automotive fuel tanks  building products  appliances and lighting fixtures 
these solutions are designed to meet specific customer requirements for the automotive  building and construction  electronics  heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac  appliance and lighting markets 
we utilize a significant level of shared assets and personnel across each of our product categories 
it is common for a single customer to purchase products from several different product categories 
the general state of the principal industries in which we operate presents a number of risks including uncertainty of north american automobile industry the three largest north american automobile manufacturers have all lost market share in recent years and all announced production cuts during calendar that have stretched into calendar these manufacturers represent our three largest customers  and the continued deterioration of market share could affect our future revenues and profits 
in addition  these manufacturers all have contracts with the same automobile workers unions 
some of these union contracts expire in calendar and any lengthy work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits 
pricing and availability of materials the pricing of materials includes the cost of steel  zinc and nickel  as well as  but not limited to  the cost of energy and the cost of petroleum based products 
the price of these materials has risen in the past several years as the availability has declined 
in particular  thin gauged  wide width substrates have been increasingly difficult to obtain 
overcapacity excess capacity continues to exist in the domestic coil coating market resulting in extreme competition in pricing  terms of sale and facility utilization 
shift in supply model as market conditions change  shifts in the supply model for certain products may occur 
we must adapt our pricing strategy accordingly which may affect the comparability of the revenues  operating margins and working capital for the fiscal years presented 
in fiscal  the hard disk drive market shifted its supply model to a toll processing program which excludes the cost of the metal from a package program 
in fiscal  we shifted the pricing of our gas tank product from a toll program to a package program which includes the cost of the metal 
in fiscal  we lost a significant portion of our hard disk drive business due to a change in disk drive design methodology at our largest customer in this sector 
we continue to evaluate our processes to improve operating effectiveness and better manage our production costs 
we have taken a disciplined approach to evaluating and implementing quality  productivity and customer care initiatives utilizing six sigma and lean manufacturing 
additionally  we are in the process of converting all of our manufacturing facilities to one enterprise resource system in order to improve the management of inventory  purchasing  and accounts receivable  among other areas 
upon review of our assets  we identified certain underperforming assets and initiated the closure and sale of these assets in fiscal in february  we completed the sale of our idled elk grove village production line and the related property on which the line was located 
we also closed our coil coating facility in middletown  ohio in july we concluded that operating the remaining coil coating facilities would provide the best opportunity for a greater return to our shareowners 
as a result of the idling of the middletown facility  we recorded a pretax impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal and restructuring charges of million in fiscal on june   we completed a transaction for the sale of substantially all of the assets including fixed assets  intellectual property and other assets of our electronic materials and devices group emd to touchsensor technologies  llc tst in consideration of the release from current and future contractual commitments to tst and the assumption of certain contractual obligations of emd 
as a result of the transaction  we were relieved of the fee obligations under the license agreement with tst 
table of contents in fiscal of million as well as approximately million of obligations related to certain cost sharing agreements between emd and tst for the months ended in november we recorded a loss on the sale of emd assets of million or per diluted common share  net of income tax benefit of million  in the second quarter of fiscal we no longer report emd as a separate segment  rather we report emd as a discontinued operation with all prior period results of operations set forth reflecting that presentation 
in march  we completed the construction of our premier noise  vibration and harshness nvh testing and development application research center facility in michigan  which utilizes the latest in nvh testing hardware and software for the engineering  application and validation of our nvh material solutions 
in an effort to commercialize our laminate products in europe  in the second quarter of fiscal we entered into a strategic alliance with arcelor mittal for the marketing  sale and manufacture of quiet steel to european automobile manufacturers 
as a part of this strategic alliance  arcelor mittal provides for the production of quiet steel in its montataire  france facility while we continue to manage the product and application engineering 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we settled disputes with two suppliers related to defective materials and recorded an after tax recovery of costs of million 
we also recorded tax benefits of million  primarily related to research and development credits 
results of operations as a percentage of net sales fiscal years net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses asset impairments  restructuring and other income from operations total other income expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes loss on discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income loss results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal in thousands fav unfav variance net sales gross profit of net sales selling  general and administrative of net sales during the first quarter of fiscal  we began reporting sales under two types of applications  acoustical and coated  to better reflect our business mix 
sales of electronic products  which were reported separately in prior years  are reported as acoustical sales when sold for disk drive applications and as coated sales when sold for all other electronic applications 
we also reclassified million of other sales in fiscal from acoustical applications to coated applications to more accurately reflect a certain product s application 
significant changes in certain markets within each application are discussed in the following commentary about sales fluctuations 
our commentary does not necessarily reflect the fluctuations of all markets within each application  only those markets considered to have a significant impact on sales during the periods discussed 

table of contents net sales 
in thousands net sales application fiscal fiscal variance variance acoustical coated total sales of acoustical materials  which are primarily to automotive and disk drive manufactures  decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales of body panel laminate decreased  from million to million  primarily due to the overall softness of the north american auto industry 
according to industry statistics  production of cars and light trucks containing quiet steel declined an average of  with the production of some platforms down more than 
the significant decrease in automobile production by the us automakers in the second half of calendar has reduced the demand for body panel laminate parts 
we expect this slowdown in the us auto market to continue through the first half of fiscal sales in the brake market during fiscal decreased  from million to million  primarily due to the softness in the auto industry and an overall reduction in the quantity of inventory carried by our customers 
growth in our european brake market of approximately helped to partially offset the weakness in the us auto industry 
disk drive sales decreased  from million to million  as our largest customer in this sector changed its disk drive design methodology 
we are actively seeking new markets  both in the us and abroad  for our acoustical products 
we believe our application research center in michigan and the expansion of our application development center in europe will provide us with the opportunity to showcase the value that our acoustical products can provide to our customers 
coated materials sales decreased in fiscal to million from million in the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in appliance hvac sales partially offset by increased gas tank sales and lighting sales 
appliance hvac sales decreased  from million to million  primarily due to the loss of a significant film laminate customer as well as two customers moving the production of certain appliances from the us to mexico 
gas tank sales increased  from million to million  principally due to increased sales volume  a change in the product formulation and the full year impact of the change in the pricing model to a package basis from a toll basis whereby the cost of metal is now included in the sales price with little or no associated profit 
lighting sales increased  from million to million  primarily due to new business 
gross profit 
our fiscal gross profit was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in the prior fiscal year 
of the total million decrease in gross profit  million was due to decreased sales volume  million was due to increases in raw material costs and million was due to decreases in our sales price 
these unfavorable variances were partially offset by million of cost reductions and savings from quality initiatives 
the decrease in gross profit and the gross margin was primarily due to the significant decrease in sales of higher margin acoustical products 
we had additional margin compression due to the increased cost of raw materials  especially zinc and nickel  that we were not able to fully pass on to customers through pricing 
we also experienced some sales price declines primarily related to a program for one high volume product 
we experienced significant savings from our quality initiatives in managing yields  decreasing customer claims and maximizing recoveries of partially defective runs 
we are continuing to evaluate all of our processes to better manage our production costs and improve the quality of our products 
sg a expenses 
sg a expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in these expenses was primarily due to a decrease in legal  consulting and professional fees of million  the collection of a million account receivable in fiscal that had been previously written off  and environmental expenses of million recorded in fiscal that did not repeat 
restructuring expenses 
the production employees at our morrisville  pennsylvania facility were covered by a union contract that expired in march new terms and conditions of employment were implemented which included a voluntary severance package 
a total of employees accepted the 
table of contents voluntary severance package 
we commenced hiring employees to replace those who elected the severance package in april the employees at morrisville are currently working under the terms and conditions of employment we implemented 
we recorded restructuring expenses of million in severance and related expenses in fiscal related to this restructuring 
the entire restructuring reserve for this action was paid during fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we announced the closing of our middletown coil coating facility 
in conjunction with this announcement and other restructuring actions  we recorded restructuring expenses of million for the fiscal year ended february  a total of employees were affected by this restructuring 
of the total amount recorded  million related to the middletown closing and million related to other restructuring actions 
we also recorded million in expenses for these restructuring plans during fiscal primarily to cover medical related expenses that were higher than originally planned 
this restructuring liability was fully paid as of february  and there was no activity for these restructuring actions in fiscal in fiscal  the company entered into a separation arrangement related to the resignation of the former chairman  president and chief executive officer 
as a result of this arrangement  the company had a pretax charge to earnings of million in the first quarter of fiscal of this amount  million was scheduled to be paid out over two years and the remainder related to the executive s non contributory supplemental pension plan to be paid out in accordance with the plan 
we reduced these restructuring reserves by  in fiscal and increased these reserves by  in fiscal based on a revision to the total amounts expected to be paid out for these plans  primarily related to medical expenses 
cash of  was paid during fiscal the consolidated balance sheet as of february   includes a total of  in accrued expenses and  in other long term liabilities related to this restructuring action 
the restructuring reserve as of february   is presented in the chart below which includes the fiscal  and restructuring plans

total other income  net  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest income  net  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to interest earned on our cash balances which were higher in fiscal  interest of million received on an income tax refund and interest of million on the collection of an account receivable which had previously been written off 
equity in results of joint venture was income of million in fiscal as compared to income of million in fiscal see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled joint venture and partnership 
income taxes 
our effective income tax provision rate for continuing operations was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the significant decrease in the effective rate from the prior year is primarily due to establishing research and development tax credits of million  or  and the closing of an internal revenue service audit of million  or 
additionally  our valuation allowances on our net operating loss carryforwards were lower in fiscal as our german subsidiary generated million pretax income this year compared to a million pretax loss in fiscal results of discontinued operations fiscal compared to fiscal emd 
on june   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our emd business 
we recorded losses of million  or per diluted common share  and million  or per diluted 
table of contents common share  net of income taxes  on discontinued operations in fiscal and  respectively 
the loss in fiscal included million of severance and related costs incurred in preparation of the disposal of the emd business 
there was no discontinued operations activity for emd during fiscal and we paid all of the related severance liabilities for emd as of february  as of february   there was million recorded as current liabilities of discontinued operations emd in the consolidated balance sheet 
see note for further information on the sale of emd and see results of discontinued operations fiscal compared to fiscal included in this item below for more detail on the fiscal emd operations 
pinole point steel 
on may   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our pinole point steel business 
there was no discontinued operations activity for pinole point steel in fiscal compared to income on discontinued operations for pinole of million  net of income taxes  in fiscal the income in fiscal related to the collection of a previously written off receivable 
as of february   there was million in net liabilities remaining compared to million in net liabilities as of february  the remaining net liabilities primarily relate to workers compensation exposure not assumed by the purchasers of pinole point steel  grupo imsa sa de sa since the completion of the sale  pinole point steel has been reported as a discontinued operation 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal in thousands fav unfav variance net sales gross profit of net sales selling  general and administrative of net sales net sales for the year ended february  improved  to million  from million in fiscal this increase was a result of the introduction of new quiet steel applications in the body panel laminate market and a change in the pricing model of the gas tank business as discussed under sales below 
gross profit decreased to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal due primarily to increased energy costs  increased returns and allowances related to quality issues and decreased scrap sales see gross profit below 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses of million were of net sales in fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales in fiscal see sg a expenses 
as noted above  during the first quarter of fiscal  we began reporting sales under two types of applications  acoustical and coated  to better reflect our business mix 
sales of electronic products  which were reported separately in prior years  are reported as acoustical sales when sold for disk drive applications and as coated sales when sold for all other electronic applications 
we also reclassified million and million of other sales in fiscal and  respectively  from acoustical applications to coated applications to more accurately reflect a certain product s application 
significant changes in certain markets within each application are discussed in the following commentary about sales fluctuations 
our commentary does not necessarily reflect the fluctuations of all markets within each application  only those markets considered to have a significant impact on sales during the periods discussed 
net sales 
in thousands net sales application fiscal fiscal variance variance acoustical coated total sales of acoustical materials  which are primarily to automotive and disk drive manufacturers  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales of body panel laminate increased over  from million to million  as quiet steel was introduced into new vehicle 
table of contents models and the unit volume of existing models increased during the fiscal year 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in disk drive sales  from million to million  due to the shift of our supply model for the hard disk drive market to a toll processing program whereby the cost of metal is no longer reflected in the sales price 
this change in the supply model reduced sales in fiscal by million from their fiscal amounts 
coated materials sales increased in fiscal to million from million in the prior year  primarily due to an increase in gas tank sales partially offset by lower sales of electrogalvanized materials and building products  as well as the closing of our middletown  ohio facility in the summer of fiscal the increase in gas tank sales  from million to million  is principally due to a change in the pricing model to a package basis from a toll basis whereby the cost of metal is now included in the sales price 
the inclusion of the metal cost in the sales price increased sales by million in fiscal the decrease in electrogalvanized sales  from million to million  is primarily due to the loss of a customer who exited this market 
the decrease in building product sales  from million to million  was primarily due to lower overall customer demand in this market and the decision not to renew a contract for the production of a low margin product 
sales of coated metal materials were also reduced by million due to the closing of our middletown  ohio facility in the summer of fiscal gross profit 
our gross profit margin was  or million  in fiscal as compared to  or million  in the prior year 
although sales have increased  the gross profit dollars and the gross profit margin percentage have decreased 
changes in the product mix and sales volume have increased gross profit dollars by million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to sales of body panel laminate  but the increase was more than offset by the factors that follow 
gross profit in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was negatively affected by an increase in returns and allowances related to quality issues of million  an increase in quality issues related to inventory of million  a decrease in scrap sales of million due to lower scrap prices and an increase in energy costs of million 
the increase in returns and allowances related to quality issues was primarily due to manufacturing issues that arose during the production of new products  especially in the appliance market 
these issues were corrected during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal we were able to reduce fixed production costs  mainly associated with wages  incentives and health care costs  by million in fiscal we continued to make progress on our operational improvement plan that included stronger supply chain management  six sigma and lean manufacturing to help offset the margin effects noted above 
sg a expenses 
sg a expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in these expenses was primarily due to million in long term stock incentives related to phantom stock units granted in fiscal that did not repeat in fiscal see liquidity and capital resources section below for more information 
the continuing audit and assessment costs in complying with the rules and regulations related to section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal total other income expense  net 
total other income  net  was million in fiscal compared to expense of million in fiscal the improvement was primarily due to the loss on early retirement of debt of million in fiscal see note entitled indebtedness for more details 
we were also able to generate million in interest income  net in fiscal compared to million in interest expense  net in fiscal as we had no outstanding debt during much of fiscal equity in results of joint venture was income of million in both fiscal and see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled joint venture and partnership 
income taxes 
our effective income tax provision rate for continuing operations was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the variance in the effective tax rate compared to the statutory rate for both fiscal and was due to valuation allowances for net operating losses particularly related to our foreign subsidiary in germany  state income taxes including the effect of a change in ohio tax law in the second quarter of fiscal and other permanent differences between book and tax income 
results of discontinued operations fiscal compared to fiscal emd 
on june   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our emd business 
we recorded losses of million  or per diluted common share  and million  or per diluted 
table of contents common share  net of income taxes  on discontinued operations in fiscal and  respectively 
the loss in fiscal included million of severance and related costs incurred in preparation of the disposal of the emd business 
we paid million of the severance and severance related costs as of february  the remaining million was recorded as current liabilities of discontinued operations emd in the consolidated balance sheet 
we also recorded a loss on the sale of emd of million  or per diluted common share  net of income taxes  in the second quarter of fiscal see note for further information on the sale of emd 
the following table shows the results of operations for emd in fiscal and in thousands net sales gross profit sg a and other expenses loss before income taxes benefit for income taxes loss on discontinued operations emd pinole point steel 
on may   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our pinole point steel business 
in fiscal we recorded income on discontinued operations of million  net of income taxes  compared to a loss on discontinued operations of million  net of taxes  in fiscal the income in fiscal related to the collection of a previously written off receivable 
as of february   there was million in net liabilities remaining compared to million in net liabilities as of february  the remaining net liabilities primarily relate to workers compensation exposure not assumed by the purchasers of pinole point steel  grupo imsa sa de sa since the completion of the sale  pinole point steel has been reported as a discontinued operation 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations with funds generated from operating activities  borrowings under credit facilities and long term debt instruments and sales of various assets 
we believe that our cash on hand and availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our working capital needs 
we generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal the main components of cash generated from operating activities consisted of net income plus depreciation  amortization and accretion and increased accounts payable amounts partially offset by a significant increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable was due to transactions with one major customer for whom we manufacture products using their material 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we applied offsetting accounts receivable and accounts payable for this customer  reducing both by million 
we generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal primarily due to net income plus depreciation  amortization and accretion partially offset by a significant decrease in accrued expenses related to incentive compensation that was paid out 
we generated million in cash from operating activities in fiscal in fiscal  we invested million in capital improvement projects compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to the expenditures related to the completion of the application research center in michigan  the expansion of the application development center in europe and improvements in our laminating lines 
the fiscal amount includes million in capital improvements that were reflected in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet at february  the consolidated balance sheet at february  included million in capital improvements reflected in accounts payable that are reported as non cash transactions 
fiscal capital expenditures are projected to be approximately million in addition to those amounts in accounts payable at february  we have a million committed line of credit the line that expires on october  we expect to negotiate a new line of credit in anticipation of the expiration of the current line 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the line as of february  or borrowing capacity reserved for our outstanding letters of credit was million  and the amount remaining available to be borrowed was million as of february  at our option  interest is at the bank s prime rate and as of february  and  respectively or at libor plus a margin based on the ratio of funded debt to ebitda as defined in the agreement 
the financial covenants include a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to  a maximum leverage ratio to  and minimum 
table of contents net worth of million plus of positive consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter ending on or after may   or million  as of february  as of february   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
under the line  there are restrictions on our use of cash and cash equivalents related to repurchases of stock  dividends and acquisitions 
the line is secured by specific personal property including receivables  inventory and property  plant and equipment of the company 
in february  our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program whereby we may repurchase up to one million shares of our common stock 
in fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock on the open market for million under this program 
we continually review the potential for investments in our growth markets 
in addition  we also review the potential value to shareowners of divesting facilities or other assets that are not performing to our expectations 
we are a party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business 
these legal actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire business 
we believe that the resolution of these legal actions will not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
see legal proceedings and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled contingencies 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes the contractual obligations we have outstanding as of february  in thousands 
contractual obligations obligations due in total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total other long term liabilities represent the expected payments for the company s obligations for pension and other post retirement benefits 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of february  other than the operating leases presented in the table of contractual obligations 
inflation we believe that general inflation has not had a significant impact on fiscal  and results of operations 
however  as explained earlier in this item  we have experienced increased costs for both raw materials and energy which has had a negative impact on the gross profit in fiscal and critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are presented within the notes to the consolidated financial statements see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled summary of significant accounting policies included elsewhere in this form k 
while all of the significant accounting policies affect our consolidated financial statements  some of the policies may be viewed to be critical 
these policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of judgments and estimates form the basis for making judgments about our value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of goods to customers  at which time title our value added content in the case of toll processing and risk of loss pass to the customer 
we record shipping and handling billed to a customer in a sales transaction as revenue 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales 
volume discounts due customers are recognized as earned and reported as reductions of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
our revenue recognition policies comply with the criteria set forth in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we also record reductions to revenue for credits issued to customers resulting 
table of contents from manufacturing claims for product defects based upon historical experience and upon specific claims issues as they arise 
any differences between these estimates and our actual costs are recorded on a monthly basis and are reflected in the historical experience prospectively 
we had claims reserves of million as of february  including both general reserves and specifically identified reserves 
a increase in our manufacturing claims experience would have the effect of increasing the claims lag reserve by million 
inventory 
we carry inventory at the lower of cost or market  using either the specific identification  average cost  or first in  first out method of cost valuation 
obsolete  damaged and excessive inventories are carried at net realizable value 
historical recovery rates  current market conditions  inventory receipt date and sales plans are key factors used in the assessment of the net realizable value of obsolete  damaged and excess inventory 
we evaluate these factors on an interim basis and we record adjustments as appropriate to reflect necessary write downs 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the determination of the recoverability of inventory which may affect our future financial statements as we re evaluate the recoverable amounts during each interim period 
we had inventory reserves of million as of february   net of scrap inventory that can be sold on the secondary market 
long lived assets 
long lived assets consist of property  plant and equipment and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based on projections of cash flows on a non discounted basis 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference 
fair value is determined based on market quotes  if available  or is based on valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows 
the valuation techniques utilize certain assumptions we made including  but not limited to  estimated fair market value of assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as public market data  depreciation factors for orderly liquidation  including allowances such as dismantlement and removal  and the relationship between replacement cost new and market value based on the age of the assets 
we own an idled coil coating facility in middletown  ohio with long lived assets that have a carrying value of million as of february  we are considering various options regarding the disposition of this facility and the related equipment including selling  leasing or moving to a new location 
we had these long lived assets appraised during fiscal and  based on that appraisal and our knowledge of the coil coating industry  we believe that no write down of these assets is warranted at this time 
we have a subsidiary in germany that had been operating in a loss position until fiscal the carrying value of the subsidiary s long lived assets was million as of february  the sales of the german subsidiary were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the pretax income loss on continuing operations was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  we internally realigned the sales and expenses related to our strategic alliance with arcelor mittal based on our transfer pricing policy 
accordingly  our domestic corporate operation will collect all related sales and pay our german subsidiary for all routine support services at cost plus a reasonable profit 
in fiscal  our domestic corporate operation was charged million  net of royalties collected  by our german subsidiary 
we believe  based on current projections  that the operations will generate future cash flows sufficient to support the carrying value of the long lived assets 
consequently  no write down of these assets is necessary at this time 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the actual current tax exposure state  federal and foreign  together with assessing permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing bases and treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as the carrying value of intangibles  deductibility of expenses  depreciation of property and equipment  and valuation of inventories 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
the assessment considers several factors  including an estimate of the likelihood that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future years in which temporary differences reverse in the jurisdiction to which the deferred tax asset relates 
this evaluation is primarily based on our historical earnings  projected operating results  applicable net operating loss carryforward expiration dates and identified actions under our control in realizing the associated carryforward benefits 
actual results could differ from this assessment if sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods 
to the extent we determine the need to establish a valuation allowance or increase such valuation allowance  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents we had million of gross deferred tax assets as of february   resulting from net operating loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences  which may reduce taxable income in future periods to the extent we generate profits 
these assets relate to federal  state and foreign tax jurisdictions 
we would have to generate taxable income in the jurisdiction in which the deferred tax asset exists in order to utilize these assets 
the valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets is million as of february  included in these amounts is a million deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences incurred by our german subsidiary and an offsetting valuation allowance of million 
these amounts also include foreign translation adjustments 
our german subsidiary incurred operating losses since commencing business in fiscal until earning a million pretax profit in fiscal we will continue to evaluate the amount and need for this and any other valuation allowances based on historical earnings  projected operating results and other factors described above 
we periodically estimate the probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business 
the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits  as well as changes to or further interpretations of regulations 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that the tax rate may increase or decrease in any period 
amounts accrued for tax liabilities due to the potential change in judgments and estimates are million at february  retirement plans 
the plan obligations and related assets of defined benefit retirement plans including the non contributory supplemental pension plans for some of our officers and other postretirement health care plans are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements entitled retirement plans 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by consulting actuaries using a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate at which the obligation could be effectively settled and the anticipated rate of future salary increases 
key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate  the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets 
to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts  results could be adversely affected 
a one percentage point increase in the estimated discount rate would decrease the net pension expense by less than million and decrease the estimated pension liability by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the net pension expense by less than million and increase the estimated pension liability by million 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the estimated future return on plan assets would have a million relative effect on fiscal net pension expense 
the estimated future return on plan assets for the fiscal pension benefit income calculation is 
environmental reserves 
we are a party to various legal proceedings in connection with the remediation of certain environmental matters 
we record these environmental reserves based upon historical experience and the extent of relevant information available from various third parties 
there are a number of assumptions that are made  including  without limitation  the estimated extent of the environmental damage to any particular site  the available methods of remedy  the contribution expected from various other potentially responsible parties and the discretionary authority of federal and state regulatory authorities in bringing enforcement actions 
we believe our range of exposure for these proceedings and known sites is million to million and as of february   has approximately million in its environmental reserves 
accounting pronouncements effective march   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 which requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage  to be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  it requires that allocation of fixed production overhead costs to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facility 
the adoption of this standard had no material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
effective march   we adopted sfas no
