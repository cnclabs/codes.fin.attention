we may not be able to continue to meet our customers demands for our products and services 
we must continue to meet our customers demand for our products and services 
however  we may not be successful in doing so 
if our customers demand for our products and or services exceeds our ability to meet that demand  we may be unable to continue to provide our customers with the products and or services they require to meet their business needs 
factors that could result in our inability to meet customer demands include an unforeseen spike in demand for our products and or services  a failure by one or more of our suppliers to supply us with the raw materials and other resources that we need to operate our business effectively or poor management of our company or one or more divisions or units of our company  among other factors 
our ability to provide our customers with products and services in a reliable and timely manner  in the quantity and quality desired and with a high level of customer service  may be severely diminished as a result 
if this happens  we may lose some or all of our customers to one or more of our competitors  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
in addition  it is important that we continue to meet our customers demands in the truck components industry for product innovation  improvement and enhancement  including the continued development of new generation products  design improvements and innovations that improve the quality and efficiency of our products 
developing product innovations for the truck components industry has been and will continue to be a significant part of our strategy 
however  such development will require us to continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing 
in the future  we may not have sufficient resources to make such necessary investments  or we may be unable to make the technological advances necessary to carry out product innovations sufficient to meet our customers demands 
we are also subject to the risks generally associated with product development  including lack of market acceptance  delays in product development and failure of products to operate properly 
we may  as a result of these factors  be unable to meaningfully focus on product innovation as a strategy and may therefore be unable to meet our customers demand for product innovation 
equipment failures  delays in deliveries or catastrophic loss at any of our facilities could lead to production or service curtailments or shutdowns 
we manufacture our products at facilities and provide logistical services at our just in time sequencing facilities in the united states 
an interruption in production or service capabilities at any of these facilities as a result of equipment failure or other reasons could result in our inability to produce our products  which would reduce our net sales and earnings for the affected period 
in the event of a stoppage in production at any of our facilities  even if only temporary  or if we experience delays as a result of events that are beyond our control  delivery times to our customers could be severely affected 
any significant delay in deliveries to our customers could lead to increased returns or cancellations and cause us to lose future sales 
our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires  explosions or violent weather conditions 
we may experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of equipment failure  delays in deliveries or catastrophic loss  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may incur potential product liability  warranty and product recall costs 
we are subject to the risk of exposure to product liability  warranty and product recall claims in the event any of our products results in property damage  personal injury or death  or does not conform to specifications 
we may not be able to continue to maintain suitable and adequate insurance in excess of our self insured amounts on acceptable terms that will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities 
in addition  if any of our products proves to be defective  we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage  if any  or a requirement to participate in any product recall  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
work stoppages or other labor issues at our facilities or at our customers facilities could adversely affect our operations 
as of december   unions represented approximately of our workforce 
as a result  we are subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters 
any prolonged strike or other work stoppage at any one of our principal unionized facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we have collective bargaining agreements with different unions at various facilities 
these collective bargaining agreements expire at various times over the next few years  with the exception of our union contract at our monterrey  mexico facility  which expires on an annual basis 
the negotiations in monterrey were successfully completed prior to the expiration of our union contract 
there are five other contracts expiring in three contracts expire on july  two of these expiring contracts are at brillion iron works  brillion  wisconsin  where the majority of the hourly employees are represented by the steelworkers and the remaining employees are represented by the machinists 
the third contract that expires on july   is with the teamsters who represent gunite s hourly employees at its plant facility in elkhart  indiana 
on august   the uaw contract expires at our aluminum wheel plant in erie  pennsylvania 
on november   another uaw contract expires at gunite s plant in rockford  illinois 
any failure by us to reach a new agreement upon expiration of a union contract may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
in addition  if any of our customers experience a material work stoppage  that customer may halt or limit the purchase of our products 
this could cause us to shut down production facilities relating to these products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we are subject to a number of environmental rules and regulations that may require us to make substantial expenditures 
our operations  facilities  and properties are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations pertaining to air emissions  wastewater discharges  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes  the investigation and remediation of contamination  and otherwise relating to health  safety  and the protection of the environment and natural resources 
as a result  we are involved from time to time in administrative or legal proceedings relating to environmental  health and safety matters  and have in the past incurred and will continue to incur capital costs and other expenditures relating to such matters 
in addition to environmental laws that regulate our subsidiaries ongoing operations  our subsidiaries are also subject to environmental remediation liability 
under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  or cercla  and analogous state laws  our subsidiaries may be liable as a result of the release or threatened release of hazardous materials into the environment 
our subsidiaries are currently involved in several matters relating to the investigation and or remediation of locations where they have arranged for the disposal of foundry and other wastes 
such matters include situations in which we have been named or are believed to be potentially responsible parties under cercla or state or local laws in connection with the contamination of these sites 
additionally  environmental remediation may be required to address soil and groundwater contamination identified at certain facilities 
as of december   we had an environmental reserve of approximately million  related primarily to tti s foundry operations 
this reserve is based on current cost estimates and does not reduce estimated expenditures to net present value  but does take into account the benefit of a contractual indemnity given to us by a prior owner of our wheel end subsidiary 
the failure of the indemnitor to fulfill its obligations could result in future costs that may be material 
any cash expenditures required by us or our subsidiaries to comply with applicable environmental laws and or to pay for any remediation efforts will not be reduced or otherwise affected by the existence of the environmental reserve 
our environmental reserve may not be adequate to cover our future costs related to the sites associated with the environmental reserve  and any additional costs may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the discovery of additional sites  the modification of existing or the promulgation of new laws or regulations  more vigorous enforcement by regulators  the imposition of joint and several liability under cercla or analogous state laws  or other unanticipated events could also result in such a material adverse effect 
the final iron and steel foundry national emission standard for hazardous air pollutants  or neshap  was developed pursuant to section d of the clean air act and requires all major sources of hazardous air pollutants to install controls representative of maximum achievable control technology 
we are evaluating the applicability of the iron and steel foundry neshap to our foundry operations 
if applicable  compliance with the iron and steel foundry neshap may result in future significant capital costs  which we currently expect to be approximately million in total during the period through see item business environmental matters 
we might fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  or third parties might assert that our technologies infringe on their intellectual property 
the protection of our intellectual property is important to our business 
we rely on a combination of trademarks  copyrights  patents  and trade secrets to provide protection in this regard  but this protection might be inadequate 
for example  our pending or future trademark  copyright  and patent applications might not be approved or  if allowed  they might not be of sufficient strength or scope 
conversely  third parties might assert that our technologies or other intellectual property infringe on their proprietary rights 
although we have not had litigation with respect to such matters in the past  litigation  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts  might be necessary  and whether or not we are ultimately successful  the litigation could adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
see item business intellectual property 
litigation against us could be costly and time consuming to defend 
we are regularly subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business  such as workers compensation claims  osha investigations  employment disputes  unfair labor practice charges  customer and supplier disputes  and product liability claims arising out of the conduct of our business 
litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
if we fail to retain our executive officers  our business could be harmed 
our success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers  who have collectively been employees of either accuride or tti for over years 
their skills  experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us 
the loss of any one of them  in particular mr 
keating  our chairman and chief executive officer  who joined accuride in december  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
all of our employees are at will 
our future success will also depend in part upon our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
although we do not presently anticipate terminating any senior management employees  certain senior management employees have entered into potentially costly severance arrangements with us 
severance and retention agreements with certain senior management employees provide that the participating executive is entitled to a regular severance payment if the company terminates the participating executive s employment without cause or if the participating executive terminates his or her employment with the company for good reason as these terms are defined in the agreement at any time other than during a protection period 
the protection period begins on the date on which a change in control as defined in the agreement occurs and ends months after a change in control 
the regular severance benefit is equal to the participating executive s base salary for one year 
as of december   in the event we terminated messrs 
keating  murphy  armstrong  taylor  nida  and donatelli or ms 
hamme  we would have to make cash payments of       and  respectively 
see item directors and executive officers of the registrant 
in addition  each participating executive is entitled to a change in control severance benefit if his or her employment with the company is terminated during the protection period either by the participating executive for good reason or by the company without cause 
the change in control severance benefits for tier i executives messrs 
keating and murphy consist of a payment equal to of the executive s salary at termination  plus of the greater of i the annualized incentive compensation to which the executive would be entitled as of the date on which the change of control occurs or ii the average incentive compensation award over the three years prior to termination 
the change in control severance benefits for tier ii executives messrs 
armstrong  taylor  nida and donatelli and ms 
hamme consist of a payment equal to of the executive s salary plus of the greater of i the annualized incentive compensation to which the executive would be entitled as of the date on which the change of control occurs or ii the average incentive compensation award over the three years prior to termination 
the change in control severance benefits for tier iii executives other key executives consist of a payment equal to of the executive s salary and of the greater of i the annualized incentive compensation to which the executive would be entitled as of the date on which the change of control occurs or ii the average incentive compensation award over the three years prior to termination 
if the participating executive s termination occurs during the protection period  the severance and retention agreement also provides for the continuance of certain other benefits  including reimbursement for forfeitures under qualified plans and continued health  disability  accident and dental insurance coverage for the lesser of months or months in the case of tier iii executives from the date of termination or the date on which the executive receives such benefits from a subsequent employer 
tier i executives are entitled to a modified tax gross up 
neither the regular severance benefit nor the change in control severance benefit is payable if the company terminates the participating executive s employment for cause  if the executive voluntarily terminates his or her employment without good reason or if the executive s employment is terminated as a result of disability or death 
any payments to which the participating executive may be entitled under the agreement will be reduced by the full amount of any payments to which the executive may be entitled due to termination under any other severance policy offered by the company 
these agreements would make it costly for us to terminate certain of our senior management employees and such costs may also discourage potential acquisition proposals  which may negatively affect our stock price 
our products may be rendered obsolete or less attractive by changes in regulatory  legislative or industry requirements 
changes in regulatory  legislative or industry requirements may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive 
our ability to anticipate changes in these requirements  especially changes in regulatory standards  will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive 
we may not be able to comply in the future with new regulatory  legislative and or industrial standards that may be necessary for us to remain competitive or that certain of our products will not  as a result  become obsolete or less attractive to our customers 
other risks related to our business our substantial leverage and significant debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition or our ability to fulfill our obligations and make it more difficult for us to fund our operations 
at december   total indebtedness was million 
our substantial level of indebtedness could have important negative consequences to you and us  including we may have difficulty satisfying our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  we may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes  we will need to use a substantial portion of our available cash flow to pay interest and principal on our debt  which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations and other business activities  our debt level increases our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions  our debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and in our industry in general  our leverage could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  we may not have sufficient funds available  and our debt level may restrict us from raising the funds necessary  to repurchase all of our new senior subordinated notes tendered to us upon the occurrence of a change of control  which would constitute an event of default under the new senior subordinated notes  and our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments which  among other things  require us to maintain specified financial ratios and limit our ability to incur debt and sell assets  could result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
you should also be aware that certain of our borrowings are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest  which exposes us to the risk of increasing interest rates 
as of december   the carrying value of our total debt was million  of which million  or approximately  was subject to variable interest rates 
however  as of december   interest rate swaps of million were outstanding 
under the terms of the interest rate swaps  we agreed with the counterparty to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between from march through march  from march through march  and from march through march  and the variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the notional principal amount 
the interest rate swaps commenced in february and mature in march if interest rates increase  our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same 
see item selected consolidated financial data 
despite our substantial leverage  our subsidiaries and we will be able to incur more indebtedness 
this could further exacerbate the risk immediately described above  including our ability to service our indebtedness 
our subsidiaries and we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
although our senior credit facilities and the indenture governing our new senior subordinated notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  such restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions  and under certain circumstances indebtedness incurred in compliance with such restrictions could be substantial 
for example  we may incur additional debt to  among other things  finance future acquisitions  expand through internal growth  fund our working capital needs  comply with regulatory requirements  respond to competition or for general financial reasons alone 
as of december   the revolving credit facility under our senior credit facility provides for additional borrowings of up to million under our us facility and million under our canadian revolving credit facility 
to the extent new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries current debt levels  the risk immediately described above would increase 
to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  and other factors that are beyond our control 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations 
our currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements may not be realized on schedule 
also  future borrowings may not be available to us under our credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell material assets or operations  obtain additional equity capital or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness 
in the absence of such operating results and resources  we could face substantial cash flow problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations 
we cannot assure you as to the timing of such asset sales or the proceeds which we could realize from such sales and that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  including our senior credit facilities and senior subordinated notes  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we are subject to a number of restrictive covenants  which  if breached  may restrict our business and financing activities 
our senior credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes impose  and the terms of any future indebtedness may impose  operating and other restrictions on us 
such restrictions will affect  and in many respects limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends and make distributions  issue stock of subsidiaries  make certain investments  repurchase stock  create liens  enter into affiliate transactions  enter into sale leaseback transactions  merge or consolidate  and transfer and sell assets 
in addition  our new senior credit facilities include other more restrictive covenants and prohibit us from prepaying our other indebtedness  including our new senior subordinated notes  while borrowings under our new senior credit facilities are outstanding 
our new senior credit facilities also require us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios 
our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 
if we are unable to comply with the restrictions contained in the credit facilities  the lenders could declare all borrowings outstanding  together with accrued and unpaid interest  to be immediately due and payable  require us to apply all of our available cash to repay the borrowings  or prevent us from making debt service payments on the senior subordinated notes  any of which would result in an event of default under our new senior subordinated notes 
if we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings when due  our lenders could sell the collateral securing our new senior credit facilities  which constitutes substantially all of our and our subsidiaries assets 
although holders of our senior subordinated notes could accelerate the notes upon the acceleration of the obligations under our credit facilities  we may not have sufficient assets remaining after we have paid all the borrowings under our senior credit facilities  and any other senior debt  to repay the senior subordinated notes

item legal proceedings neither accuride nor any of our subsidiaries is a party to any legal proceeding which  in the opinion of management  would have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition

we establish reserves for matters in which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
while we believe that we have established adequate accruals for our expected future liability with respect to our pending legal actions and proceedings  we cannot assure you that our liability with respect to any such action or proceeding would not exceed our established accruals

see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources and liquidity 
any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon then existing conditions  including our financial condition and results of operations  capital requirements  contractual restrictions  business prospects and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant

we believe that substantially all heavy duty truck models manufactured in north america contain one or more accuride components 
our diversified customer base includes substantially all of the leading commercial vehicle oems  such as freightliner corporation  with its freightliner  sterling and western star brand trucks  paccar  inc  with its peterbilt and kenworth brand trucks  international truck and engine corporation  with its international brand trucks  and volvo truck corporation  or volvo mack  with its volvo and mack brand trucks 
our primary commercial trailer customers include leading commercial trailer oems  such as great dane limited partnership and wabash national  inc our major light truck customer is general motors corporation 
our product portfolio is supported by strong sales  marketing and design engineering capabilities and is manufactured in strategically located  technologically advanced facilities across the united states  mexico and canada 
business outlook following a three year industry downturn  the heavy and medium duty truck and commercial trailer markets began to show signs of a cyclical recovery at the end of  which continued to strengthen through freight growth  improved fleet profitability  equipment age  equipment utilization  and economic strength continue to drive order rates for new vehicles not seen in several years 
the heavy and medium duty truck and commercial trailer markets and the related aftermarket are the primary drivers of our sales 
these markets are  in turn  directly influenced by conditions in the north american truck industry generally and by overall economic growth and consumer spending 
current industry forecasts by analysts  including america s commercial transportation publications  or act  predict that the north american truck industry will experience a significant decline in due to emissions standards changes that became effective in delayed or failed economic recovery could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
our operating challenges are to meet these varying levels of production while improving our internal productivity  and at the same time  mitigate the margin pressure from rising material prices 
furthermore  as commercial vehicle build volumes increase  we are required to increase our level of outsourced production for some of our products due to production constraints  and such outsourcing typically results in lower margins 
additionally  new us federal truck emissions regulations took effect in and are expected to result in cleaner operating  yet more costly  trucks 
as a result  some of our customers altered their traditional buying trends  which resulted in higher than normal demand in late  which we expect will be followed by a period of reduced demand in tti merger on january   pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of merger  a wholly owned subsidiary of accuride was merged with and into tti  resulting in tti becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of accuride  which we refer to as the tti merger 
upon consummation of the tti merger  the stockholders of accuride prior to consummation of the tti merger owned of the common stock of the combined company and the former stockholders of tti owned of the common stock of the combined company 
in connection with the tti merger we sold million in aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due  which we refer to as our new senior subordinated notes in a private placement transaction and subsequently exchanged such notes with substantially equivalent notes that were registered pursuant to a registration statement on form s filed with the sec on may   we entered into senior secured credit facilities  consisting of a million term loan credit facility and a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of million  which is comprised of a new million us revolving credit facility and the continuation of a million canadian revolving credit facility 
neither revolving credit facility was funded as of december   we discharged all of accuride s outstanding senior subordinated notes due  including accrued interest and a redemption premium  we discharged all of tti s outstanding senior subordinated notes due  including accrued interest and a redemption premium  we repaid substantially all existing senior secured indebtedness of accuride and tti  including accrued interest and redemption premiums  and we paid approximately million of transaction fees and expenses 
accuride has rationalized costs by eliminating redundant corporate overhead expenses  and consolidating purchasing  research and development  information technology and sales and distribution functions 
we completed the initial public offering of million shares of our common stock on april   and our common stock now trades on the new york stock exchange under the symbol acw 
we used the net proceeds of approximately million from the ipo and other available cash of million to repay a portion of our credit facility

as a result of the resolution  the gain contingency of million recorded as a liability during the third quarter of was eliminated  the company recognized million of revenue in  and anticipates recognition of an additional million of revenue in the first half of in addition  cash flow increased by million in and we anticipate an increase of million in the second half of we anticipate that ford will re source its accuride business to another supplier during in  total sales to ford were less than of total revenues

restrictive debt covenants 
our credit documents contain numerous financial and operating covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters 
these covenants place significant restrictions on  among other things  the ability to incur additional debt  to pay dividends  to create liens  to make certain payments and investments and to sell or otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with other entities 
accuride is also required to meet certain financial ratios and tests including a leverage ratio  an interest coverage ratio  and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
a failure to comply with the obligations contained in the credit documents could result in an event of default  and possibly the acceleration of the related debt and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing indebtedness that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at december  senior subordinated notes 
in january we issued the million notes pursuant to an indenture the indenture 
the indenture was limited in aggregate principal amount to million  of which million were issued as private notes and subsequently exchanged for exchange notes  which exchange had been registered under the securities act of  as amended 
the indenture provided certain restrictions on the payment of dividends by accuride 
the indenture was subject to and governed by the trust indenture act of  as amended 
the notes were general unsecured obligations of accuride and were subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness as defined in the indenture 
the notes were to mature on february  interest on the notes accrues at the rate of per annum and was due and payable semi annually in arrears on february and august  commencing on august   to holders of record of the notes on the immediately preceding january and july as discussed above  these notes were repaid january   in connection with the acquisition of tti 
effective january   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due in a private placement transaction 
interest on the senior subordinated notes is payable on february and august of each year  beginning on august  the notes mature on february  and may be redeemed  at our option  in whole or in part  at any time on or before february  in cash at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture  plus interest 
in addition  on or before february   we may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of notes issued under the indenture with the proceeds of certain equity offerings 
the notes will be general unsecured obligations of the company ranking senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the company 
the notes are subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness of the company including indebtedness incurred under the companies new credit agreement 
in may  we successfully completed an exchange offer as required per the terms of the registration rights agreement we entered into with the initial purchasers in connection with the issuance of our senior subordinated notes 
pursuant to an effective exchange offer registration statement filed with the sec  holders of our outstanding unregistered senior subordinated notes due exchanged such notes for otherwise identical senior subordinated notes due which have been registered under the securities act of  as amended 
off balance sheet arrangements 
our off balance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations which are principally take or pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials  including natural gas  consistent with customary industry practice as well as letters of credit 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  and the effect such obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period dollars in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt interest on long term debt a interest on variable rate debt b capital leases operating leases purchase commitments c other long term liabilities d total obligations a consists of interest payments for accuride s outstanding senior subordinated notes due at a fixed rate of

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses during the reporting periods 
we continually evaluate our accounting policies and estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates made by management 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those where the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
we believe our critical accounting policies and estimates  as reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors  include accounting for impairment of long lived assets  goodwill  pensions  and taxes 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in performing the review of recoverability  we estimate future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and our eventual disposition 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
we consider the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets since the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
on january   we no longer amortize goodwill but instead test annually for impairment as required by sfas no 
if the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets exceeds our fair value  an impairment loss must be recognized 
a present value technique is often the best available technique with which to estimate the fair value of a group of assets 
the use of a present value technique requires the use of estimates of future cash flows 
these cash flow estimates incorporate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value as well as our own assumptions 
these cash flow estimates are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and consider all available evidence 
however  there is inherent uncertainty in estimates of future cash flows and termination values 
as such  several different terminal values were used in our calculations and the likelihood of possible outcomes was considered 
indefinite lived intangibles assets trade names are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
self insurance management judgment is required to estimate our medical insurance and workers compensation liabilities since we are self insured 
we evaluate the trends of claims to determine the appropriate liability and adjust the amount of such liability  if necessary 
although we are self insured  we do use insurance policies to cover claims over a pre determined limit 
pensions and other post employment benefits we account for our defined benefit pension plans and other post employment benefit plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  which require that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we use a smoothed value of plan assets which is further described below 
sfas no 
requires that the effects of the performance of the pension plan s assets and changes in pension liability discount rates on our computation of pension income cost be amortized over future periods 
sfas no 
requires an employer to fully recognize the obligations associated with single employer defined benefit pension  retiree healthcare  and other postretirement plans in their financial statements 
the most significant element in determining our pension income cost in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
in  we assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would be 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income cost 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income cost 
over the long term  our pension plan assets have earned approximately 
the expected return on plan assets is reviewed annually  and if conditions should warrant  will be revised 
if we were to lower this rate  future pension cost would increase 
at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   we determined this rate to be 
changes in discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected pension income cost  and the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  have been deferred  in accordance with sfas no 
declines in the financial markets coupled with the decline in interest rates have caused our accumulated pension obligation to exceed the fair value of the related plan assets 
as a result  in we recorded an increase to our accrued pension liability and a non cash charge to equity of approximately million after tax 
for the year ended december   we recognized consolidated pretax pension cost of million including a million curtailment charge as a result of an event in our london  ontario  facility compared to million in we currently expect that the consolidated pension cost for will be approximately million 
we currently expect to contribute million to our pension plans during  however  we may elect to adjust the level of contributions based on a number of factors  including performance of pension investments  changes in interest rates  and changes in workforce compensation 
for the year ended december   we recognized a consolidated pre tax post retirement welfare benefit cost of million compared to million in we currently expect that the consolidated post retirement welfare benefit cost for will be approximately million 
we expect to pay million during in post retirement welfare benefits 
income taxes management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets  liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against the deferred tax assets 
we evaluate quarterly the realizability of our net deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets 
factors that may affect our ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include  but are not limited to  the following increased competition  a decline in sales or margins  or loss of market share 
we operate in multiple jurisdictions and are routinely under audit by federal  state and international tax authorities 
exposures exist related to various filing positions that may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments by the taxing authorities 
reserves for these potential exposures that have been established represent management s best estimate of the probable adjustments 
on a quarterly basis  management evaluates the reserve amounts in light of any additional information and adjusts the reserve balances as necessary to reflect the best estimate of the probable outcomes 
we believe that we have established the appropriate reserve for these estimated exposures 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
the resolution of these matters in a particular future period could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations and provision for income taxes 
recent developments new accounting pronouncements new accounting standards which could impact us include fin  sfas no 
 and sfas no 
interpretation no 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  to address the noncomparability in reporting tax assets and liabilities resulting from a lack of specific guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  on the uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
specifically  fin prescribes a a consistent recognition threshold and b a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and provides related guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin will apply to fiscal years beginning after december  management estimates that the adoption of fin will reduce retained earnings and increase tax liabilities between approximately million and million 
management is also evaluating the impact to goodwill as a result of the adoption of fin  but the impact has not been determined 
sfas no 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  to eliminate the diversity in practice that exists due to the different definitions of fair value and the limited guidance for applying those definitions in gaap that are dispersed among the many accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements 
sfas no 
will apply to fiscal years beginning after november  management is currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 establishing the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities  to permit all entities to choose to elect to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value 
sfas no 
applies to fiscal years beginning after november   with early adoption permitted for an entity that has also elected to apply the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
an entity is prohibited from retrospectively applying sfas no 
 unless it chooses early adoption 
management is currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on the consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation 
the effects of inflation were not considered material during fiscal years   or item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to the risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates  raw material commodity prices  and interest rates 
we use derivative instruments to manage these exposures 
the objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize the risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures 
foreign currency risk certain forecasted transactions  assets  and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk 
we monitor our foreign currency exposures to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency derivatives 
the principal currency of exposure is the canadian dollar 
from time to time we use foreign currency financial instruments to offset the impact of the variability in exchange rates on our operations  cash flows  assets and liabilities 
at december   we had million of open foreign exchange forward contracts 
a hypothetical adverse change in the canadian exchange rate would not have a material impact 
foreign currency derivative contracts provide only limited protection against currency risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our currency risk management programs include accuracy of sales estimates  volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of derivative instruments 
the counterparty to the foreign exchange contracts is a financial institution with an investment grade credit rating 
the use of forward contracts protects our cash flows against unfavorable movements in exchange rates  to the extent of the amount under contract 
raw material commodity price risk we rely upon the supply of certain raw materials and commodities in our production processes and we have entered into firm purchase commitments for steel  aluminum  and natural gas 
a adverse change in pricing considering production volume would be approximately million  which would be reduced through the terms of the sales  supply  and procurement contracts 
additionally  from time to time  we use commodity price swaps and futures contracts to manage the variability in certain commodity prices on our operations and cash flows 
at december   we had no open commodity price swaps or futures contracts 
interest rate risk we use long term debt as a primary source of capital 
the following table presents the principal cash repayments and related weighted average interest rates by maturity date for our long term debt at december  the weighted average interest rates are based on month libor in effect as of december  dollars in thousands thereafter total fair value long term debt fixed average rate variable average rate we have used interest rate swaps to alter interest rate exposure between fixed and variable rates on a portion of our long term debt 
as of december   interest rate swaps of million were outstanding 
under the terms of the interest rate swaps  we agreed with the counterparty to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between from march through march  from march through march  and from march through march  and the variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the notional principal amount 
the interest rate swaps commenced in february and mature in march a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our statements of operations
