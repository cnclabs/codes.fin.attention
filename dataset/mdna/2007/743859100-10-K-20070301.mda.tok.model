table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial review the principal objective of this financial review is to provide an overview of the financial condition and results of operations of provident bankshares corporation and its subsidiaries for the three years ended december  this discussion and tabular presentations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes as well as the other information herein  particularly the information regarding the corporation s business operations as described in item overview of income and expenses income the corporation has two primary sources of pre tax income 
the first is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income which is the income that the corporation earns on its loans and investments and interest expense which is the interest that is paid on its deposits and borrowings 
the second principal source of pre tax income is non interest income the compensation received from providing products and services 
the majority of the non interest income comes from service charges on deposit accounts 
the corporation also earns income from insurance commissions  mortgage banking fees and other fees and charges 
the corporation recognizes gains or losses as a result of sales of investment securities or the disposition of loans  foreclosed property or fixed assets 
in addition  the corporation also recognizes gains or losses on its outstanding derivative financial instruments 
these gains and losses are not a regular part of the corporation s primary source of income 
expenses the expenses the corporation incurs in operating its business consist of salaries and employee benefits expense  occupancy expense  furniture and equipment expense  external processing fees  deposit insurance premiums  advertising expenses  and other miscellaneous expenses 
salaries and benefits expense consists primarily of the salaries and wages paid to employees  payroll taxes and expenses for health care  retirement and other employee benefits 
occupancy expense  which are fixed or variable costs associated with building and equipment  consist primarily of lease payments  real estate taxes  depreciation charges  maintenance and cost of utilities 
furniture and equipment and external processing include fees paid to third party data processing services and expenses and depreciation charges related to office and banking equipment 
depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using the straight line and accelerated methods based on the useful lives of related assets 
estimated lives range from to years for building and improvements  and to years for furniture and equipment 
other expenses include expenses for attorneys  accountants and consultants  fees paid to directors  franchise taxes  charitable contributions  insurance  office supplies  postage  telephone  merger expense and other miscellaneous operating expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements of the corporation  which are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the reporting periods 
management evaluates estimates on an on going basis  and believes the following represent its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for loan losses  non accrual loans  other real estate owned  estimates of fair value and intangible assets associated with mergers  other than temporary impairment of investment securities  pension and post retirement benefits  asset prepayment rates  goodwill and intangible assets  stock based compensation  derivative financial instruments  recourse liabilities  litigation and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
it is at least reasonably possible that each of the corporation s estimates could change in the near term and the effect of the change could be material to the corporation s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for loan losses  other than temporary impairment of investment securities  derivative financial instruments  goodwill and intangible assets  asset prepayment rates  and income taxes 
each estimate is discussed on pages the financial impact of each estimate  to the extent significant to financial results  is discussed in the applicable sections of management s discussion and analysis 
allowance for loan losses the corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses the allowance  which is intended to be management s best estimate of probable inherent losses in the outstanding loan portfolio 
the allowance is reduced by actual credit losses and is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries of previous losses 
the provisions for loan losses are charges to earnings to bring the total allowance to a level considered necessary by management 
the allowance is based on management s continuing review and evaluation of the loan portfolio 
this process provides an allowance consisting of two components  allocated and unallocated 
to arrive at the allocated component of the allowance  the corporation combines estimates of the allowances needed for loans analyzed individually and on a pooled basis 
the allocated component of the allowance is supplemented by an unallocated component 
the portion of the allowance that is allocated to individual internally criticized and non accrual loans is determined by estimating the inherent loss on each problem credit after giving consideration to the value of underlying collateral 
management emphasizes loan quality and close monitoring of potential problem credits 
credit risk identification and review processes are utilized in order to assess and monitor the degree of risk in the loan portfolio 
the corporation s lending and credit administration staff are charged with reviewing the loan portfolio and identifying changes in the economy or in a borrower s circumstances which may affect the ability to repay debt or the value of pledged collateral 
a loan classification and review system exists that identifies those loans with a higher than normal risk of uncollectibility 
each commercial loan is assigned a grade based upon an assessment of the borrower s financial capacity to service the debt and the presence and value of collateral for the loan 
in addition to being used to categorize risk  the bank s internal ten point risk rating system is used to determine the allocated allowance for the commercial portfolio 
reserve factors  based on the actual loss history for a year period for criticized loans  are assigned 
if the factor  based on loss history for classified credits is lower than the minimum established factor  the higher factor is applied 
for loans with satisfactory risk profiles  the factors are based on the rating profile of the portfolio and the consequent historic losses of bonds with equivalent ratings 
for the consumer portfolios  the determination of the allocated allowance is conducted at an aggregate  or pooled  level 
each quarter  historical rolling loss rates for homogenous pools of loans in these portfolios provide the basis for the allocated reserve 
for any portfolio where the bank lacks sufficient historic experience  industry loss rates are used 
if recent history is not deemed to reflect the inherent losses existing within a portfolio  older historic loss rates during a period of similar economic or market conditions are used 
the bank s credit administration group adjusts the indicated loss rates based on qualitative factors 
factors that are considered in adjusting loss rates include risk characteristics  credit concentration trends and general economic conditions  including job growth and unemployment rates 
for commercial and real estate portfolios  additional factors include the level and trend of watched and criticized credits within those portfolios  commercial real estate vacancy  absorption and rental rates  and the number and volume of syndicated credits  construction loans  or other portfolio segments deemed to carry higher levels of risk 
upon completion of the qualitative adjustments  the overall allowance is allocated to the components of the portfolio based on the adjusted loss factors 
the unallocated component of the allowance exists to mitigate the imprecision inherent in management s estimates of expected credit losses and includes its judgmental determination of the amounts necessary for concentrations  economic uncertainties and other subjective factors that may not have been fully considered in the allocated allowance 
the relationship of the unallocated component to the total allowance may fluctuate from period to period 
although management has allocated the majority of the allowance to specific loan categories  the evaluation of the allowance is considered in its entirety 
lending management meets at least quarterly with executive management to review the credit quality of the loan portfolios and to evaluate the allowance 
the corporation has an internal risk analysis and review staff that continuously reviews loan quality and reports the results of its reviews to executive management and the board of directors 
such reviews also assist management in establishing the level of the allowance 
management believes that it uses relevant information available to make determinations about the allowance and that it has established its existing allowance in accordance with gaap 
if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in 
table of contents making determinations  adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be affected 
because events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that increases to the allowance will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate 
the fdic examines the bank periodically and  accordingly  as part of this examination  the allowance is reviewed for adequacy utilizing specific guidelines 
based upon their review  the regulators may from time to time require reserves in addition to those previously provided 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities securities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline  in addition to the reasons underlying the decline  to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline in value is permanent 
it indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value are not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support fair values equal to  or greater than  the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
derivative financial instruments the corporation uses various derivative financial instruments as part of its interest rate risk management strategy to mitigate the exposure to changes in market interest rates 
the derivative financial instruments used separately or in combination are interest rate swaps  caps and floors 
derivative financial instruments are required to be measured at fair value and recognized as either assets or liabilities in the financial statements 
fair value represents the payment the corporation would receive or pay if the item were sold or bought in a current transaction 
fair values are generally based on market quotes 
the accounting for changes in fair value gains or losses of a derivative is dependent on whether the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 the corporation assigns derivatives to one of these categories at the purchase date fair value hedge  cash flow hedge or non designated derivatives 
sfas no 
requires an assessment of the expected and ongoing hedge effectiveness of any derivative designated a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge 
derivatives are included in other assets and other liabilities in the consolidated statements of condition 
fair value hedges for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  the derivative instrument and related hedged item are marked to market through the related interest income or expense  as applicable  except for the ineffective portion which is recorded in non interest income 
cash flow hedges for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  mark to market adjustments are recorded net of income taxes as a component of other comprehensive income oci in stockholders equity  except for the ineffective portion which is recorded in non interest income 
amounts recorded in oci are recognized into earnings concurrent with the hedged items impact on earnings 
non designated derivatives certain economic hedges are not designated as cash flow or as fair value hedges for accounting purposes 
as a result  changes in the fair value are recorded in non interest income in the consolidated statements of income 
interest income or expense related to non designated derivatives is also recorded in non interest income 
all qualifying relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items are fully documented by the corporation 
risk management objectives  strategies and the projected effectiveness of the chosen derivatives to hedge specific risks are also documented 
at inception of the hedging relationship and periodically as required under sfas no 
 the corporation evaluates the effectiveness of its hedging instruments 
for hedges qualifying for short cut treatment at inception  the ongoing effectiveness testing includes a review of the hedge and the hedged item to determine if the hedge continues to qualify for short cut treatment 
an assumption of no hedge ineffectiveness is allowed for derivatives qualifying for short cut treatment 
for all other derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting  a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of the hedge is required at each reporting date 
the corporation performs effectiveness testing quarterly for all of its hedges 
the corporation uses benchmark interest rates such as libor to hedge the interest rate risk associated with interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities 
using benchmark rates and complying with specific criteria set forth in sfas no  the corporation has concluded that for qualifying hedges  changes in fair value or cash flows that are attributable to risks being hedged will be highly effective at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis 
when it is determined that a derivative is not  or ceases to be effective as a hedge  the corporation discontinues hedge accounting prospectively 
when a fair value hedge is discontinued due to ineffectiveness  the corporation continues to carry the derivative on the consolidated statements of condition at its fair value as a non designated derivative  but discontinues marking to market the 
table of contents hedged asset or liability for changes in fair value 
any previous mark to market adjustments recorded to the hedged item are amortized over the remaining life of the asset or liability 
all ineffective portions of fair value hedges are reported in and affect net income immediately 
when a cash flow hedge is discontinued due to termination of the derivative  the corporation continues to carry the previous mark to market adjustments in accumulated oci and recognizes the amount into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings 
if the cash flow hedge is discontinued due to ineffectiveness  the derivative would be considered a non designated hedge and would continue to be marked to market in the consolidated statements of condition as an asset or liability  in the consolidated statements of income with any changes in the mark to market recorded through current period earnings and not through oci 
counter party credit risk associated with derivatives is controlled by dealing with well established brokers that are highly rated by credit rating agencies and by establishing exposure limits for individual counter parties 
market risk on interest rate swaps is minimized by using these instruments as hedges and by continually monitoring the positions to ensure ongoing effectiveness 
credit risk is controlled by entering into bilateral collateral agreements with brokers  in which the parties pledge collateral to indemnify the counter party in the case of default 
the corporation s hedging activities and strategies are monitored by the bank s asset liability committee alco as part of its oversight of the treasury function 
goodwill and intangible assets for acquisitions  the corporation records the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and liabilities assumed at their fair value  which in many instances involves estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques 
the determination of the useful lives of intangible assets is subjective  as is the appropriate amortization period for such intangible assets 
these estimates also include the establishment of various accruals and allowances based on planned facilities dispositions and employee severance considerations  among other acquisition related items 
in addition  purchase acquisitions typically result in goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired by the corporation 
the corporation tests goodwill annually for impairment 
such tests involve the use of estimates and assumptions 
intangible assets other than goodwill  such as deposit based intangibles which are determined to have finite lives  are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which is approximately years 
asset prepayment rates the corporation purchases amortizing loan pools and investment securities in which the underlying assets are residential mortgage loans subject to prepayments 
the actual principal reduction on these assets varies from the expected contractual principal reduction due to principal prepayments resulting from borrowers elections to refinance the underlying mortgages based on market and other conditions 
prepayment rate projections utilize actual prepayment speed experience and available market information on like kind instruments 
the prepayment rates form the basis for income recognition of premiums or discounts on the related assets 
changes in prepayment estimates may cause the earnings recognized on these assets to vary over the term that the assets are held  creating volatility in the net interest margin 
prepayment rate assumptions are monitored and updated monthly to reflect actual activity and the most recent market projections 
income taxes the corporation accounts for income taxes under the asset liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when in the judgment of management  it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not become realizable 
it is at least reasonably possible that management s judgment about the need for a valuation allowance for deferred taxes could change in the near term 
financial condition the financial condition of the corporation reflects the continued improvement in financial fundamentals through the consistent execution of the bank s strategic priorities and strengthening the balance sheet by growing loans and deposits in the bank s core business segments and key major markets of greater baltimore  greater washington and central virginia 
strong growth in relationship based loan portfolios loans other than the corporation s originated and acquired residential mortgage loans was financed by proceeds from payments and maturities in the bank s wholesale assets originated and acquired residential mortgages and investment securities 
the expanded market presence the corporation has experienced over the past few years has been successful in helping to grow and deepen customer relationships 
these successful efforts have led to growth in average relationship based loans of million  or  and average deposits of million  or  over at december   total assets were billion  while total loans and deposits were billion and billion  respectively 

table of contents over the past months  strong growth in internally generated loan portfolios has replaced the decline in wholesale assets originated and acquired residential mortgages and investment securities as the corporation continues to execute its strategy of strengthening the balance sheet by growing relationship based portfolios and de emphasizing wholesale assets 
in addition  capital growth has been a specific focus for the corporation 
tangible common equity as a percentage of tangible assets has grown to for the year ending december  compared to at december  tangible common equity ratio is a non gaap measure used to determine capital adequacy 
tangible common equity is total equity less net accumulated other comprehensive income  goodwill and deposit based intangibles 
tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and deposit based intangibles 
management and many stock analysts use the tangible common equity ratio in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets  typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method accounting for mergers and acquisitions 
earning assets total average earning asset balances of billion in remained consistent to the corporation s average asset levels in the following table summarizes the composition of the bank s average earning assets for the periods indicated 
average earning assets year ended december  dollars in thousands variance variance investments other earning assets residential real estate originated and acqured residential mortgage home equity other consumer marine other total consumer commercial real estate commercial mortgage residential construction commercial construction commercial business total commercial total loans total average earning assets total average loan balances increased to billion in  an increase of million  or  from excluding originated and acquired residential mortgages  relationship based loans increased million or 
strong growth in the greater baltimore region  mainly in commercial loans  made up of the increase in relationship based loans 
the average loan growth of million is comprised of million  or  in commercial loans offset by a decline of million  or  in consumer loans 
the decline in consumer loans included the planned reductions in originated and acquired residential mortgages of million 
at december   there is a balanced mix of revenue sources between the two product segments with billion  or  in commercial loans and billion  or  in consumer loans 
commercial banking  which is a key component to the corporation s regional presence in its market area  grew million  or  over residential and commercial construction loans posted increases during the year of million and million  respectively  reflecting the strong regional demand for construction loans in the bank s markets 
in addition  commercial business grew by million  or  while commercial mortgages decreased million  or 
the decline in average consumer loans of million included the planned reductions in originated and acquired residential mortgages of million 
excluding these loans  average relationship based consumer loans increased  or million 
home equity lending is the main contributor to this strong loan growth 
an array of home equity loan products has been a key component of the bank s strategy to deepen its customer relationships 
this market strategy resulted in the million  or  increase in home equity average balances 
the production of direct consumer loans  primarily home equity loans and lines  
table of contents are generated by the bank s retail banking offices  phone centers and internet unit 
origination of consumer loan and line commitments  primarily home equity  in the greater washington dc and central virginia regions  grew from to while average consumer loan and line commitments from the greater baltimore market grew in other consumer loans  which make up of consumer loans mainly marine lending  had a million decline in management has chosen to restrict marine lending loan growth due to low pricing margins in the industry 
the corporation s portfolio of originated and acquired residential mortgage loans consisting of first mortgages  home equity loans and lines represented of average total loans in  compared to in at december   approximately of the acquired portfolio was in first lien position 
in  the corporation purchased million of residential mortgage loans compared to million in as it continues to focus on internally generated loan production versus purchases of loan portfolios 
average balances in the originated residential mortgage portfolio continued to decline during  to million  since the bank retains only a small percentage new residential mortgage loan originations 
the investment securities portfolio average balance declined by million in as compared to as management continued executing its strategy of replacing wholesale investments with internally generated loans 
from year end to year end  provident s investment portfolio declined by million  or from to of total assets 
investment purchases  which totaled million  were concentrated in abs  municipal bonds  and non agency cmos  which management believes exhibited superior value than traditional mbs or us government securities in investment purchases were funded through sales of mbs and floating rate abs totaling million  and maturities and paydowns of million 
in november  management sold million of fixed rate mbs yielding at a loss of million to improve future profitability and reduce the bank s investment in wholesale assets 
additionally  in december management sold million of mbs at a slight gain to fund loan growth 
management currently has the intent and ability to retain investment securities with unrealized losses until the decline in value has been recovered 
asset quality the following table presents information with respect to non performing assets and day delinquencies for the years indicated 
asset quality summary december  dollars in thousands non performing assets originated acquired residential mortgage other consumer commercial mortgage residential real estate construction commercial real estate construction commercial business total non accrual loans total renegotiated loans non real estate assets residential real estate total other assets and real estate owned total non performing assets day delinquencies originated acquired residential mortgage other consumer commercial business total day delinquencies asset quality ratios non performing loans to loans non performing assets to loans consumer non accrual loans are comprised entirely of credits secured by residential property and other secured loans  primarily purchased loans 
generally  closed end consumer loans secured by non residential collateral that become days past due are charged off down to their net fair value 
unsecured open end consumer loans are charged off in full at days past due 

table of contents the asset quality within the corporation s loan portfolios continued to remain strong throughout strong asset quality within the corporation s loan portfolio is a reflection of management s credit policies and strategy of shifting the balance sheet away from wholesale loans to relationship based loan portfolios 
in addition  regional credit conditions were favorable in non performing assets were million at december   down million from december   and down as a percentage of loans  from to 
the decline in non performing assets was mainly a result of successful workout efforts relating to several long standing non performing commercial business loans in the fourth quarter of the total non performing loans  million are in the consumer and residential mortgage loan portfolios  which are collateralized by to family residences  million are in the commercial business portfolio and million are in the commercial mortgage portfolio 
non performing commercial business loans include million of loans that have us government guarantees 
management expects little further loss on those loans 
overall  asset quality ratios of the corporation at december  remain favorable  but no assurances can be given regarding the level of non performing assets in the future 
total day delinquencies decreased by million in to million  and as a result  total day delinquencies as a percentage of total loans outstanding were in compared to in presented below is interest income that would have been recorded on all non accrual loans if such loans had been paid in accordance with their original terms and the interest income on such loans that was actually received and recorded for the year

the entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any type of loan 
allocation of allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands consumer commercial real estate mortgage residential real estate construction commercial real estate construction commercial business unallocated total allowance for loan losses 
table of contents the application of the corporation s collection and credit standards and the continuation of strong regional economic conditions resulted in lower net charge offs compared to net charge offs for were million compared to million in for  net charge offs exceeded the provision for loan losses by thousand 
the allowance as a percentage of loans outstanding decreased from at december  to at december   while the allowance coverage increased to of non performing loans at december   compared to at december  portfolio wide net charge offs continued to show a year over year decline and was of average loans in  down from in this decline is mainly driven by the million decrease in net charge offs in the commercial business portfolio 
during  the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses declined by million while the portion allocated to the residential real estate increased by million 
the increase in the allocation to the residential real estate construction is mainly a result of the million year over year increase in this portfolio 
management believes that the allowance at december  represents its best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio and that it uses relevant information available to make such determinations 
if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making determinations  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be affected 
based on information currently available to the corporation  management believes it has established its existing allowance in accordance with gaap 
because events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that increases to the allowance will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
sources of funds the following table summarizes the composition of the corporation s average deposit and borrowing balances for the periods indicated 
average deposits and borrowings year ended december  variance variance dollars in thousands deposits noninterest bearing interest bearing demand money market savings direct time deposits brokered time deposits total average deposits borrowings fed funds fhlb borrowings repos and other trust preferred securities total average borrowings total average deposits and borrowings deposits by source consumer commercial brokered total deposits average deposits increased million  or  in the deposit growth came from all the deposit sources consumer  commercial and brokered in with the main growth occurring in brokered time deposits 
deposits from consumers grew million  or  while deposits from commercial businesses grew million  or 
brokered time deposits increased by million  or 
as a result of the favorable pricing in the brokered certificates of deposit market  management increased the certificates of deposit portfolio and reduced the variable rate borrowing portfolio in as it was a less expensive form of 
table of contents borrowing 
the sum of the brokered deposits and borrowings was essentially unchanged year over year 
increased competition with non banks in the current rising rate environment was the main reason for the moderate growth in customer deposits 
in addition  during  consumer and commercial customers have been shifting their deposits from low yielding checking and savings accounts to higher yielding certificates of deposit accounts or moving their deposits to alternative markets 
this change is driven by the current rate environment and the intense level of competition 
disciplined deposit pricing by management has resulted in lower deposit costs compared to the industry 
in  average borrowings declined by million  or  from as noted above  the decline was largely financed by the increase in brokered certificates of deposit production 
throughout much of  brokered certificates of deposit were priced at rates below the libor rate curve  while variable rate long term borrowings were priced essentially flat to the libor rate curve 
liquidity an important component of the bank s asset liability structure is the level of liquidity available to meet the needs of customers and creditors 
traditional sources of bank liquidity include deposit growth  loan repayments  investment maturities  asset sales  borrowings and interest received 
management believes the bank has sufficient liquidity to meet future funding needs 
the bank s chief source of liquidity is the assets it possesses  which can either be pledged as collateral for secured borrowings or sold outright 
the bank s primary sources for raising secured borrowings are the fhlb and securities broker dealers 
at december   billion of secured borrowings were employed  with sufficient collateral available to immediately raise an additional million 
an excess liquidity position of million remains after covering million of unsecured funds that mature in the next three months 
additionally  over million of assets are maintained as collateral with the federal reserve that are available as a contingent funding source 
the bank also has several sources of unsecured funding that it uses routinely 
at december   the bank possessed over billion of overnight borrowing capacity  of which only million was in use at year end 
the brokered certificates of deposit and unsecured debt markets  which generally are more expensive than secured funds of similar maturity  are also viable funding alternatives 
in  the bank issued million of brokered certificates of deposit at favorable pricing levels 
as an alternative to raising secured funds  the bank can raise liquidity through asset sales 
at december   over million of the bank s investment portfolio was immediately saleable at a market value equaling or exceeding its amortized cost basis 
investment portfolio liquidity has been enhanced by the addition of approximately million of libor floating rate securities primarily replacing fixed rate mbs 
additionally  over a day time frame  a majority of the bank s billion consumer and residential loan portfolios are saleable under normal conditions 
a significant use of the corporation s liquidity is the dividends it pays to shareholders 
the corporation is a one bank holding company that relies upon the bank s performance to generate capital growth through bank earnings 
a portion of the bank s earnings is passed to the corporation in the form of cash dividends 
as a commercial bank under the maryland financial institution law  the bank may declare cash dividends from undivided profits or  with the prior approval of the commissioner of financial regulation  out of paid in capital in excess of of its required capital stock  and after providing for due or accrued expenses  losses  interest and taxes 
these dividends paid to the holding company are utilized to pay dividends to stockholders  repurchase shares and pay interest on junior subordinated debentures 
the corporation and the bank  in declaring and paying dividends  are also limited insofar as minimum capital requirements of regulatory authorities must be maintained 
the corporation and the bank comply with such capital requirements 
if the corporation or the bank were unable to comply with the minimum capital requirements  it could result in regulatory actions that could have a material impact on the corporation 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the corporation has various contractual obligations  such as long term borrowings  that are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain minimum lease payments for the use of banking and operations offices under operating lease agreements  are not recognized as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed 
each of these arrangements affects the corporation s determination of sufficient liquidity 

table of contents the following table summarizes significant contractual obligations and commitments at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal payments on outstanding borrowings 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  as referenced in the following table 
contractual payments due by period in thousands less than year years years after years total lease commitments note long term debt note total contractual payment obligations arrangements to fund credit products or guarantee financing take the form of loan commitments including lines of credit on revolving credit structures and letters of credit 
approvals for these arrangements are obtained in the same manner as loans 
generally  cash flows  collateral value and a risk assessment are considered when determining the amount and structure of credit arrangements 
commitments to extend credit in the form of consumer  commercial real estate and business loans at december  were as follows in thousands commercial business and real estate consumer revolving credit residential mortgage credit performance standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit total loan commitments historically  many of the commitments expire without being fully drawn  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
obligations also take the form of commitments to purchase loans 
at december   the corporation did not have any firm commitments to purchase loans 
contingencies and risk the corporation enters into certain transactions that may either contain risks or represent contingencies 
these risks or contingencies may take the form of concentrations of credit risk or litigation 
disclosure of these arrangements is found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
risk management the nature of the banking business  which involves paying interest on deposits at varying rates and terms and charging interest on loans at other rates and terms  creates interest rate risk 
as a result  earnings and the market value of assets and liabilities are subject to fluctuations  which arise due to changes in the level and directions of interest rates 
management s objective is to minimize the fluctuation in the net interest margin caused by changes in interest rates using cost effective strategies and tools 
the bank manages several forms of interest rate risk  including asset liability mismatch  basis risk and prepayment risk 
the corporation purchases amortizing loan pools and investment securities in which the underlying assets are residential mortgage loans subject to prepayments 
the actual principal reduction on these assets varies from the expected contractual principal reduction due to principal prepayments resulting from borrowers elections to refinance the underlying mortgages based on market and other conditions 
prepayment rate projections utilize actual prepayment speed experience and available market information on like kind instruments 
the prepayment rates form the basis for income recognition of premiums or discounts on the related assets 
changes in prepayment estimates may cause the earnings recognized on these assets to vary over the term that the assets are held  creating volatility in the net interest margin 
prepayment rate assumptions are monitored and updated monthly to reflect actual activity and the most recent market projections 
management continually monitors prime libor basis risk and asset liability mismatch 
basis risk exists as a result of having much of the bank s earning assets priced using either the prime rate or the us treasury yield curve  while much of the liability portfolio  which finances earning assets  is priced using the certificates of deposit yield curve or libor yield curve 
these different yield curves are highly correlated but do not move in lock step with one another 
additionally  management routinely monitors and limits the mismatch between assets and liabilities subject to repricing on a monthly  quarterly  semiannual and annual basis 

table of contents measuring and managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process that management performs continually to meet the objective of maintaining a stable net interest margin 
this process relies chiefly on simulation modeling of shocks to the balance sheet under a variety of interest rate scenarios  including parallel and non parallel rate shifts  such as the forward yield curves for both short and long term interest rates 
the results of these shocks are measured in two forms first  the impact on the net interest margin and earnings over one and two year time frames  and second  the impact on the market value of equity 
in addition to measuring the basis risks and prepayment risks noted above  simulations also quantify the earnings impact of rate changes and the cost benefit of hedging strategies 
the following table shows the anticipated effect on net interest income in parallel shift up or down interest rate scenarios 
these shifts are assumed to begin on january  for the december  data and on january  for the december  data and evenly ramp up or down over a six month period 
the effect on net interest income would be for the next twelve months 
projected percentage change in net interest income at december interest rate scenario basis points basis points no change basis points basis points the projected outcomes presented below are based on a balance sheet growth forecast and parallel shifts in interest rates  ie all interest rates moving by the same amount 
management models many non parallel rate change scenarios as well  including several yield curve flattening and steepening scenarios 
the results of each scenario differ  however  the results below are an accurate indication of the magnitude and direction of the corporation s interest rate risk 
the percentage changes displayed in the table above relate to the corporation s projected net interest income 
management s intent is for derivative interest income to mitigate risk to the corporation s net interest income stemming from changes in interest rates 
for comparison purposes  these projections include all interest earned on derivatives in net interest income 
the analysis includes the interest income or expense relating to non designated interest rate swaps that is classified in non interest income as net cash settlement on swaps 
the isolated modeling environment  assuming no action by management  shows that the corporation s net interest income volatility is less than under probable single direction scenarios 
the corporation s one year forward earnings are slightly asset sensitive  which will result in net interest income moving in the same direction as future interest rates 
the corporation s interest rate risk has been reduced from to  reflecting management s increased uncertainty with the direction of future interest rate changes following the federal reserve s curtailment of fed funds rate increases in june management employs the investment  borrowing  and derivatives portfolios in implementing the bank s interest rate strategy 
mitigating yield curve inversion risk has been a significant element of interest rate risk management in to protect the bank from rising short term interest rates  over million of the investment portfolio reprices semiannually or more frequently 
in the borrowings portfolio  million of funds reset their rates with long term interest rates  such as the year constant maturity swap rate  to protect the net interest margin from falling long term interest rates 
the interest expense associated with these borrowings declines when long term interest rates decline 
additionally  million of interest rate swaps were in force to reduce interest rate risk  and million of interest rate caps were employed specifically to protect against rising interest rates in the future 
capital resources total stockholders equity was million at december   an increase of million from december  the change in stockholders equity for the year was attributable to million in earnings that was partially offset by dividends declared or paid of million

net interest income the corporation s principal source of revenue is net interest income  the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
interest income is presented on a tax equivalent basis to recognize associated tax benefits in order to provide a basis for comparison of yields with taxable earning assets 
the following table presents information regarding the average balance of assets and liabilities  as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from average interest earning assets and interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities and the resulting average yields and costs 
the yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods presented 
nonaccrual loans are included in average balances  however  accrued interest income has been excluded from these loans

table of contents the net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  increased basis points to from in and was driven by the continued balance sheet transitioning away from wholesale assets to growth in core lending activities 
in  management s strategy of replacing lower net interest earning assets with higher net interest earning assets continued to be successful 
the corporation experienced solid loan growth in its home equity and construction loan portfolios from the same period a year ago 
growth in these loan portfolios was offset by the planned declines in wholesale assets acquired residential portfolios and investment securities 
overall  year over year average earning assets grew slightly to billion as a result of strong internally generated loan growth being offset by the planned reductions in wholesale assets 
the net loan growth of million in relationship based loans was offset by planned reductions of million in originated and acquired loans and a million reduction in investment securities 
the yields on investments and loans grew and basis points  respectively 
the yield increase in the loan and investment portfolios resulted from the increase in market interest rates and the corporation s balance sheet restructuring program  which placed greater emphasis on variable rate securities 
interest bearing liabilities remained flat for the year while the average rate paid increased basis points 
the increase in the average rate paid was mainly due to rising interest rates that impacted all sources of deposits  short term borrowings and long term debt 
interest expense was also negatively impacted by a million decline in average noninterest bearing demand deposit balances during the year as customers shifted their deposits to interest bearing demand deposits as a result of the rising rate environment 
the yield on earning assets increased from in as a result of rising interest rates and the continued strong demand for both commercial and consumer loans which more than offset the increased cost on total interest bearing liabilities of 
growth in these key banking segment loans  financed by a reduction in lower yielding investments were the primary drivers behind the million increase year over year in total interest income 
this activity  together with a shift in funding from long term debt to deposits were the contributing factors to a million growth in net interest income and a basis point expansion in net interest margin 
the corporation has an ongoing risk management strategy of using derivative transactions to maintain a stable net interest margin 
as a result of derivative transactions undertaken to mitigate the affect of interest rate risk on the corporation  interest income increased thousand and interest expense increased by thousand  for a total decrease of thousand in net interest income relating to derivative transactions for the year ended december  future growth in net interest income will depend upon consumer and commercial loan demand  growth in deposits and the general level of interest rates 
provision for loan losses the corporation continued to emphasize quality underwriting as well as aggressive management of charge offs and potential problem loans  resulting in a provision for loan losses of million in compared to million in net charge offs were million  or of average loans in  compared to million  or of average loans  in the decline is mainly driven by the million decrease in net charge offs in the commercial business portfolio 
total consumer loan net charge offs as a percentage of average total consumer loans were in compared to in total commercial net charge offs as a percentage of average commercial loans were  a decrease from in the decline in charge offs in both the consumer and commercial portfolios is a reflection of management s credit policies and strategy of shifting the balance sheet to relationship based loan portfolios 
by historical standards  credit conditions for the corporation  as well as for the industry as a whole have been superior 
the sustainability of these conditions into the future for the industry is uncertain
