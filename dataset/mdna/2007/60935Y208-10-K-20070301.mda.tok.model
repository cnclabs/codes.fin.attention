this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
moneygram s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to various factors discussed under cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our separation from viad corp on july   viad announced a plan to separate its payment services segment  operated by travelers  from its other businesses into a new company  and to effect a tax free distribution of its shares in that company to viad s stockholders 
on december   moneygram was incorporated in delaware as a subsidiary of viad for the purpose of effecting the proposed distribution 
on june   travelers was merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of moneygram and viad distributed  shares of moneygram common stock to viad 
table of contents stockholders in a tax free distribution 
stockholders of viad received one share of moneygram common stock for every one share of viad common stock owned 
the continuing business of viad consists of the businesses of the convention show services  exhibit design and construction  and travel and recreation services operations  including viad s centralized corporate functions located in phoenix  arizona new viad 
notwithstanding the legal form of the spin off  due to the relative significance of moneygram to viad  moneygram is considered the divesting entity and treated as the accounting successor to viad for financial reporting purposes in accordance with the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
accounting for reverse spin offs 
the spin off of new viad has been accounted for pursuant to accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for non monetary transactions 
moneygram charged million directly to equity as a dividend  which is the historical cost carrying amount of the net assets of new viad 
as part of the separation from viad  we entered into a variety of agreements with viad to govern each of our responsibilities related to the distribution 
these agreements include a separation and distribution agreement  a tax sharing agreement  an employee benefits agreement and an interim services agreement 
subsequently  in the interim services agreement was terminated 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the spin off  we entered into a bank credit agreement providing availability of up to million in the form of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
on june   we borrowed million under this facility  which was paid to and used by viad to repay million of its commercial paper 
viad also retired a substantial majority of its outstanding subordinated debentures and medium term notes for an aggregate amount of million including a tender premium  retired industrial revenue bonds of million and redeemed outstanding preferred stock at an aggregate call price of million 
basis of presentation our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the consolidated financial statements include the historical results of operations of viad in discontinued operations in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
there are certain amounts related to other investment income  debt and costs associated with viad s centralized corporate functions that are related to viad  but in accordance with gaap are not allowed to be reflected in discontinued operations as these costs were not specifically allocated to viad subsidiaries 
the consolidated financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of our results of operations  financial position and cash flows in the future or what our results of operations  financial position and cash flows would have been had we operated as a stand alone company during the period presented 
in march  we completed the sale of game financial corporation for approximately million in cash 
game financial corporation provides cash access services to casinos and gaming establishments throughout the united states 
as a result of the sale  we recorded an after tax gain of million in the first quarter of in addition  in june  we recorded an after tax gain of million from the settlement of a lawsuit brought by game financial corporation 
during  we recorded a million gain in connection with the partial resolution of contingencies relating to the sale of game financial corporation 
these amounts are reflected in the consolidated statements of income in income and gain from discontinued operations  net of tax  along with the operating results of viad  including spin off related costs of million for the year ended december  the following discussion of our results of operations is focused on our continuing businesses 

table of contents results of operations summary following are significant items affecting operating results from continuing operations in global funds transfer segment revenue grew percent in  driven by percent revenue growth in money transfer 
our money order transaction volume declined four percent in as expected  which is slightly less than the trend for paper based instruments 
based on current industry information  the trend in paper based payment instruments is estimated to be an annual decline of five to eight percent 
the net investment margin of percent see table improved over the net investment margin of percent primarily due to higher yields on the portfolio related to higher short term interest rates and a successful hedging strategy 
fee and other revenue increased percent in  primarily from growth in money transfer transaction volume 
marketing expenditures increased over percent as we invest in our brand 
our effective tax rate of percent increased in compared to percent in primarily due to tax exempt investment income declining as a percentage of total pre tax income 
in  we continued to realize strong transaction volume growth in our money transfer product which includes our bill payment services 
money order volumes and average investable balances declined as expected 
the decline in money orders is consistent with the overall decreasing use of paper based instruments  while the decline in average investable balances is due to the consolidation of financial institutions and a slowing of consumer mortgage transactions 
in  we operated in a flat yield curve environment  where short term and long term interest rates were about the same 
this is a challenging environment for our official check business as it puts pressure on our net investment margin by holding investment yields down while investment commissions increase more quickly 
despite this pressure  we realized growth in our net investment margin through a successful hedging strategy and adjusting pricing to reflect the current interest rate environment as contracts renew 
the credit quality of our investment portfolio continued to improve  as evidenced by the cash recoveries on previously impaired investments and lower impairment charges taken in components of net revenue our net revenue consists of fee and other revenue  investment revenue and net securities gains and losses  less commission expense 
we generate net revenue primarily by charging transaction fees in excess of third party agent commissions  managing foreign currency exchange and managing our investments to provide returns in excess of commissions paid to financial institution customers 
we derive revenue primarily through service fees charged to consumers and through our investments 
fee and other revenue consist of transaction fees  foreign exchange and miscellaneous revenue 
transaction fees are fees earned on the sale of money transfers  retail money order and bill payment products and official check transactions 
money transfer transaction fees are fixed per transaction and may vary based upon the face value of the amount of the transaction and the location in which the money transfer originates and to which it is sent 
money order and bill payment transaction fees are fixed per transaction 
foreign exchange revenue is derived from the management of currency exchange spreads on international money transfer transactions 
miscellaneous revenue primarily consists of processing fees on rebate checks and controlled disbursements  service charges on aged outstanding money orders and money order dispenser fees 
investment revenue consists of interest and dividends generated through the investment of cash balances received from the sale of official checks  money orders and other payment instruments 
these cash balances are available to us for investment until the payment instrument is presented for payment 
investment revenue varies depending on the level of investment balances and the yield on our investments 
investment balances vary based on the number of payment instruments sold  the average face amount of those payment instruments and the average length of time that passes until the instruments are presented for payment 
net securities gains and losses consist of realized gains and losses on the sale of investments  as well as other than temporary impairments of investments 

table of contents we incur commission expense on our money transfer products and our investments 
we pay fee commissions to our third party agents for money transfer services 
in a money transfer transaction  both the agent initiating the transaction and the agent disbursing the funds receive a commission 
the commission amount generally is based on a percentage of the fee charged to the consumers 
we generally do not pay commissions to agents on the sale of money orders 
fee commissions also include the amortization of capitalized incentive payments to agents 
investment commissions are amounts paid to financial institution customers based on the average outstanding cash balances generated by the sale of official checks  as well as costs associated with swaps and the sale of receivables program 
in connection with our interest rate swaps  we pay a fixed amount to a counterparty and receive a variable rate payment in return 
to the extent that the fixed rate exceeds the variable rate  we incur an expense related to the swap  conversely  if the variable rate exceeds the fixed rate  we receive income related to the swap 
under our receivables program  we sell our receivables at a discount to accelerate our cash flow  this discount is recorded as an expense 
commissions paid to financial institution customers generally are variable based on short term interest rates 
we utilize interest rate swaps  as described above  to convert a portion of our variable rate commission payments to fixed rate payments 
these swaps assist us in managing the interest rate risk associated with the variable rate commissions paid to our financial institution customers

it is a growing portion of our total revenue  increasing to percent of total revenue for from percent in compared to  fee and other revenue grew percent in  primarily driven by transaction growth in our money transfer and bill payment services  with volumes increasing percent during the year 
total revenue growth rates are lower than money transfer volume growth rates due to simplified pricing in the money transfer business and product mix higher money transfer and bill payment volume growth with a decline in money order transactions 
also  our domestic transactions  which contribute lower revenue per transaction  are growing at a faster rate than internationally originated transactions 
our simplified pricing initiatives include reducing the number of pricing tiers or bands and allow us to manage our price volume dynamic while streamlining the point of sale process for our agents and customers 
our pricing philosophy continues to be to maintain a price point below our higher priced competitor but above the niche players in the market 
the gap between total revenue growth and money transfer transaction growth narrowed in the fourth quarter of as we began to lap the first year of implementation of simplified pricing initiatives 
for and  fee and other revenue was and percent of total revenue  respectively  with percent growth in versus the prior year 
this growth was primarily driven by transaction growth in our money transfer and bill payment services  with volume increasing percent during the year 
as in  revenue growth rates were lower than money transfer volume growth rates  for the same reasons 
fee commissions consist primarily of fees paid to our third party agents for the money transfer service 
fee commissions expense was up percent for as compared to the prior year  primarily driven by higher transaction volume and tiered commissions 
tiered commissions are commission rates that are adjusted upward  subject to certain caps  as an agent s transaction volume grows 
we use tiered commission rates as an incentive for select agents to grow transaction volume by paying our agents for performance and allowing them to participate in adding market share for moneygram 
fiscal fee commissions expense increased percent over  again primarily due to higher transaction volume 
net fee revenue increased percent in compared to  driven by the increase in volume of money transfer and bill payment transactions

net fee revenue increased percent in compared to  primarily due to the increase in money transfer and bill payment transaction volumes 
growth in net fee revenue was lower than fee and other revenue growth in  primarily due to the pricing structure of certain large money order agents  as well as product mix

the average balance in the table reflects only the payment service obligations for which commissions are paid and does not include the average balance of the sold receivables million  and million for  and  respectively as these are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets 
average yields rates are calculated by dividing the applicable amount shown in the components of net investment revenue section by the applicable amount shown in the average balances section 
the net investment margin is calculated by dividing net investment revenue by the cash equivalents and investments average balance 
investment revenue in increased seven percent over due to higher yields on the portfolio from rising short term interest rates  which was partially offset by lower average investable balances

in  investment revenue increased percent over  due to higher yields on cash and adjustable rate securities  million in cash flows from previously impaired investments and income from limited partnership interests 
investment commissions expense in and increased four and nine percent  respectively  compared to the prior year  as rising short term rates resulted in higher commissions paid to financial institution customers and increased the amount of the cost of receivables sold 
the impact of rising rates was significantly offset by lower swap costs

included in the first six months of are approximately million of expenses allocated from viad that did not recur in as part of our spin off from viad  we entered into an interim services agreement which provided for services to be provided by viad on an interim basis 
we were obligated under this interim services agreement to pay approximately million annually  or million quarterly  beginning july  we terminated certain services under the interim services agreement effective on september  and terminated substantially all remaining services effective in the second quarter of as a result of this termination  our payments to viad were for the twelve months ended december  following is a discussion of the operating expenses presented in table compensation and benefits compensation and benefits includes salaries and benefits  management incentive programs  severance costs and other employee related costs

transaction and operations support transaction and operations support expenses include marketing costs  professional fees and other outside services costs  telecommunications and forms expense related to our products 
transaction and operations support costs were up nine percent in over  primarily driven by a percent increase in marketing expenditures as we continue to invest in our brand and support our agent growth and a percent increase in professional fees to support enhancements to our technology systems 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in provision for agent loss as there was an additional provision for uncollectible agent receivables of million in in addition  in  we recognized an impairment of million due to the discontinuation of a software development project 
transactions and operations support costs increased percent in compared to  primarily driven by marketing expenditures  higher transaction volumes  use of professional services  legal matters and increased provisions for uncollectible agent receivables  partially offset by the absence of viad allocations 
marketing expenditures increased just over percent from as we invested in our money transfer brand recognition 
in 
table of contents  we incurred higher professional services costs primarily due to the compliance initiatives related to section of the sarbanes oxley act and the regulatory environment  software development and other projects 
in addition  we incurred additional costs related to the emoney transfer service that was launched in march as we moved processing in house from a third party processor during during the first quarter of  we incurred million of costs related to the settlement of one legal matter and the accrual for an expected settlement in another legal matter related to our global funds transfer segment 
we recognized additional provisions for uncollectible agent receivables of million related to a specific agent in the new york check casher channel 
we continue to see a trend among state and federal regulators toward enhanced scrutiny of anti money laundering compliance 
as we continue to add staff resources and enhancements to our technology systems to address this trend  our transaction expenses will likely increase 
in addition  we anticipate that our transaction expenses will increase due to marketing spend  investment in the agent network and development of our retail network in western europe  however  we anticipate these expenses will grow at a moderately slower rate than  based on our assumed agent network growth of to percent 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on point of sale equipment  computer hardware and software including capitalized software development costs  and office furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements 
depreciation and amortization expense increased percent in compared to  primarily due to the depreciation of agent equipment  amortization of our investment in computer hardware and capitalized software to enhance the money transfer platform and the amortization of leasehold improvements offset by a corresponding reduction in rent expense 
our investments in computer hardware and software helped drive the growth in the money transfer product 
depreciation and amortization expense was up percent in over  primarily due to the amortization of computer hardware and capitalized software developed to enhance the money transfer platform 
occupancy  equipment and supplies occupancy  equipment and supplies includes facilities rent and maintenance costs  software and equipment maintenance costs  freight and delivery costs  and supplies 
occupancy  equipment and supplies expense in increased percent over  primarily due to higher software maintenance costs and normal increases in facilities rent  which were partially offset by gains on disposal of equipment 
occupancy  equipment and supplies expense increased two percent in compared to  primarily driven by software and asset maintenance  partially offset by rent reductions from the amortization of lease incentives 
software expense and maintenance increases relate primarily to purchased licenses to support our growth and compliance initiatives  as well as licensing costs which were incurred by viad prior to the spin off 
interest expense interest expense increased four percent in as compared to  primarily due to higher average interest rates  which were partially offset by receipts under our cash flow hedges 
interest expense increased percent in as compared to  primarily driven by expenses related to the amendment of our bank credit facility and rising interest rates 
in connection with the amendment of our million bank credit facility in the second quarter of  we expensed million of unamortized financing costs related to the original facility 
viad paid down million of debt in in connection with the spin off 
see management s discussion and analysis other funding sources and requirements for further information regarding the amendment of our bank credit facility 
debt tender and redemption costs debt tender and redemption costs incurred during of million relate to the redemption of viad s preferred shares and tender for its subordinated debt and medium term notes in connection with the spin off 
no such costs were incurred in or income taxes the effective tax rate was percent in  compared to percent in and percent in the corporate tax rate is lower than the statutory rate due primarily to income from tax exempt bonds in our investment portfolio 
the tax rate in benefited from a reduction in provision of million due to reversal of tax reserves no longer needed due to the passage of time and changes in estimates of tax amounts 
these benefits were offset by the decline in tax exempt investment income as a percentage of total pre tax income 
in addition  the effective tax rate was adversely affected by the costs related to the redemption of viad s redeemable preferred shares  which are not tax deductible

in addition  we strive to maintain adequate liquidity for capital expenditures and other normal operating cash needs 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  net receivables of  million and investments of  million  all substantially restricted for payment service obligations 
we rely on the funds from ongoing sales of payment instruments and portfolio cash flows to settle payment service obligations as they are presented 
due to the continuous nature of the sales and settlement of our payment instruments  we are able to invest in securities with a longer term than the average life of our payment instruments 
the company is regulated by various state agencies which generally require us to maintain liquid assets and investments with an investment rating of a or higher in an amount generally equal to the payment service obligation for those regulated payment instruments  namely teller checks  agent checks  money orders  and money transfers 
consequently  a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents  receivables and investments are restricted to satisfy the liability to pay the face amount of regulated payment service obligations upon presentment 
the company is not regulated by state agencies for payment service obligations resulting from outstanding cashier s checks  however  the company restricts a portion of the funds related to these payment instruments due to contractual arrangements and or company policy 
assets restricted for regulatory or contractual reasons are not available to satisfy working capital or other financing requirements 
the regulatory and contractual requirements do not require the company to specify individual assets held to meet our payment service obligations  nor is the company required to deposit specific assets into a trust  escrow or other special account 
rather  the company must maintain a pool of liquid assets 
no third party places limitations  legal or otherwise  on the company regarding the

on june   the company borrowed million consisting of the million term loan and million under the revolving credit facility and used all of the proceeds to pay merger consideration to viad in connection with the spin off 
on june   the company amended its bank credit facility 
the amended agreement extends the maturity date of the facility from june to june  and the scheduled repayment of the million term loan to june under the amended agreement  the credit facility may be increased to million under certain circumstances 
in addition  the amended agreement reduced the interest rate applicable to both the term loan and the credit facility to libor plus basis points  subject to adjustment in the event of a change in the credit rating of our senior unsecured debt 
the amendment also reduced usage fees on the facility to a range of percent to percent  depending on the credit rating of our senior unsecured debt 
restrictive covenants relating to dividends and share buybacks were eliminated  and the dollar value of permissible acquisitions without lender consent was increased 
in connection with the amendment  the company expensed million of unamortized deferred financing costs relating to the original bank credit facility during the quarter ended june  the company also incurred million of financing costs to complete the amendment 
these costs have been capitalized and will be amortized over the life of the debt 
the remaining availability under the bank credit facility is available for general corporate purposes and to support letters of credit 
loans under the bank credit facility are guaranteed on an unsecured basis by moneygram s material domestic subsidiaries 
borrowings under the bank credit facilities are subject to various covenants  including interest coverage ratio  leverage ratio and consolidated total indebtedness ratio 
the interest coverage ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest expense must not be less than to the leverage ratio of total debt to total capitalization must be less than to the consolidated total indebtedness ratio of total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization must be less than to at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
on december   the interest rate under the bank credit facility was percent  exclusive of the effect of commitment fees and other costs  and the facility fee was percent 
in september  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million to hedge our variable rate debt 
these swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges 
at december   the two debt swaps had an average fixed pay rate of percent and an average variable receive rate of percent 
at december   we had reverse repurchase agreements  letters of credit and various overdraft facilities totaling billion available to assist in the management of our investments and the clearing of payment service obligations

moneygram has funded  noncontributory pension plans 
our funding policy is to contribute at least the minimum contribution required by applicable regulations 
during  moneygram contributed million to the funded pension plans 
there are no required contributions for the pension plan in  however  the company may choose to make contributions 
moneygram also has certain unfunded pension and postretirement plans that require benefit payments over extended periods of time 
during  we paid benefits totaling million related to these unfunded plans 
the company will continue to contribute to its unfunded plans as benefit payments are required 
benefit payments under these unfunded plans are expected to be million in expected contributions and benefit payments under these plans are not included in the table above 
see critical accounting policies pension obligations for further discussion of these plans

we are currently reviewing the impact of this new law 
included in the consolidated balance sheets under accounts payable and other liabilities and property and equipment is million of property and equipment received by the company but not paid as of december  these amounts were paid by the company in january and february we have agreements with clearing banks that provide processing and clearing functions for money orders and official checks 
one clearing bank contract has covenants that include maintenance of total cash and cash equivalents  receivables and investments substantially restricted for payment services obligations at least equal to total outstanding payment service obligations  as well as maintenance of a minimum ratio of total assets held at that bank to instruments clearing through that bank of percent 
we were not in compliance with one covenant at december   however  the noncompliance was cured on january   through a shift in our investment portfolio 
working in cooperation with various financial institutions  we established separate consolidated entities special purpose entities and processes that provide these financial institutions with additional assurance of our ability to clear their official checks 
these processes include maintenance of specified ratios of segregated investments to outstanding payment instruments  typically to we remain liable to satisfy the obligations  both contractually and or by operation of the uniform commercial code  as issuer and drawer of the official checks 
accordingly  the obligations have been recorded in the consolidated balance sheets under payment service obligations 
under limited circumstances  clients have the right to either demand liquidation of the segregated assets or replace us as the administrator of the special purpose entity 
such limited circumstances consist of material and in most cases continued failure of moneygram to uphold its warranties and obligations pursuant to its underlying agreements with the financial institution clients 
while an orderly liquidation of assets would be required  any of these actions by a client could nonetheless diminish the value of the total investment portfolio  decrease earnings  and result in loss of the client or other customers or prospects 
we offer the special purpose entity to certain financial institution clients as a benefit unique in the payment services industry 
the company has investment grade ratings of bbb baa and a stable outlook from the three major credit rating agencies 
our ability to maintain an investment grade rating is important because it affects the cost of borrowing and certain financial institution customers require that we maintain an investment grade rating 
any ratings downgrade could increase our cost of borrowing or require certain actions to be performed to rectify such a situation 
a downgrade could also have an effect on our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers 
although no assurance can be given  we expect operating cash flows and short term borrowings to be sufficient to finance our ongoing business  maintain adequate capital levels  and meet debt and clearing agreement covenants and investment grade rating requirements 
should financing requirements exceed such sources of funds  we believe we have adequate external financing sources available to cover any shortfall  including unused commitments under our credit facilities 
the company has an effective universal shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission 
the universal shelf registration provides for the issuance of up to million of our securities  including common stock  preferred stock and debt securities

as of december   we have repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock under this authorization and have remaining authorization to purchase up to  shares 
on august   the company s board of directors approved a small stockholder selling repurchasing program 
this program enables moneygram stockholders with less than shares of common stock as of august   to voluntarily purchase additional stock to reach shares or sell all of their shares back to the company 
we have purchased a total of  shares related to this program  which has ended as of december  during  we paid million in dividends on our common stock 
in addition  the board of directors declared a dividend of per share of common stock on february  to be paid on april  to stockholders of record on march  any future determination to pay dividends on moneygram common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition  results of operations  cash requirements  prospects and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant 
during we increased the quarterly dividend from to per share 
we intend to continue paying a quarterly dividend of per share in  subject to board approval  which will be funded through cash generated from operating activities 
viad sold treasury stock in to its employee equity trust to fund certain existing employee compensation and benefit plans 
in connection with the spin off  viad transferred  shares of moneygram common stock to the moneygram international  inc employee equity trust the trust to be used by moneygram to fund employee compensation and benefit plans 
at december   the trust held  shares of moneygram common stock 
the market value of the shares held by this trust of million at december  represents unearned employee benefits that are recorded as a deduction from common stock and other equity and is reduced as employee benefits are funded 
for financial reporting purposes  the trust is consolidated 
off balance sheet arrangements the finance and investment committee of the board of directors generally approves any transactions and strategies  including any potential off balance sheet arrangements  which materially affect investment results and cash flows 
sale of receivables we have an agreement to sell  on a periodic basis  undivided percentage ownership interests in certain receivables  primarily from our money order agents  in an amount not to exceed million 
these receivables are sold to commercial paper conduits trusts sponsored by a financial institution and represent a small percentage of the total assets in these conduits

 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the assets and liabilities associated with these conduits  including our sold receivables  are not recorded or included in our financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  the company extended the agreement through december the business purpose of this arrangement is to accelerate cash flow for investment 
the receivables are sold at a discount based upon short term interest rates 
executive management regularly reviews performance under the terms of the agreement 
on average we sold receivables totaling million during for a total discount of million

table of contents enterprise risk management risk is an inherent part of our business  including interest rate risk  liquidity risk  credit risk  operational risk  regulatory risk and foreign currency exchange risk 
see part  item a risk factors for a description of the principal risks to our business 
the company s risk management objective is to monitor and control risk exposures to produce steady earnings growth and long term economic value 
the extent to which we properly and effectively manage each of the various types of risk is critical to our financial condition and profitability 
management implements board approved policies covering the company s funding activity  investing activity and use of derivatives 
the company s board of directors has a finance and investment committee  consisting of five independent board members  which oversees its investment  capital  credit and foreign currency policies and strategies 
the board s finance and investment committee receives periodic reports regarding the investment portfolio and results 
an asset liability committee  comprised of senior management  routinely reviews investment and risk management strategies and results 
following is a discussion of the strategies used by the company to manage and mitigate interest rate risk  credit risk and foreign currency risk 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
the analyses used to assess interest rate risk  credit risk and foreign currency risk are not predictions of future events  and actual results may vary significantly due to events in the markets in which we operate and certain other factors as described in the following discussion 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the potential reduction in net investment revenue as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates 
fluctuations in interest rates affect the revenue produced by our investment portfolio  the amount of commissions that we pay to customers in our payment systems segment  the net proceeds from our sale of receivables and the amounts that we receive under our interest rate derivatives 
as a result  our net investment revenue  which is the difference or spread between the amount we earn on our investment portfolio and the commissions we pay and the discount on the sale of receivables  net of the effect of interest rate derivatives or swaps  is subject to interest rate risk as the components of net investment revenue are not perfectly matched through time and across all possible interest rate scenarios 
interest rate risk is concentrated in the investment portfolio 
certain investments in our portfolio  primarily fixed rate mortgage backed investments  are subject to prepayment with no penalty to the borrower 
as interest rates decrease  borrowers are more likely to prepay fixed rate debt  resulting in cash flows that are received earlier than expected 
replacing the higher rate investments that prepay with lower rate investments could reduce our net investment revenue 
conversely  an increase in interest rates may result in slower than expected prepayments and  therefore  cash flows that are received later than expected 
in this case  there is risk that the cost of our commission payments may reprice faster than our investments and at a higher cost  which could reduce our net investment revenue 
an additional component of interest rate risk is market risk that arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of investments and swaps 
rate movements can affect the repricing of assets and liabilities differently  as well as their market value 
stockholders equity can also be adversely affected by changing interest rates  as after tax changes in the fair value of securities classified as available for sale and after tax changes in the fair value of swaps are reflected as increases and decreases to a component of stockholders equity 
the fair value of our swaps generally increases when the market value of fixed rate  long term debt investments decline and vice versa 
however  the changes in the fair value of swaps and investments may not fully offset in stockholders equity 
the company s strategy in managing interest rate risk is to deliver consistent net interest margins and economic value over varying interest rate environments 
one element to our strategy is to purchase assets that have similar cash flow patterns to our payment service obligations through time and various interest rate environments 
to carry out this strategy  we purchase assets that match the average life and duration of our payment service obligations within a range that achieves stable net interest margins 
in addition  we purchase assets across a wide spectrum of average lives to achieve the desired asset duration 
we also use several different types of assets  including derivatives  to alter the average life of our assets and liabilities to match the duration of our payment service obligations within a desired range 
a second element to our strategy is to regularly assess the portfolio s exposure to 
table of contents changes in rates 
we use a wide range of risk measures and analyses to manage the exposure  including on going business risk measures and analyses  run off measures of the existing portfolio and stress test scenarios 
the two main evaluators used by the company are net income at risk and duration gap 
net income at risk is measured using a static and forecasted portfolio under various interest rate shock environments 
duration gap is the estimated gap between our assets and liabilities and summarizes the extent that estimated cash flows are matched over time across various interest rate environments 
the third element to our strategy is setting parameters for risk measures to help attain corporate margin objectives 
management develops actions based upon a number of factors that include both net investment revenue at risk and duration gap  as well as current market conditions 
internal indicators are used to determine when the risk profile of our assets should be re examined 
as the risk measures begin to move beyond our internal indicators  we consider actions to bring them into the preferred ranges  with an emphasis on time horizon and earnings objectives 
the company uses derivatives as an important tool in managing interest rate risk 
derivatives are used by the company as a hedging tool  we do not enter into speculative trading positions 
the company typically uses interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk on its variable rate commission payments to financial institution customers in its payment systems segment 
through these interest rate swaps  the company can effectively convert our variable rate commission payments to a fixed rate payment 
the company uses value at risk var modeling and net investment revenue simulation analysis for measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate risk 
the company has previously disclosed the impact to the market value of equity using a shock analysis as market value is measured at a point in time 
the shock analysis assumes an immediate and sustained change to the yield curve 
due to limitations in the shock analysis  including the assumption that interest rates fluctuate in a parallel shift across the yield curve  the company adopted var as a methodology for evaluating interest rate risk 
var is a risk assessment methodology that estimates the potential decline in the value of a security or portfolio under various market conditions 
var quantifies the change in market value due to changes in volatility and interest rates over a given time horizon  and given a certain level of confidence 
the company utilizes var to quantify the potential decline in the fair value of its investment portfolio using a confidence level and a one month time horizon 
the company uses a monte carlo model that derives the interest rate change from volatility assumptions  specified probability and time horizon 
the model includes the company s investment portfolio and interest rate derivative contracts 
at december   the var is million  given a confidence level and a one month time horizon 
accordingly  there is a percent chance the loss on the investment portfolio over the next month will exceed the million 
the high  low and average vars in were million  million and million  respectively 
the net investment revenue simulation analysis incorporates substantially all of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities  together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment 
this analysis assumes the yield curve increases gradually over a one year period 
table summarizes the changes to our pre tax income from continuing operations under various scenarios 
the modeling of our investment portfolio involves a number of assumptions including prepayments  interest rates and volatility 
the var model and net investment revenue simulation analysis are risk analysis tools and do not purport to represent actual losses that will be incurred by the company 
while we believe that these assumptions are reasonable  different assumptions could produce materially different estimates

table of contents credit risk credit risk represents the potential risk that the company may not collect on interest and or principal associated with its investments  as well as counterparty risk associated with its derivative financial instruments 
the company is also exposed to the potential risk that the company may not collect on funds received by agents in connection with money transfers and money orders  which are due to be remitted to the company 
approximately percent of the company s investment portfolio at december  consists of securities that are not issued or guaranteed by the us government 
if the issuer of any of these securities or counterparties to any of our derivative financial instruments were to default in payments or otherwise experience credit problems  the value of the investments and derivative financial instruments would decline and adversely impact our investment portfolio and earnings 
as it relates to the investment portfolio  the company s strategy is to maximize the relative value versus return on each security  sector and collateral class 
the company uses a comprehensive process to manage its credit risk relating to investments  including active credit monitoring and quantitative sector analysis 
the company also addresses credit risk by investing primarily in investments with ratings of a a or higher or which are collateralized by federal agency securities  as well as ensuring proper diversification of the portfolio by limiting individual investments to one percent of the total portfolio 
approximately percent of the company s investment portfolio at december  consists of securities with an a or better rating 
the company manages its credit risk related to its derivative financial instruments by entering into agreements only with major financial institutions and regularly monitoring the credit ratings of these financial institutions 
due to the nature of our business  the vast majority of our global funds transfer business is conducted through independent agents 
our agents receive the proceeds from the sale of our payment instruments and we must then collect these funds from the agents 
as a result  we have credit exposure to our agents  which averages approximately billion  representing a combination of money orders  money transfers and bill payment proceeds 
this credit exposure is spread across almost  agents  of which owe us in excess of million each at any one time 
agents typically have from one to three days to remit the funds  with longer remittance schedules granted to international agents and certain domestic agents under certain circumstances 
the company assesses the creditworthiness of each potential agent before accepting it into our distribution network 
the company actively monitors the credit risk of our agents on an on going basis by conducting periodic comprehensive financial reviews and cash flow analysis of our agents who average high volumes of money order sales 
in addition  the company frequently takes additional steps to minimize agent credit risk  such as requiring owner guarantees  corporate guarantees and other forms of security where appropriate 
the company monitors remittance patterns versus reported sales by agent on a daily basis 
the company also utilizes software embedded in each point of sale terminal to control both the number and dollar amount of money orders sold 
this software also allows the company to monitor for suspicious transactions or volumes of sales  assisting the company in uncovering irregularities such as money laundering  fraud or agent self use 
finally  the company has the ability to remotely disable money order dispensers or transaction devices to prevent agents from issuing money orders or performing money transfers if suspicious activity is noted or remittances are not received according to the agent s contract 
the point of sale software requires each location to be re authorized on a daily basis for transaction processing 
foreign currency exchange risk foreign currency exchange risk represents the potential adverse effect on the company s earnings from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates affecting certain receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
the company is primarily affected by fluctuations in the us dollar as compared to the british pound and the euro 
the foreign currency exposure that does exist is limited by the fact that foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are generally very short term in nature 
the company primarily utilizes forward contracts to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates 
these forward contracts generally have maturities of less than thirty days 
the forward contracts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets  and the net effect of changes in exchange rates and the related forward contracts is not significant 
had the british pound and euro appreciated relative to the us dollar twenty percent over actual exchange rates for  pre tax operating income would have increased million for the year 
had the british pound and euro depreciated twenty percent over actual rates for  pretax operating income would have decreased million for the year 
this sensitivity analysis considers both the impact on translation of our foreign denominated revenue and expense streams and the impact on our hedging program 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions and estimates to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and that require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
based on these criteria  management has identified and discussed with the audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates  and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates fair value of investment securities our investment securities are classified as available for sale  including securities being held for indefinite periods of time and those securities that may be sold to assist in the clearing of payment service obligations or in the management of securities 
these securities are carried at market value or fair value  with the net after tax unrealized gain or loss reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
fair value is generally based on quoted market prices 
certain investment securities are not readily marketable 
as a result  the fair value of these investments is based on cash flow projections that require a significant degree of management judgment as to default and recovery rates of the underlying investments 
accordingly  the estimates determined may not be indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
in general  as interest rates increase  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio and stockholders equity decreases and as interest rates fall  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio increases  along with stockholders equity 
other than temporary impairment securities with gross unrealized losses at the consolidated balance sheet date are subjected to the company s process for identifying other than temporary impairments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 views on accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities 
the company writes down to fair value securities that it deems to be other than temporarily impaired in the period the securities are deemed to be impaired 
under sfas no 
 the assessment of whether such impairment has occurred is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
the company regularly monitors its investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely manner and that any impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period 
pursuant to the company s impairment review process  changes in individual security values are regularly monitored to identify potential impairment indicators 
the process includes a monthly review of all securities using a screening process to identify those securities for which fair value falls below established thresholds for certain time periods  or which are identified through other monitoring criteria such as ratings downgrades 
a monthly meeting is held to discuss those securities identified by the screening process 
based on this meeting  management makes an assessment as to whether any of the securities are other than temporarily impaired 
in making this assessment  management considers both quantitative and qualitative information  as well as the company s intent and ability to hold an investment to recovery 
if the company does not have the intent or the ability to hold the investment until recovery  an investment with a fair value less than its carrying value will be deemed other than temporarily impaired 
assessment factors considered by management include  but are not limited to  the following expected ability of the investment to recover its original cost  expected time frame to recovery  deterioration in actual and or anticipated cash flows from the investment  
table of contents extent of and length of time the investment has been in an unrealized loss position  deterioration in the issuer s credit rating and or the industry and geographical area in which the issuer operates  anticipated investment portfolio rebalancing activities in response to environmental changes  failure of asset backed securities to meet minimum coverage or collateralization tests  new information regarding the investment or the issuer  anticipated cash flow needs of the company  including anticipated acquisitions and customer contract terminations  and the sufficiency of anticipated cash and cash equivalent balances to meet these needs  and other qualitative factors applicable to the investment in question 
in connection with anticipated dispositions to adjust the portfolio for duration or for asset allocation  the company analyzes its investment portfolio to recognize impairments for securities in an unrealized loss position for which the company no longer has the intent and ability to hold to recovery as a result of the analysis of the factors listed above 
the company evaluates investments for beneficial interests in structured investments rated a and below for which risk of credit loss is deemed more than remote for impairment under eitf issue no 
when an adverse change in expected cash flows occurs  and if the fair value of a security is less that its carrying value  the investment is written down to fair value 
any security deemed to be other than temporarily impaired is written down to its then current market value  with the amount of the write down reflected in the company s consolidated statement of income for that quarter 
the company s methodology to identify potential impairments requires professional judgment 
there are inherent risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments 
changes in circumstances and critical assumptions such as a continued weak economy  a more pronounced economic downturn or unforeseen events which affect one or more companies  industry sectors or countries could result in additional write downs in future periods for impairments that are deemed other than temporary 
the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions  the issuer s financial condition or near term recovery prospects  the effects of changes in interest rates  the length of time and the extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost and the company s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
in addition  for securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows eg asset backed securities  projections of expected future cash flows may change based upon new information regarding the performance of the underlying collateral 
we recorded million  million and million of other than temporary impairment losses in  and  respectively  primarily related to other asset backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and structured notes held in our investment portfolio 
during  and  we received million  million and million in cash recoveries on previously impaired securities 
at december    and  our investment portfolio has unrealized losses of million  million and million  respectively 
adverse changes in estimated cash flows in the future could result in impairment losses to the extent that the recorded value of such investments exceeds fair value for a period deemed to be other than temporary 
derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are used as part of our risk management strategy to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes 
derivatives are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its related amendments and interpretations 
the derivatives are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value  with the change in fair value recognized in earnings or in other comprehensive income depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
a derivative that does not qualify  or is not designated  as a hedge will be reflected at fair value  with changes in value recognized through earnings 
the estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments has been determined using available market information and certain valuation methodologies 
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates determined may not be indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 

table of contents at december   moneygram has million of unrealized losses on derivative financial instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
while moneygram intends to continue to meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 if hedges did not qualify as highly effective or if forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring or did not occur  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings 
moneygram does not believe it is exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in its hedging activities as the counterparties are generally well established  well capitalized financial institutions 
goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires annual impairment testing of goodwill based on the estimated fair value of moneygram s reporting units 
the fair value of moneygram s reporting units is estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital rate 
additionally  an assumed terminal value is used to project future cash flows beyond base years 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected cash flows  terminal values and the discount rate require considerable judgment and are based on historical experience  financial forecasts  and industry trends and conditions 
we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the years presented 
pension obligations on december   moneygram adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  which requires recognition of the funded status of pension plans in the balance sheet 
unrecognized prior service costs and gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income 
moneygram provides defined benefit pension plan coverage to certain employees of moneygram  as well as former employees of viad and of sold operations of viad 
pension benefits and the related expense income are based upon actuarial assumptions regarding mortality  discount rates  long term return on assets and other factors 
moneygram s discount rate used in determining future pension obligations is measured on november measurement date and is based on rates determined by actuarial analysis and management review 
following are the assumptions used to measure the projected benefit obligation as of december  and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december net periodic benefit cost discount rate expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase projected benefit obligation discount rate rate of compensation increase moneygram s pension expense for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
pension expense is calculated in part based upon the actuarial assumptions shown above 
at each measurement date  the discount rate is based on interest rates for high quality  long term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to our liabilities 
the expected return on pension plan assets is based on our historical experience  our pension plan investment strategy and our expectations for long term rates of return 
current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long term capital market assumptions are determined 
peer data and historical returns are reviewed for reasonableness and appropriateness 
our pension plan investment strategy is reviewed annually and is based upon plan liabilities  an evaluation of market conditions  tolerance for risk  and cash requirements for benefit payments 
moneygram s asset allocation at december  consists of approximately percent in large capitalization and international equity stock funds  approximately percent in fixed income securities such as global bond funds and corporate obligations  approximately percent in a real estate limited partnership interest and less than percent in other securities 
the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed 
table of contents income securities 
investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews and annual liability measurements 
our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management s best judgment regarding future expectations 
some of these assumptions require significant management judgment and could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension obligation 
future actual pension income or expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in moneygram s pension plans 
the discount rates used to determine benefit obligation and pension expense are reviewed on an annual basis 
lowering the discount rate by basis points would have increased pension expense by million  while increasing the discount rate by basis points would have decreased pension expense by million 
moneygram s pension assets are primarily invested in marketable securities that have readily determinable current market values 
moneygram s investments are rebalanced regularly to stay within the investment guidelines 
moneygram reviews the expected rate of return in connection with significant changes in the pension asset allocation  the investing strategy or in inflation and interest rates 
the actual rate of return on average pension assets in was percent  as compared to the expected rate of return of percent 
as the expected rate of return is a long term assumption and the widely accepted capital market principle is that assets with higher volatility generate greater long term returns  we do not believe that the actual return for one year is significantly different from the expected return used to determine the benefit obligation 
changing the expected rate of return by basis points would have increased decreased pension expense by million
