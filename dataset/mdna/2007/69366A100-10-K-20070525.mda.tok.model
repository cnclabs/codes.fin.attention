critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  including the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the company periodically evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare its financial statements  which are then reviewed by the company s audit committee 
management s estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions considered reasonable with the relevant facts and circumstances 
based on the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ 
the critical accounting policies and estimates are those policies that relate to estimates that require the company s management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and could have a material impact on the company s results due to changes in the estimates or the use of different estimates that could reasonably have been used 
additionally  the company includes those accounting policies whose initial application had a material impact on the company s financial presentation  unless the policy s application resulted solely from the issuance of new accounting literature 
the discussion below applies to each of the company s reportable segments physician business  elder care business  and corporate shared services  unless otherwise noted 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from the sale of consumable products  equipment  software solutions and other services 
revenue from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped by a third party common carrier or delivered by the company s vehicle since at that time there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  and the collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of equipment is generally recognized when the equipment is shipped  unless there are multiple deliverables  in which case revenue is recognized when all obligations to the customer are fulfilled 
obligations to the customer are typically satisfied when installation and training are complete 
during fiscal year  the physician business increased its sales in software solutions  which included sales of third party proprietary software 
as a result  the company began applying the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf in determining whether it is appropriate to record either i the gross amount of product sales in revenue and related costs in cost of goods sold or ii the net amount earned as a commission in revenue net reporting 
this determination requires management to evaluate the terms of relevant supplier contracts and other criteria  including determining the primary obligor in a transaction and which party bears general inventory risk  among 
table of contents other factors 
based on this evaluation  management determined that certain transactions relating to the sale of third party proprietary software required net reporting 
net sales  gross margins  and operating margins may be impacted in future periods to the extent the company s revenues expand into areas that require net reporting of revenue in accordance with eitf the company s revenue recognition processes involve establishing sales allowances for estimated returns  damaged goods  and other revenue adjustments 
these estimates are based on historical experience and the facts known at the date of preparation of the financial statements 
sales allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue for estimated product and equipment returns and other revenue adjustments 
management estimates product returns and other revenue adjustments using historical data adjusted for significant changes in volume and business conditions 
in the last three years  the company s sales allowances have reduced its gross revenue by less than 
if actual adjustments significantly exceeded estimated amounts  it would result in materially lower revenue and net income balances in one or more periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability to collect outstanding amounts due from its customers 
the allowances include specific amounts for those accounts that are likely to be uncollectible  such as bankruptcies  and general allowances for those accounts that management currently believes to be collectible but later become uncollectible 
estimates are used to determine the allowances for doubtful accounts and are based on historical collection experience  current economic trends  credit worthiness of customers  and changes in customer payment terms 
the percentage of each aging category that is reserved is determined by analyzing historical write offs and current trends in the credit quality of the customer base 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations by reviewing the customer s current financial information 
adjustments to credit limits and allowances for bad debts are made based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate or improve  allowances may be adjusted which will impact general and administrative expenses and accounts receivable 
over the past three years  the company s allowance for doubtful accounts has represented between and of the physician business gross accounts receivable balance and between and of the elder care business gross accounts receivable balance 
inventories in order to state inventories medical products  medical equipment  and other related products at the lower of cost determined using the first in  first out fifo method or market net realizable value  the company maintains an allowance for excess or slow moving inventory based on the expectation that some inventory will become obsolete and be sold for less than cost or become unsaleable altogether 
the allowance is estimated based on factors such as historical trends  current market conditions and management s assessment of when the inventory would likely be sold and the quantities and prices at which the inventory would likely be sold in the normal course of business 
changes in product specifications  customer product preferences or the loss of a customer could result in unanticipated impairment in net realizable value that may have a material impact on cost of goods sold  gross margin and net income 
obsolete or damaged inventory is disposed of or written down to net realizable value on a quarterly basis 
additional adjustments  if necessary  are made based on management s specific review of inventory on hand 
as part of the company s periodic review of the carrying amount of inventory during the three months ended december   management determined that a write down of million was required for excess influenza vaccine inventory resulting from the cancellation of customer orders during the third quarter of fiscal year due to an oversupply of the product in the market  and a mild influenza season 
in addition to these factors  management based its decision on the likelihood of locating alternate markets for the product and the viability of the product based on its limited life span 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company sold a marginal amount of its excess influenza inventory  resulting in a remaining write down of million at 
table of contents march  as a result of the write down  cost of goods sold were increased by million during the fiscal year ended march   or million net of tax 
vendor rebates the company receives transaction based and performance based rebates from third party suppliers 
such rebates are classified as either i a reduction to cost of goods sold  ii a reduction of cost  or iii an increase to net sales in the accompanying statements of operations 
transaction based rebates are generally associated with a specific customer contract and are recognized as a reduction to cost of goods sold at the time the transaction occurs 
management establishes a reserve for uncollectible transaction based vendor rebates based on management s judgment after considering the status of current outstanding rebate claims  historical denial experience with suppliers  and any other pertinent available information 
performance based rebates are recognized based on a systematic estimation of the consideration to be received relative to the transaction that marks the progress of the company toward earning vendor rebates  provided the collection of the amounts is  in the judgment of management  reasonably assured 
the factors the company considers in estimating performance based rebates include forecasted inventory purchases or sales volumes  in conjunction with vendor rebate contract terms  which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume 
performance based rebates are recognized in income only if the related inventory has been sold 
although the company believes its judgments  estimates and or assumptions related to vendor rebates are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions could materially affect the company s financial results 
income taxes the liability method is used for determining income taxes  under which current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  management considers and makes judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
these estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require management to adjust the valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets generally depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions 
the company had deferred income tax assets of million and million at march  and march   respectively 
there were no valuation allowances as of march  and march   as management believes it will ultimately utilize the company s deferred tax assets 
the company s tax filings are periodically subjected to audit by the internal revenue service irs and other taxing authorities  which may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts 
resolution of these situations inevitably includes some degree of uncertainty  accordingly  the company provides taxes only for the amounts management believes will ultimately result from these proceedings 
management does not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to the tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors  which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among others  i the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by federal  state  and local tax authorities  ii the willingness of federal  state  and local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative 
table of contents process  and iii the impartiality of the federal  state  and local courts 
management s experience has been that the estimates and assumptions used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate 
however  past experience is only a guide  and the potential exists  however limited  that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amount accrued 
during the three months ended december   the provision for income taxes was reduced approximately million as a result of a settlement agreement between the company and the appeals office of the irs 
refer to note  income taxes  for a further discussion 
the settlement agreement was subject to final review and approval by the congressional joint committee on taxation the joint committee 
in october  the company received written notification that the joint committee has found no exception to the settlement agreement reached with the appeals office of the irs 
estimating useful lives of property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the following estimated useful lives 
useful life equipment to years capitalized internal use software costs to years computer hardware and software to years leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives 
management must use judgment in determining the estimated useful lives of its assets 
changes in circumstances  such as technological advances  changes to the company s business model  changes in the company s business strategy  or changes in the planned use of property and equipment  could result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s current estimates 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened or extended  the company would depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated salvage value over its revised remaining useful life 
during fiscal year  management reviewed the estimated useful lives of certain computer hardware and software in connection with completing the implementation of the jd edwards enterprise resource planning erp system 
based on this review  management revised the estimated useful lives of certain assets after considering i the company s historical use of its prior erp systems  ii future plans for the jd edwards erp system  iii expected enhancements  and iv expected ongoing product support  enhancements  and maintenance commitments from the supplier 
management believed this change in estimate was appropriate given the company s commitment to and invested capital in the customization and future use of the jd edwards erp platform 
as a result  the remaining estimated useful lives of certain computer hardware and software with a carrying value of approximately million were extended on march  to coincide with the expected service life of the assets in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes 
the weighted average remaining useful life of the assets prior to the change in estimate was approximately months and the change in estimate lengthened the estimated useful lives by approximately months 
this change in estimate decreased depreciation expense million  net of tax  or approximately of diluted earnings per share  for the fiscal year ended march  and million  net of tax  or approximately of diluted earnings per share  for the fiscal year ended march  notes receivable notes receivable consist of amounts owed to the company and are stated at cost  which approximates fair value 
the company s outstanding notes receivable are exposed to credit risk and valuation allowances are established for estimated losses resulting from non collection of outstanding amounts 
the valuation allowances include specific amounts for those notes considered uncollectible and general allowances for delinquent notes 
specific 
table of contents allowances are provided for unsecured notes deemed uncollectible based on facts and circumstances known to management  such as the financial condition of the note holder 
estimates are used to determine the general valuation allowances and are generally based on historical collection results  the current status of the notes  and the credit worthiness of the note holders 
management reviews the adequacy of the valuation allowances for notes receivable on a periodic basis and adjustments are made  if needed  based on current facts and circumstances known at the valuation date 
the company has two notes receivable the loans  which bear interest at the applicable federal rate for long term obligations  outstanding from its former chairman and chief executive officer 
one loan is unsecured and the other loan is secured by a split dollar life insurance policy 
management reviews the realization of the loans on a quarterly basis based on current facts and circumstances known at the valuation date 
as part of the company s periodic review of the carrying amount of the loans during the three months ended september   management and the board of directors determined that an allowance for doubtful accounts of million was required on the unsecured loan after communication with the former chairman and chief executive officer regarding his financial condition and other due diligence procedures performed by management 
subsequently  during the three months ended july   new facts and circumstances were obtained by management and the board of directors that indicated the former chairman and chief executive officer s financial condition had improved 
in addition  the company received a payment of approximately million during this period for past due interest 
these factors  as well as direct communication with the former chairman and chief executive officer during this period  led to a determination by management and the board of directors that the allowance for doubtful accounts was no longer required for the unsecured loan 
therefore  general and administrative expenses were reduced million during the three months ended july   which increased net income million 
legal contingencies the company is party to various legal and administrative proceedings and claims arising in the normal course of business

 accounting for contingencies  if information prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be estimated  an accrual for a loss contingency is established 
if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met  or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued  disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred 
management does not believe the outstanding legal proceedings at march   will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in management s assumptions related to the anticipated or actual outcome of any outstanding legal proceedings 
during fiscal year  the company settled a class action lawsuit pursuant to which the company was required to pay million  of which approximately million was accrued for during fiscal year  to cover the uninsured losses and professional fees to resolve all claims

impairment of goodwill  intangibles  and other long lived assets the company allocates the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in the valuation of acquired intangible assets include  but are not limited to i expected future cash flows from existing 
table of contents customer contracts and relationships  ii assumptions relating to the impact of noncompete agreements on business operations  iii assumptions related to the impact on the timing of expected future cash flows  iv retention of customers and key business leaders  and v the risk inherent in investing in intangible assets 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption  estimates  or other actual results 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but instead must be tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas 
sfas requires that long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner of the use of the underlying assets  and iii significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
nonsolicitation payments made to certain sales representatives are tested annually or more frequently for impairment in accordance with sfas certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment of the nonsolicitation agreements exists include  but are not limited to i a change in a state s legal system that would impact any legal opinion relied upon when assessing enforceability of the nonsolicitation covenants  ii a decline in gross profit generated by a sales representative below the amount that the nonsolicitation was based upon  iii death of a sales representative  or iv full retirement by the sales representative 
in the event that the carrying value of assets are determined to be unrecoverable  the company would estimate the fair value of the assets or reporting unit and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
in conducting the impairment test  the company determines the fair value of its reporting units using valuation techniques which can include a discounted cash flow analysis that requires management to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  revenues  earnings  and other factors  including discount rates  to determine the fair value of these respective assets 
the application of different assumptions about such matters as estimated future cash flows or discount rates  or the testing for impairment at a different level of the organization or on a different organization structure  could produce materially different results 
management does not believe there were any circumstances which indicated that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable during fiscal year recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company s objective in managing market risk exposures is to identify and limit the potential impact of changes in interest rates  commodity availability  and access of capital on earnings and cash flow 
the following assessment of the company s market risk does not include uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political uncertainty  economic uncertainty  impact of future tax legislation  and credit risks 
interest rate risk 
the company s primary interest rate exposure relates to cash and cash equivalents and fixed and variable rate debt 
during fiscal year  the company s debt obligations consisted of i million convertible senior notes with a fixed rate of and ii variable rate borrowings under the revolving line of credit  which bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus an applicable margin based on availability of borrowings  or at libor plus an applicable margin based on availability of borrowings 
availability of borrowings depends upon a borrowing base calculation consisting of accounts receivable and inventory  subject to satisfaction of certain eligibility requirements less any outstanding letters of credit 
changes in interest rates affect interest payments under the company s variable rate revolving line of credit agreement 
during fiscal years and  the company maintained an interest rate swap agreement that matured on march   with a notional amount during the period that covered a portion of variable rate borrowings and which effectively fixed the notional amount covered by the swap at a borrowing rate of plus a credit spread 
on march   the company had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit and million outstanding in fixed rate convertible senior notes 
although the company s outstanding debt is primarily fixed  a hypothetical interest rate increase of basis points would affect annual interest expense by million based on borrowings outstanding at march  changes in interest rates also affect rates of return on the company s cash equivalents and short term investments  which generally consist of money market accounts 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of basis points would result in a potential reduction in future pre tax earnings of approximately million per year for every million of short term investments 
due to the short term nature of the company s investments  typically less than day maturities  the impact of a similar basis point change in interest rates would have an immaterial impact on the carrying value of an investment 
currency risk 
the company s currency rate exposures relate to products that are globally sourced from manufacturers primarily in southeast asia 
currently  the company has negotiated settlement of payments to 
table of contents manufacturers in us dollars 
however  over time  local country currency fluctuations may increase or decrease the negotiated cost that the company must pay for these products 
in addition  the company may in future periods negotiate settlement of payments to manufacturers in the local currency of the country providing a product which would then subject the company to foreign currency risk 
based on current global purchases  a hypothetical change in the currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations 
commodity risk 
the company s primary commodity exposures relate to fluctuations in the price of gasoline and diesel fuel and the procurement of certain medical supplies in which the product cost is dependent upon the price of raw materials  primarily latex and vinyl 
the company s direct fuel exposure relates to fluctuations in fuel costs that affect the company leased delivery fleet or third party carrier delivery charges 
significant increases in the cost of gasoline and diesel fuel have impacted  and may continue to impact  the company s gross margin  cost to deliver  and the operating costs of common carriers 
some of these common carriers have passed these increases through to the company in the form of a fuel surcharge  which has had an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company implemented a fuel surcharge during fiscal year to offset a portion of the increased cost of gasoline and diesel fuel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to fully pass along further significant increases in fuel costs to its customers due to the competitive nature of the medical supply distribution industry 
the company purchases latex and vinyl gloves in which the pricing of the gloves is based on the price of raw wet latex as traded on the malaysian rubber exchange and the weighted price of two raw materials  poly vinyl chloride pvc and dioctylphthalate dop  as published on www 
icis 
com 
based on current purchasing levels  a hypothetical change in the price of these raw materials would not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations
