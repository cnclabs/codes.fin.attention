item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview description of the business the company primarily franchises and operates mcdonald s restaurants 
in addition  the company operates and has investments in certain non mcdonald s brands that are not material to the company s overall results 
of the  mcdonald s restaurants in countries at year end   are operated by franchisees including  operated by developmental licensees   are operated by affiliates and  are operated by the company 
under our conventional franchise arrangement  franchisees provide a portion of the required capital by initially investing in the equipment  signs  seating and d cor of their restaurant businesses  and by reinvesting in the business over time 
the company owns the land and building or secures long term leases for both company operated and franchised restaurant sites 
this ensures long term occupancy rights  helps control related costs and improves alignment with franchisees 
under our developmental license arrangement  licensees provide ongoing capital for the entire business  including the real estate interest  while the company generally has no capital invested 
we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and continually review our restaurant ownership mix that is our mix among company operated  franchised conventional or developmental license  and joint venture to deliver a great customer experience and drive profitability 
in most cases  franchising is the best way to achieve both goals 
although direct restaurant operation is more capital intensive relative to franchising and results in lower operating margins as a percent of revenues  company operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets 
in our company operated restaurants  and in collaboration with our franchisees  we further develop and refine operating standards  marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies  so that we introduce systemwide only those that we believe are most beneficial 
in addition  we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor 
our company operated business also helps to facilitate changes in restaurant ownership as warranted by strategic considerations 
revenues consist of sales by company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates 
these fees primarily include rent  service fees and or royalties that are based on a percent of sales  with specified minimum rent payments 
fees vary by type of site  amount of company investment and local business conditions 
these fees  along with occupancy and operating rights  are stipulated in franchise license agreements that generally have year terms 
the business is managed as distinct geographic segments united states  europe  asia pacific  middle east and africa apmea  latin america  and canada 
in addition  throughout this report we present a segment entitled corporate other that includes corporate activities and non mcdonald s brands eg  boston market 
the eg and europe segments each account for approximately of total revenues 
france  germany and the united kingdom uk  collectively  account for approximately of europe s revenues  and australia  china and japan a owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method  collectively  account for nearly of apmea s revenues 
these six markets along with the us and canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise approximately of total revenues 
during  the company disposed of its entire investment in chipotle mexican grill chipotle via public stock offerings and a tax free exchange for mcdonald s common stock 
as a result of the complete disposition of chipotle  the company has reflected chipotle s results for all years shown as discontinued operations  including gains from the disposition in in analyzing business trends  management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including comparable sales growth  systemwide sales growth  operating margins and returns 
constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates 
management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain compensation plans on these results because we believe they better represent the underlying business trends 
comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the company s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends 
increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all mcdonald s restaurants in operation at least thirteen months  including those temporarily closed 
some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include road construction  reimaging or remodeling  and natural disasters 
mcdonald s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month  quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days 
the number of weekdays  weekend days and timing of holidays in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales 
the company refers to this impact as the calendar shift trading day adjustment 
this impact varies geographically due to consumer spending patterns and has the greatest impact on monthly comparable sales 
typically  the annual impact is minimal  with the exception of leap years 
systemwide sales include sales at all mcdonald s and boston market restaurants  whether operated by the company  by franchisees or by affiliates 
while sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the company  management believes the information is important in understanding the company s financial performance because it is the basis on which the company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and is indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base 
return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units  the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital 
the return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization numerator by the adjusted cash used for investing activities denominator  primarily capital expenditures 
the calculation assumes a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation 

table of contents strategic direction and financial performance the unique business relationship among the company  its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system has been key to mcdonald s success over the years 
this business model enables mcdonald s to play an integral role in the communities we serve and consistently deliver relevant restaurant experiences to customers 
in addition  our strategic alignment facilitates our ability to implement innovative ideas and profitably grow our business 
the company is focused on increasing mcdonald s relevance to consumers through the execution of multiple initiatives under our plan to win in order to be better  not just bigger 
this plan is designed to deliver operational excellence and leadership marketing leveraged around five key drivers of exceptional customer experiences people  products  place  price and promotion 
our long term financial targets include average annual systemwide sales and revenue growth of to  average annual operating income growth of to  and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens 
these targets exclude the impact of foreign currency translation 
since implementing our plan to win  we improved the taste of many of our menu items and have introduced a variety of new menu choices such as premium salads  premium burgers and additional chicken offerings in many markets worldwide 
we appeal to a broad range of customer preferences using a locally relevant three tier menu strategy featuring premium salad and sandwich selections  classic menu favorites and everyday affordable offerings 
we strive for continuous improvement in our training programs and restaurant execution through a comprehensive restaurant operations improvement process to enable and motivate franchisees and restaurant employees to improve the customer experience 
in addition  our i m lovin it global marketing theme continues to evolve to extend our marketing reach to consumers via print  billboards and digital communications in addition to television advertising 
these efforts have increased our consumer relevance and delivered strong results in each of the last three years with revenue growth  operating income growth and returns on incremental invested capital meeting or exceeding our long term financial targets 
in addition  we demonstrated our commitment to shareholders by returning billion to shareholders through dividends paid and shares acquired from through in  the company s increased relevance contributed to more customers visiting our restaurants  helping drive global comparable sales up and extending our consecutive monthly increases to months through december the momentum of our us business continued as a result of further strengthening our robust breakfast business and expanding our beverage  salad and chicken offerings  including the successful introductions of premium roast coffee  the asian salad and the snack wrap 
initiatives such as reimaging restaurants  extending operating hours and providing cashless payment options helped make mcdonald s more inviting and convenient for customers 
in europe  we built momentum using locally relevant menu offerings such as premium burgers and classic menu favorites  as well as value platforms such as ein mal eins in germany and pound saver in the uk the markets provided predictable menu choice and variety through popular food promotions  and engaged consumers with innovative marketing 
europe s results were driven by strong performance in france  germany and most other markets as well as significantly improved performance in the uk we also made progress improving consumer perceptions in europe  including the uk  by aggressively communicating mcdonald s food quality  nutrition and employment facts 
in addition  to enhance local relevance by having local franchisees operate more restaurants and to improve returns  we reduced our percentage of company operated restaurants in the uk from at the end of to at the end of we are encouraged by our momentum in europe and confident that our combined initiatives designed to enhance the customers experience will continue to drive growth over the long term 
in apmea  systemwide sales and revenue growth were primarily driven by strong comparable sales in japan and australia and new restaurant expansion and positive comparable sales in china 
strategic menu pricing in japan and china contributed to this segment s performance 
in  we also entered into a strategic alliance with sinopec  china s largest petroleum retailer 
this agreement provides us the opportunity to co develop drive thru restaurants at existing and new sinopec locations  positioning us to capitalize on changing consumer lifestyles in china 
we believe that the long term growth potential for our business in china is substantial and we are well positioned to capture the opportunity 
we continue to focus our management and financial resources on the core mcdonald s business as the opportunities for growth remain significant 
accordingly  during  we disposed of our entire investment in chipotle via public stock offerings and an october tax free exchange for mcdonald s common stock 
these transactions provided the company with million in cash proceeds and facilitated the acquisition of million shares of mcdonald s stock via the exchange 
in  our strong global performance generated billion of cash provided by operations 
about billion of this cash was reinvested in our business primarily to remodel existing restaurants and build new ones 
we increased our annual dividend nearly to per share 
we also acquired million shares through both shares repurchased and shares accepted in connection with the chipotle exchange 
in addition  we paid down billion of debt in reducing the increase related to the homeland investment act 
to improve local relevance  profitability and returns  we continually evaluate ownership structures in our markets 
the ownership mix in a given market depends on current and potential results  the risks associated with operating in certain countries  and legal and regulatory constraints 
as part of this evaluation  in  we established a target of having less than company operated restaurants in each of our major consolidated markets and began working toward this goal  specifically in the uk and canada 
for certain markets like china  we believe owning and operating the restaurants is prudent until the legal environment in these countries becomes more conducive to franchising 
in addition to our franchising efforts discussed above  we have identified markets with about  restaurants collectively  primarily company operated restaurants in latin america and apmea  that we intend to transition to a developmental license structure 
under a developmental license  a local entrepreneur owns the business  including controlling the real estate  and uses his her capital and local knowledge to build the brand and optimize sales and profitability over the long term 
under this arrangement  the company collects a royalty  which varies by market  based on a percent of sales  but does not invest any capital 
during  this royalty averaged about five percent of sales 
we have successfully used this structure for more than years  and currently have countries that are solely operated by developmental licensees 
in addition to the financial benefits the company achieves when markets are developmentally licensed 
table of contents such as reduced capital spending  improved returns and a stable stream of royalties  this strategy allows the local owner to improve relevance and accelerate growth in the market  and allows management to focus most of their time and energy on the markets that have the largest impact on results 
highlights from the year included comparable sales increased building on a increase in systemwide sales increased both as reported and in constant currencies 
consolidated revenues increased in constant currencies 
income from continuing operations per common share was compared with in  an increase of 
cash provided by operations totaled billion and capital expenditures totaled billion 
the company increased the annual dividend nearly to per share  or billion in total 
the company also acquired million shares for billion  driving a reduction of about of total shares outstanding at year end compared with one year roiic was and three year roiic was for outlook for the mcdonald s system is energized by our current momentum 
we intend to build on this momentum by further enhancing every element of the brand experience and strengthening our connection with customers to capture the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead 
we will do this by continuing to execute our plan to win with a strategic focus on our customers and restaurants  while continuing to exercise disciplined financial management 
we are confident that our plan to be better  not just bigger  supported by the alignment of our unique system of franchisees and suppliers  will continue to drive enduring profitable growth 
our financial targets  previously discussed  focus management on those opportunities that best optimize shareholder value over the long term 
in  we will continue to leverage our three tier menu approach featuring premium selections  core menu favorites and everyday affordable offerings to appeal to a broad range of consumers 
we will complement this three tier strategy with permanent and limited time offerings of new products that enhance menu choice  variety and value 
in the us  our strategies focus on chicken  breakfast  beverages and convenience 
we are introducing snack wrap variations and the new southwest salad as well as additional breakfast offerings 
we will also enhance the drive thru experience by continuing to optimize the layout of restaurant interiors and exteriors 
in europe  we will continue to attract customers with a variety of new food offerings  such as premium chicken sandwiches and snack wraps  while leveraging the strength of our everyday affordability platforms 
building greater brand trust will remain a priority in europe with ongoing aggressive communication efforts surrounding our food quality  nutrition and employment image 
in addition  we will focus on remodeling restaurants and improving operations to enhance local relevance and upgrade the customer experience 
in apmea  where a large percentage of the population already eats breakfast away from home  we are introducing or expanding breakfast as well as extending restaurant operating hours 
we will also continue to reinforce everyday value offerings and work on optimizing our menu pricing structure to enhance profitability 
we will continue to support consumers desire to make balanced lifestyle choices by educating them about our food s nutritional value and encouraging greater physical activity 
we added nutrition labeling to the packaging of many of our branded core menu items in more than  restaurants worldwide by the end of we will extend this effort to cover even more restaurants and products in we will also continue to play a leadership role in addressing children s well being as we pursue initiatives designed to positively affect children s choice and activity 
this includes committing a large portion of our children s marketing budget toward communications that encourage kids to be more active physically and mentally 
we will also work to further enhance the customer experience by refining and executing our restaurant operations improvement process and expanding the use of our new point of sale software pos  which was in approximately  restaurants as of year end tests indicate this new pos helps improve order accuracy and drive thru service speed 
in addition  we will continue developing a new flexible operating system that takes a modular plug and play approach to kitchen configuration and restaurant operations 
in the future  this system will enable greater menu flexibility based on local market needs while making it easier for crew to satisfy customers 
due to our expectations for continued strong results  relatively stable capital expenditures over the next few years  and the company s intent on maintaining current debt to capital levels of to  we believe that cash available for dividends and share repurchases will continue to grow 
we expect our share repurchase activity will continue to yield reductions in share count in the years ahead given our reduction in equity compensation and fewer stock options outstanding  compared to prior years 
in  we will continue to reduce the percentage of company operated restaurants in the uk and canada  and we will continue to pursue the developmental license strategy described earlier 
the previously mentioned  restaurants identified for potential conversion to developmental licensees represented nearly billion in sales in  but only generated million in operating income after impairment and other charges 
to achieve these results  we spent about million in selling  general administrative expenses and invested more than million in capital expenditures 
as appropriate  we may license some of these markets as a group to a single developmental licensee 
these  restaurants are about company operated and represent about billion in combined net investment  which includes approximately million in accumulated currency translation losses reflected in shareholders equity on our balance sheet 
our intent is to complete these transactions by the end of if we are able to complete these transactions  we do not anticipate recovering either the million in historical currency translation losses or most of the remaining billion in net book value in the form of sales proceeds  and therefore  we expect that the loss  in the aggregate  would be significant 
we will continue impairment testing for these assets annually and as otherwise required by applicable accounting standards 
in particular  our annual impairment testing for these assets is based on the assumption that these markets will continue to be operated under the existing ownership structure until it becomes probable that a transaction will occur within months  and we can reasonably estimate our sales proceeds 
the timing and amount of any loss for a particular transaction will depend on individual circumstances 
in  we completed the transfer of restaurants in four markets to developmental licensees and recorded pretax losses totaling million related to this strategy 

table of contents while the company does not provide specific guidance on net income per share  the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the company s results changes in systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion 
the company expects net restaurant additions to add slightly more than percentage point to systemwide sales growth in constant currencies  most of which will be due to the net traditional mcdonald s restaurants added during in  the company expects to open about mcdonald s restaurants traditional and satellites 
we expect net additions of about net traditional additions and net satellite closings 
the company does not provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales 
however  as a perspective  assuming no change in cost structure  a percentage point increase in us comparable sales would increase annual net income per share by about cents 
similarly  an increase of percentage point in europe s comparable sales would increase annual net income per share by about cents 
the primary food commodities impacting mcdonald s business are beef and chicken 
in  us beef costs are expected to be down slightly  while we expect us chicken costs to rise 
in europe  both beef and chicken costs are expected to increase slightly in the company expects full year selling  general administrative expenses to decline modestly as a percent of revenues and systemwide sales compared with a significant part of the company s operating income is generated outside the us  and about of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the euro and the british pound 
if the euro and the british pound both move in the same direction compared with  the company s annual net income per share would change by about cents to cents 
in  based on current business performance and plans  the company expects to maintain a debt to capital ratio of to 
based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates  the company expects interest expense in to remain relatively flat compared with  while it expects interest income to decrease about to due to lower cash balances 
the company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year to be approximately to  although some volatility may be experienced between the quarters in the normal course of business 
the company expects capital expenditures for to be approximately billion 
about half of this amount will be reinvested in existing restaurants while the rest will primarily be used to build new restaurants 
in  the company returned nearly billion to shareholders 
in and combined  the company expects to return at least an additional billion through a combination of share repurchases and dividends

supplemental information regarding company operated mcdonald s restaurants we continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance  profits and returns 
in most cases  franchising is the best way to achieve these goals 
although direct 
table of contents restaurant operation is significantly more capital intensive relative to franchising and results in lower operating margins as a percent of revenues  company operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets 
in our company operated restaurants  we develop and refine operating standards  marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies  so that we introduce systemwide only those that we believe are most beneficial 
in addition  we firmly believe that operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor 
we report results for company operated restaurants based on their sales  less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs 
we report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues  less associated occupancy costs 
for this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure  we do not specifically allocate selling  general administrative expenses and other operating income expenses to company operated or franchised restaurants 
other operating items that relate to the company operated restaurants generally include gains on sales of restaurant businesses and write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements 
we believe the following information about company operated restaurants in our most significant markets will provide an additional perspective on this business 
management responsible for our company operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the company operated business on this basis to assess its performance 
management of the company also considers this information when evaluating our restaurant ownership mix  subject to other relevant considerations 
the tables below seek to illustrate the two components of our company operated margins 
the first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations  which we refer to below as restaurant margin 
the second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and service fees 
we refer to this component as brand real estate margin 
both company operated and franchised restaurants are charged rent and service fees  although rent and service fees for company operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation 
rent and service fees for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales  and the actual percentage attributable to rent varies depending on the level of mcdonald s investment in the restaurant 
service fees may also vary by market 
as shown below  in disaggregating the components of our company operated margins  certain costs with respect to company operated restaurants would be reflected in brand real estate margin 
those costs consist of rent payable by mcdonald s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy other operating expenses recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
restaurant margin would reflect rent and service fees paid  and those fees would be accounted for as income in calculating brand real estate margin 
while we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our company operated business  it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or operating margins as reported by the company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in particular  as noted above  we do not allocate selling  general administrative expenses to our company operated business 
an estimate of costs to support this business was made by the us  canada and our three major markets in europe 
we believe  on average  that a range of  to  per restaurant is typical  but the actual costs will vary by restaurant depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market 
these costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant

impairment and other charges credits  net on a pretax basis  the company recorded impairment and other charges credits  net of million in  million in and million in associated with impairment  as well as certain strategic actions in and a lease accounting correction in mcdonald s management does not include these items when reviewing business performance trends because we do not believe these items are indicative of expected ongoing results

in  the company recorded million of pretax impairment charges primarily in south korea 
in addition  like other companies in the restaurant and retail industries  the company reviewed its accounting practices and policies with respect to leasing transactions 
following this review and in consultation with its external auditors  the company corrected an error in the amount of million pretax in its prior practices to conform the lease term used in calculating straight line rent expense with the term used to amortize improvements on leased property 
the result of the correction primarily accelerated the recognition of rent expense under certain leases that include fixed rent escalations by revising the computation of straight line rent expense to include these escalations for certain option periods 
as the correction related solely to accounting treatment  it did not affect mcdonald s historical or future cash flows or the timing of payments under the related leases

capital expenditures increased million or in and million or in the increase in capital expenditures in both years was primarily due to increased investment in existing restaurants  primarily in the us capital expenditures in both years reflects the company s focus on growing sales at existing restaurants  including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in several markets around the world 
capital expenditures related to discontinued operations were million  million and million in   and  respectively  and primarily related to new chipotle restaurants 
capital expenditures invested in major markets  excluding japan  represented about of the total in  and japan is accounted for under the equity method  and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts 
capital expenditures in millions new restaurants existing restaurants other properties total capital expenditures total assets primarily corporate related equipment and furnishings for office buildings 
new restaurant investments in both and were concentrated in markets with acceptable returns and or opportunities for long term growth 
average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market 
these costs  which include land  buildings and equipment  are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants  construction and design efficiencies and leveraging best practices 
in addition  foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs 
although the company is not responsible for all costs on every restaurant opened  in  total development costs consisting of land  buildings and equipment for new traditional mcdonald s restaurants averaged approximately million in the us and approximately 
table of contents million in the nine markets where development was concentrated outside the us for  the us  china and eight other consolidated markets are expected to open more than restaurants

financial position and capital resources total assets and returns total assets decreased by billion or in changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased total assets by approximately billion in  which was more than offset by a decrease in cash and the disposition of chipotle 
more than of total assets were located in the consolidated major markets at year end net property and equipment increased billion in and represented about of total assets at year end 
total assets at december  included billion of cash borrowed under hia due to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings 
operating income  which excludes interest income  is used to compute return on average assets  while income from continuing operations is used to calculate return on average common equity 
month end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity 
assets of discontinued operations are excluded from the average assets since operating income excludes results from discontinued operations

this effect is excluded  as these adjustments ultimately have no impact on the obligation at maturity 
see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements 
includes the effect of interest rate and foreign currency exchange agreements 

table of contents hia related borrowings caused an percentage point decrease in fixed rate debt in there was a slight increase in fixed rate debt in as the company began to repay a portion of the hia related borrowings 
hia related borrowings caused an percentage point increase in foreign currency denominated debt in moody s  standard poor s and fitch currently rate the company s commercial paper p  a and f  respectively  and its long term debt a  a and a  respectively 
historically  the company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt 
the company s key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table 
while the company targets these metrics for ease of focus  it also looks at similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt 
total adjusted debt is a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above  which includes debt outstanding on the company s balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases 
based on their most recent calculations  these agencies add between billion and billion of debt for lease capitalization purposes 
the company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments 
these adjustments include excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents  excluding certain company operated restaurant lease agreements outside the us that are cancelable with minimal penalties representing approximately of company operated restaurant minimum rents outside the us  based on the company s estimate  capitalizing non restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense  and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent payments due to the company from franchisees operating on leased sites 
based on this calculation  for credit analysis purposes  approximately billion to billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized 
certain of the company s debt obligations contain cross acceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the long term debt of certain subsidiaries 
there are no provisions in the company s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company s business 
the company has billion available under a committed line of credit agreement see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements as well as a us shelf registration of debt securities and a euro medium term notes program that each have approximately billion of company authority remaining for future debt issuances 
the company uses major capital markets  bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense 
the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring  redeeming and repurchasing debt  terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives 
the company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes 
all exchange agreements are over the counter instruments 
in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations  the company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated 
all derivatives were recorded at fair value in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  and primarily in miscellaneous other assets million and million  respectively and other long term liabilities million and million  respectively 
see summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments for additional information regarding their use and the impact of sfas no 
regarding derivatives 
the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties  intercompany financings and long term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates 
in and  the company used foreign currency debt to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated cash and equivalents related to hia 
this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity 
total foreign currency denominated debt  including the effects of foreign currency exchange agreements  was billion and billion for the years ended and  respectively 
in addition  where practical  the company s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges 
the company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements 
certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below  or aggregate exposures exceed  certain contractual limits 
at december  and  the company was required to post collateral of million and million  respectively 
the company s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies 
the company s largest net asset exposures defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities at year end were as follows foreign currency net asset exposures in millions of us dollars euro canadian dollars australian dollars british pounds sterling brazilian reais the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company s results of operations  cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments 
the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments  however  the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels  local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the us based on the results of these analyses of the company s financial instruments  neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from levels nor a adverse change in foreign currency rates from levels would materially affect the company s results of operations  cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the company has long term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations related to both company operated and franchised restaurants and debt obligations 
in addition  the company has long term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements 
cash provided by operations including cash provided by these franchise arrangements along with the company s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december  see discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
contractual cash outflows contractual cash inflows in millions operating leases debt obligations minimum rent under franchise arrangements thereafter total the maturities reflect reclassifications of short term obligations to long term obligations of billion  as they are supported by a long term line of credit agreement expiring in debt obligations do not include million of sfas no 
noncash fair value adjustments 
this effect is excluded because these adjustments ultimately have no impact on the obligation at maturity 
the company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to i make tax deferred contributions and ii receive company provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of internal revenue service limitations 
the investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market rate investment alternatives under the company s qualified profit sharing and savings plan 
total liabilities for the supplemental plans were million at december  and million at december  and were included in other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition to long term obligations  the company had guaranteed certain affiliate and other loans totaling million at december  other matters critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions 
the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity property and equipment property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on management s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property 
the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets  taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors  economic factors and industry trends 
if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment  or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense or write offs in future periods 
share based compensation the company has share based compensation plans which authorize the granting of various equity based incentives including stock options and rsus to employees and non employee directors 
the expense for these equity based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and amortized over their vesting period 
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form pricing model 
the pricing model requires assumptions such as the expected life of the stock option and expected volatility of the company s stock over the expected life  which significantly impact the assumed fair value 
the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants  share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 
the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 
long lived assets impairment review long lived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company s experience and knowledge of its operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  inflation  competition  and consumer and demographic trends 
the biggest assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales 
if the company s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges 

table of contents litigation accruals from time to time  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to competitors  customers  employees  franchisees  government agencies  intellectual property  shareholders and suppliers 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accrual required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter 
the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits  and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
during  the company recorded a million benefit due to favorable audit settlement of the company s us tax returns 
the company s us tax returns are under audit and are expected to be settled in deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for basis differences totaling billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures 
the basis differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the us if management s intentions change in the future  deferred taxes may need to be provided 
effects of changing prices inflation the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively 
this is because of rapid inventory turnover  the ability to adjust menu prices  cost controls and substantial property holdings  many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation 
reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units  the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital 
this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation 
the numerator is the company s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization  from the base period 
the denominator is the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or three year period 
adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities adjusted for cash generated from used for investing activities related to chipotle 
the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis 
these weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter s investing activities to incremental operating income 
for example  fourth quarter cash used for investing activities is weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income of fourth quarter cash used for investing activities is included in the one year and three year calculations 
in contrast  fourth quarter cash used for investing activities is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than months ago  and therefore have a full year impact on operating income  with little or no impact to the base period and of fourth quarter cash used for investing activities is included in the one year and three year calculations  respectively 
management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average
