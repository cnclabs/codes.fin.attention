item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the finish line  inc together with its subsidiaries collectively the company  is one of the largest mall based specialty retailers in the united states  and operates under the finish line  man alive  and paiva brand names 
fiscal was a challenging year 
net sales increased in fiscal  which was on top of an increase in fiscal the majority of this growth was attributable to seven additional days of sales in fiscal million  as new store sales were primarily offset by a decline of in comparable store net sales 
the comparable store net sales were hindered by a highly promotional environment in fiscal along with weakness in several categories including non premium performance footwear  women s footwear and softgoods 
the company believes this weakness was primarily due to a lack of differentiation in the mall  particularly in athletic specialty 
net income for fiscal was million  which was down from million in fiscal several non comparable items that affected net income for fiscal included a million net of tax of million asset impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter for underperforming stores compared to a million net of tax of million asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal also  as a result of adopting statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment and the related change in accounting for share based compensation  net income was million lower due to the incremental share based compensation expense 
in addition  the company estimates that the additional rd week in fiscal benefited net income by approximately million 
fiscal continued to be a year of investment in the company s long term growth and profitability 
with nearly mall based finish line stores in the united states  growing the finish line stores at the same rapid pace as the company has over the past several years will become more challenging due to the limited number of existing or new malls 
therefore  along with continuing to grow finish line new stores opened in fiscal  the company has  and will continue  to invest capital and resources in establishing and growing new avenues for the company 
during fiscal  the company successfully completed the integration of man alive into the company s office and distribution center and onto the company s systems 
also  the company opened new man alive stores during fiscal this represented a increase from the stores that were open at the end of fiscal the company also invested significant capital and resources for the launch of paiva  the company s new concept for active women 
the first store was opened on april  and twelve more stores were opened during fiscal along with additional stores in march during fiscal  the company experienced significant losses related to the startup of paiva 
these losses were primarily due to delayed openings  lower than expected traffic  and over assortment of product 
although the investments in man alive and paiva resulted in diluting earnings during fiscal  the company gained significant knowledge that the company has already begun leveraging and is expected to lead to improved future results and grow the company and shareholder value in the future 
looking ahead to fiscal  the company is working to improve the shopping environment  while creating a differentiated point of view 
the company is working closely with its brand partners in an effort to accomplish these goals from both a product and presentation standpoint 
also  the company has been taking actions to help differentiate the company and improve performance 
some of these actions include focusing more on premium performance products  increasing its sport style offerings  establishing new direct to consumer marketing initiatives  and re merchandising its stores to tell more compelling  relevant stories in both footwear and apparel management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued while the company expects business to remain challenging in the short term  the company believes it is taking the actions necessary to achieve long term growth and profitability 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates these estimates  including those related to the valuation of inventory  the potential impairment of long lived assets and income taxes 
the company bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
costs of sales 
costs of sales include the cost associated with acquiring merchandise from vendors  occupancy costs  provision for inventory shortages  and credits and allowances from our merchandise vendors following emerging issues task force eitf accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf guidance 
because the company does not include the costs associated with operating its distribution facility and freight within cost of sales  the company s gross profit may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in costs of sales and in the calculation of gross profit 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include store payroll and related payroll benefits  store operating expenses  advertising  cooperative advertising allowances following eitf guidance  costs associated with operating our distribution facility and freight  including moving merchandise from our distribution center to stores  share based compensation and other corporate related expenses 
valuation of inventory 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using a weighted average cost method  which approximates the first in  first out method 
the company s valuation of inventory includes markdown adjustments for merchandise that will be sold below cost and the impact of shrinkage 
markdowns are based upon historical information and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
shrinkage is based on historical information and assumptions as to current shrink trends 
it is possible that changes to the markdowns and shrinkage estimates could be required in future periods due to changes in market conditions 
vendor allowances 
the company records vendor allowances and discounts in the consolidated statements of income when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled 
allowances provided by vendors generally relate to profitability of inventory recently sold and  accordingly  are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold as negotiated 
vendors participation in the reduction of the selling price of merchandise fluctuates based on the amount of promotional and clearance markdowns necessary to liquidate the inventory 
vendor allowances received for advertising or fixture programs reduce the company s expense or expenditure for the related advertising or fixture program 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impairment of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which generally requires the company to assess these assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company considers historical performance and future estimated results in its evaluation of potential impairment and then compares the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated non discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by comparing projected individual store discounted cash flows to the asset carrying values 
the estimation of fair value is measured by discounting expected future cash flows at the discount rate the company utilizes to evaluate potential investments 
actual results may differ from these estimates and as a result the estimation of fair values may be adjusted in the future 
the company is required to perform an impairment review of its goodwill if impairment indicators arise and  at a minimum  annually 
the company has chosen to perform this review at the end of january each fiscal year  and it is done in a two step approach 
the initial step requires that the carrying value be compared with its estimated fair value 
the second step  to evaluate goodwill for impairment  is only required if the carrying value of that reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair value is determined based on estimated future discounted cash flows 
the company evaluates its other intangible assets  specifically tradenames  for impairment on an annual basis by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying value 
such estimates are subject to change and the company may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
operating leases 
the company leases retail stores under operating leases 
many lease agreements contain rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
the company recognizes rent expense for minimum lease payments on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
the company uses a time period for its straight line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation 
in addition  the commencement date of the lease term is the earlier of the date when the company becomes legally obligated for the rent payments or the date when the company takes possession of the leased space for buildout 
contingent rents are determined as a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels 
the company records a contingent rent liability in other liabilities and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets and the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when management determines that achieving the specified levels during the fiscal year is probable 
share based compensation expense 
effective february   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment fas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  share based compensation expense recognized during fiscal for share based awards includes a compensation expense for all share based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  february   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation fas  and b compensation expense for all share based compensation awards granted subsequent to february   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  results for the prior period have not been restated 
prior to the adoption of fas r  the company recognized share based compensation expense in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  as permitted by fas the calculation of share based employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management s judgments 
these estimates include the fair value of each of the stock option awards granted  which is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
there are two significant management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued inputs into the black scholes option pricing model expected volatility and expected term 
the company estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company s stock over a term equal to the expected term of the option granted 
the expected term of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under the company s stock option plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and the company uses different assumptions  share based compensation expense could be different in the future 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the company s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate  the share based compensation expense could be different from what the company has recorded in the current year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on share based compensation 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets are recognized for taxable temporary differences  tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
these assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in addition  management is required to estimate taxable income for future years by taxing jurisdictions and to consider this when making its judgment to determine whether or not to record a valuation allowance for part or all of a deferred tax asset 
a one percent change in the company s overall statutory tax rate for would not have a material effect in the carrying value of the net deferred tax asset 
the company has operations in multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve 
accruals of tax contingencies require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of tax audits 
actual results could vary from these estimates

of this increase  million was attributable to an increase from the existing stores open only part of fiscal  and million was attributable to an increase in the total number of stores open during the year from stores at the end of fiscal to stores at the end of fiscal fiscal also had an additional days of sales  which resulted in additional net sales of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in comparable store net sales of for fiscal as compared to the increase reported for fiscal comparable footwear net sales decreased for fiscal the decline is primarily related to the poor performance of women s and non premium performance footwear 
comparable softgoods net sales decreased by for fiscal the decline was primarily related to the continued weakness in licensed jerseys as well as slowdown in accessories 
gross profit  which includes product margin  net of shrink  less store occupancy costs  for fiscal was million compared to gross profit of million in fiscal this represents a decrease of approximately million or over fiscal  and a decrease of as a percentage of net sales 
the decrease was a result of a increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales  a decrease in product margin as a percentage of net sales  and a increase in shrink as a percentage of net sales 
the increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales was primarily a result of deleveraging due to the decline in comparable store net sales for fiscal the decrease in margin for product sold as a percentage of net sales was primarily related to a more promotional environment in fiscal compared to fiscal management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued selling  general and administrative expenses including impairment charge were million in fiscal  an increase of million or over the million in fiscal  and increased to from as a percentage of net sales 
the dollar increase was primarily attributable to the operating costs related to the additional stores opened during the increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily related to the following factors an increase of as a percentage of net sales in payroll related expenses due primarily to deleveraging from negative comparable net sales  an increase of as a percentage of net sales in share based compensation primarily due to the adoption of fas r  an increase of as a percentage of net sales as a result of incremental man alive and paiva costs  and an additional as a percentage of net sales due to the impairment charge taken in fiscal compared to fiscal net interest income for fiscal was million of net sales compared to net interest income of million of net sales for fiscal  a decrease of million

the decrease was a result of a increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales  offset partially by a increase in product margin  and a decrease in shrink 
the increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales was primarily a result of the new stores opened since february  having higher average occupancy costs on a per square foot basis than the remaining store base 
additionally  new store sales typically take years to reach their sales peak 
therefore  the sales performance per square foot for these new stores is less than the remaining store base 
the increase in occupancy costs also resulted from a million increase in step rent expense as the company concluded during fiscal that rent payments required by certain fixed rental lease agreements were not being recognized over the proper lease term 
the increase management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in product margin is due to the sell through of higher priced premium footwear during fiscal as well as the benefit of man alive  which typically has higher product margins than finish line
