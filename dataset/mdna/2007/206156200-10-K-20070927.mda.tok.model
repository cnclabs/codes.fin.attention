the film camera market we manufacture  market and sell single use and mm traditional film cameras to our rsd customers 
o single use cameras single use cameras are inexpensive  easy to use cameras that are sold preloaded with film and batteries and are designed to be used only once by the consumer 
after use  the consumer returns the entire camera to the photo processor 
the processor then extracts the film and either disposes of the used camera or returns and or sells it for recycling uses 
o mm traditional film cameras this category includes reloadable cameras that use mm silver halide film 
film camera market trends market trends for single use and mm traditional film cameras include the following o single use cameras according to available third party market research data  after years of robust growth  the single use camera market reached its peak of million units sold worldwide in calendar year total worldwide sales of single use cameras declined to million units in calendar year  declined to million units in calendar year and are projected to decline to million units in calendar year we believe  however  that single use cameras remain a large and viable category 
we also believe that we are currently the third largest producer of single use cameras in the world 
market research source pma o mm traditional film cameras mm traditional film cameras are being displaced by digital cameras 
in the us market  digital cameras began to outsell film cameras in calendar year the calendar year mm traditional film camera sales in the united states were reported at million units  a decrease from the previous year 
the decline of mm traditional film cameras continued during calendar year at approximately and is projected to decline during calendar year  with sales projected at million units  which represents about a year over year decrease in sales 
in fiscal  total sales of mm traditional film cameras in the us represented approximately of the total image capture product sales in the us and are expected to be approximately in the us during calendar year market research source pmai newsletter in response to the declining market for mm traditional film cameras  in fiscal  we reduced our mm traditional film camera offerings to two models 
during fiscal  we continued to focus our sales effort on these two models  which provide features that satisfies different consumers needs at affordable retail prices below based on the market trends discussed above  we believe that the market for single use cameras remains a viable market for our company 
as a result  we are focusing on increasing our sales of single use cameras through various sales and marketing initiatives and reducing our product costs  while maintaining product performance and quality 
film camera products our film camera products include single use and mm traditional film cameras 
we sell private label and brand name products to our rsd customers worldwide either directly or through third party distributors 
we design  develop and manufacture most of our single use cameras and outsource the manufacture of certain of our single use and mm traditional film cameras 
we offer a complete line of single use cameras  including outdoor  flash  zoom and underwater models 
we believe that we are uniquely structured to provide encasements  finishes  packaging and film speed and lengths to accommodate different user and customer preferences 
our mm traditional film cameras range from entry level to fully featured zoom models and include models used by certain rsd customers to support special promotion and loyalty programs offered to their customers 
our expenditures for product engineering  design and development decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  mainly as a result of our discontinuing digital camera sales 
for additional information regarding product development costs  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing our film camera products are sold to retailers on a worldwide basis through direct sales offices  independent sales representatives and distributors in the united states  canada  latin america the americas  the united kingdom  france and germany europe  and hong kong  china and japan asia 
we currently market our film camera products to retailers on a private label basis and or under the polaroid and polaroid fun shooter brand names 
we have established our presence with our retail customers by offering attractive  easy to use single use and mm traditional film cameras 
we market many different styles of cameras that are sold through many retail outlets 
we have in house sales and marketing personnel who make the majority of our direct sales to our rsd customers 
we also have independent sales representatives who serve specific geographic areas 
sales representatives generally receive commissions ranging from to of net sales to retail customers  depending on the type of customer and product  and may act as sales representatives for manufacturers of other photographic and non photographic products 
we also sell products to distributors on a wholesale basis who  in turn  sell our products to retailers 
competition in the film camera market the film camera market is highly competitive with many companies marketing products to the retail market 
as a producer and or marketer of single use and mm traditional film camera products  we encounter substantial competition from a number of companies  many of which have longer operating histories  more established markets and brand recognition  and more extensive research  development and manufacturing capabilities than we have 
our key competitors in the single use camera market are fuji and kodak  both of whom have greater resources than we have or may reasonably be expected to have in the foreseeable future 
maintaining a competitive advantage depends on our ability to develop and manufacture or purchase high quality products from outsourced manufacturers at the lowest cost 
backlog due to the lead time required for production and shipping and the need to build inventory to meet seasonal demand  we may at times have a backlog of orders for products 
we define backlog as unfulfilled orders supported by signed contracts or purchase orders for delivery of our products generally within the next six months 
our backlog at june  was approximately million 
we experience fluctuations in our backlog at various times during our fiscal year 
we expect that approximately million of the unfulfilled orders at june  will be shipped during the first quarter of fiscal although we believe that our entire backlog consists of firm orders  our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual revenue for any future period because of the possibility of customer cancellations  order changes  changes in delivery schedules and delays inherent in the shipments of products 
no assurance can be given that the current backlog will necessarily lead to revenue in any specific future period 
major customers in fiscal  sales to two of our retail customers represented in excess of of our total net sales i wal mart stores  inc wal mart represented of total net sales  and ii walgreen co 
walgreens represented of total net sales 
see note  geographic area and significant customer information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
seasonality sales of our film camera products are linked to the timing of vacations  holidays and other leisure activities 
sales are normally strongest in the first and second quarters summer  fall and early winter of our fiscal year when demand is high as retailers prepare for the holiday season 
sales are also strong in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year spring to early summer due to demand driven by heavy vacation activity and events such as weddings and graduations 
sales are normally lowest in the third quarter of our fiscal year winter to early spring with the absence of holidays and fewer people taking vacations 
licensing activities we have a worldwide non exclusive license which excluded japan until january  to use certain of the single use camera patents and patent applications of fuji photo film ltd 
fuji in connection with the manufacture  remanufacture and sale of single use cameras 
the license extends until the later of february  or the expiration of the last of the licensed fuji patents and provides for payment of a license fee and certain royalty payments to fuji 
our ability to manufacture and sell single use cameras may depend on the continuation of our right to use the fuji patents 
as a result  we believe the loss of the fuji license prior to the expiration of the patents would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operation 
we have the worldwide  exclusive right to use the polaroid brand name and trademark in connection with the manufacture  distribution  promotion and sale of single use and traditional film based cameras  including zoom cameras and certain related accessories but excluding instant and digital cameras  except for products released by polaroid corporation polaroid into the distribution chain before august  the single use camera license agreement expires on february  and provides for the payment of million of minimum royalties to polaroid  which will be fully credited against percentage royalties 
as of july   we paid million of the minimum royalties 
the traditional film camera license agreement expires on january  and provided for a minimum royalty payment of  to polaroid on or before october   which was fully credited against percentage royalties during the first year of the term ended january  there are no minimum guaranteed royalty payments under the traditional film camera license agreement after the first year of the term 
as of july   our traditional film camera percentage royalties exceeded the minimum royalty amount 
we believe that the loss of the polaroid license could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
as part of our acquisition of jenimage europe gmbh jenimage in  we entered into a twenty year  worldwide trademark license agreement with jenoptik ag for the exclusive use of the jenoptik brand name and trademark on non professional consumer imaging products including  but not limited to  digital  single use and traditional film cameras  and other imaging products and related accessories 
the license provides for the payment of percentage royalties but does not require any minimum guaranteed royalty payments

manufacturing we conduct all of our manufacturing in the prc 
our vertically integrated manufacturing facilities include plastic injection molding of lenses and other parts  stamping and machining of metal parts  manufacturing of printed circuit boards pcbs  assembly of pcbs using surface mount technology machinery and manual insertion  quality control  quality assurance  painting and final assembly and testing 
in fiscal  as a result of our previous restructuring plan  our manufacturing facility focused predominantly on the manufacture of high volume  low cost single use cameras 
our manufacturing and related dormitory facilities in the prc occupy approximately  square feet 
see item  properties  for information on the leases and land use agreements related to our manufacturing facilities in the prc 
our prc manufacturing facilities have been certified under the social accountability standard sa since november the sa is an international standard designed to ensure safe working conditions  fair management practices and the protection of workers rights 
our prc manufacturing facilities are iso and accredited 
in addition  we outsource the manufacture of certain of our film cameras and other products 
equipment  components  raw materials and products from outsourced manufacturers we own the tools and equipment necessary to manufacture a significant number of our single use camera products and components used in our single use camera products 
manufacturers and suppliers located in the far east and other parts of the world supply us with raw materials  components and finished products that we do not manufacture 
we may experience a shortage of supply of  or a delay in  receiving certain components and products as a result of strong demand  capacity constraints  diminishing sources of supply or other problems experienced by our suppliers 
our net sales  gross profits and margins could be adversely affected if we encounter supplier issues and or fail to manage supplier issues properly 
see item a  risk factors 
prc operations our operations are substantially dependent upon our manufacturing and assembly activities in the prc 
our current processing agreement with the prc governmental entities  which allows us to operate in the prc  was renewed in october for an additional ten year term until october see item  properties  for information on the leases and land use agreements related to our manufacturing facilities in the prc 
in  we established  registered and commenced operations of a wholly owned foreign enterprise  concord camera shenzhen company limited concord shenzhen  which is a wholly owned subsidiary of concord camera hk limited cchk  pursuant to the laws of the prc relating to enterprises with a sole foreign investor 
the business license of concord shenzhen permits it to design  develop  manufacture and sell single use  mm traditional film and digital cameras and camera components in the prc and worldwide 
trademarks and patents our trademarks include  among others  concord  concord eye q  go wireless  fun shooter  easyshot  le clic  keystone  apex and goldline for cameras sold in the united states and or numerous foreign countries 
we license the polaroid trademark for exclusive use worldwide in connection with the manufacture  distribution  promotion and sale of single use and traditional film cameras excluding instant and digital cameras 
we also license the jenoptik trademark for exclusive use worldwide for non professional consumer imaging products and accessories both digital and film based 
we own numerous patents  some of which are used in our current products 
we have applied for  and will continue to apply for  in the united states and foreign countries  patents to protect the inventions and technologies developed by or for us 
we do not believe our competitiveness and market share are dependent on the ultimate disposition of our patent applications 
we license patents and patent applications related to single use cameras from fuji in connection with the manufacture and sale of single use cameras 
see licensing activities above 
new business initiatives during fiscal  we initiated a process to identify  assess  quantify and define new products and services potentially capable of increasing our sales and building a profitable business on a sustainable basis 
with this objective  we evaluated opportunities that we had identified based on their industry attractiveness  competitive dynamics  channel compatibility and potential for providing a profitable business model 
we conducted quantitative and qualitative research  during which we exposed various target audiences to our unique product concepts and obtained their feedback to inquiries regarding purchase intent  channel preference and price sensitivity 
we believe a market opportunity exists in the area of personal safety for products that provide peace of mind to a broad base of consumers at an affordable price 
in august  we introduced a new product  onguard kids  a personal safety alert system for children aged five years and older that combines a fashionable digital watch with a decibel emergency alarm signal that can easily be activated by children to call for help in an emergency 
we are now marketing and selling the product to new and existing rsd consumers in the americas and europe 
although the product is suitable for teen agers and young adults  we are initially targeting the five to twelve year old market 
based on us census bureau data  there are approximately million children in the united states between the ages of five and thirteen years old 
employee relations as of august   we had employees  of whom  or were located in hong kong   or  were located in europe and  or  were located in the americas 
we currently have one collective bargaining agreement covering one employee in france that has no stated expiration date 
during fiscal  pursuant to our agreements with prc governmental entities  and based upon production demand  approximately  to  people worked in our prc manufacturing facilities 
we believe that our relationship with our employees and workers is satisfactory 
financial information about geographic areas for financial information about geographic areas  see note  geographic area and significant customer information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the risks attendant to our foreign operations are described in item a  risks factors  below 
item a 
risk factors 
you should carefully consider the following risks regarding our company 
these and other risks could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
you should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report 
we depend on third party suppliers  and our net sales  gross profits and margins could be adversely affected if we encounter supplier issues and or fail to manage supplier issues properly 
we currently purchase certain components from our suppliers and outsource the manufacture of certain of our single use and mm traditional film camera and other products for sale to our customers worldwide 
the term components includes film  batteries  packaging and any other items used in the manufacture of our products by our company or outsourced manufacturers 
our manufacturing  sales and distribution operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components and products and our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components and products at reasonable prices in time to meet critical manufacturing  sales and distribution schedules 
given the variety of products that we offer and might offer in the future  the dispersal of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers across the globe  the diminishing number of our suppliers of certain components and the long lead times that are required to manufacture  assemble and deliver certain components and products  adverse circumstances  issues and problems could arise in planning production  procurement and managing inventory levels that could negatively impact our business and increase our financial exposure and risk 
other supplier problems that we could face include component and product shortages  excess supply and risks related to fixed price contracts that would require us to pay more than the open market price  as more fully described below 
o supply shortages 
we may experience a shortage of supply of  or a delay in receiving  certain components and products as a result of strong demand  capacity constraints  diminishing sources of supply or other problems experienced by suppliers 
if shortages or delays occur or persist  the price of these components and products may increase  we may be exposed to quality issues or the components and products may not be available at all 
we may not be able to secure enough components and or products at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build  sell and distribute new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed 
accordingly  our revenue  gross profits and margins could suffer as we could lose time sensitive sales  incur additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers 
if we cannot adequately address supply issues  we may have to re engineer and or seek other sources for some components and products  resulting in additional costs  delays or insufficient supply of products for our customers 
the number of film suppliers has diminished and we currently rely on our two major competitors in the single use camera market to supply the majority of the film used in the manufacture of our single use cameras 
if either of these suppliers reduces or eliminates its supply of film to us and we are unable to secure film from alternative sources at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality  we will not be able to manufacture the quantities of single use cameras necessary to fulfill our customer orders and our financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
o oversupply 
in order to secure products or components for the production of products  at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or might purchase components in advance of forecasted requirements  or we may enter into non cancelable commitments with suppliers 
if we fail to properly anticipate customer demand  an oversupply of products and or components could result in excess or obsolete inventory 
this excess or obsolete inventory may result in lowering the carrying value of these components and or products by recording an inventory charge which could adversely affect our gross profits and margins 
o long term pricing commitments 
as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers  we may be obligated to purchase components and or products at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions 
in the event that we become committed to purchase components and or products in advance of forecasted requirements and or for prices in excess of the current market price  we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components and or products at the times required and or at lower prices 
this excess in component purchases and in purchase price over current market price may result in lowering the carrying value of those components and or products by recording an inventory charge that could adversely affect our gross profits and margins 
in many instances  we rely on offshore suppliers  including  but not limited to  manufacturers in the prc  for the production of cameras and other products and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 
regional economic  business  environmental  political  medical or military conditions or events could disrupt supplies in foreign locations 
we are dependent on third party service providers to provide distribution facilities for all of our operations in the united states  latin america and europe 
the warehousing and distribution services for our i united states and latin american operations are handled from two distribution facilities operated by third party service providers in san pedro  california and memphis  tennessee  and ii european operations are currently handled from a distribution facility operated by a third party service provider in the netherlands and are being transitioned to a third party distribution facility in the united kingdom 
our products are prepared for shipment and shipped to our customers by such third party service providers at these distribution facilities 
any failure by these third party service providers to maintain a regular flow of products from us to our customers or any significant interruption in the business of these service providers or the operation of these distribution facilities due to natural disasters  accidents  system failures  work stoppages or other causes would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  if the cost of these services increases  our gross profits and margins could suffer 
we face significant risks related to the single use and mm traditional film camera markets 
based upon available third party market research data  the single use camera market is in decline and the mm traditional film camera market is in significant decline and is expected to continue to decline further 
see item  business  film camera market trends  above 
as discussed in this report  we are concentrating on increasing sales of our single use camera products 
there is no assurance  however  that our single use camera sales will increase  or that  even if they do increase  that we will be profitable or that we will be able to maintain our market share in the single use and mm traditional film camera markets 
the camera and photographic products industry is highly competitive 
as a manufacturer  marketer and distributor of single use and mm traditional film cameras  we encounter intense competition from a number of companies  including  without limitation  fuji  kodak and other single use camera manufacturers  each of which has or may have longer operating histories  more established markets  better brand recognition  more extensive facilities and  in some cases  greater resources than we have 
maintaining a competitive advantage against our competitors depends on our ability to develop and manufacture or purchase from outsourced manufacturers high quality cameras at the lowest cost and our ability to market and sell cameras profitably 
these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes  price reductions  and or increased operating costs  such as for marketing and sales incentives  resulting in lower revenues  gross margins and income 
we are dependent on a small number of customers 
we have a small number of customers that represent a high percentage of our revenues 
our products are sold in very competitive markets 
our competitors may adopt more aggressive policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products  which could result in a loss of sales or of customers 
the loss of sales or of one or more of these important customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the loss of wal mart or walgreens as customers would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to credit risk associated with sales to our customers 
we sell a significant number of products to a small number of customers 
receivables arising from these sales are generally not collateralized 
we monitor the creditworthiness of our customers and review outstanding receivable balances for collectibility on a regular basis and record provisions for doubtful accounts  sales allowances and sales returns  as necessary 
if we are unable to collect or timely collect outstanding receivables from our customers or our customers seek protection from their creditors under the federal bankruptcy code or applicable foreign bankruptcy regulations  our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
our new business initiatives may not succeed 
during the normal course of our business  we evaluate  develop and implement various short term and long term business strategies such as our new business initiatives  discussed in part ii  item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these strategies required  and may continue to require  significant financial and human resources 
there can be no assurance that any such strategies  if implemented  will be successful 
the failure of such strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to identify and integrate future acquisitions 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions that we consider reasonable in light of the revenues and the results of operations we believe we will be able to achieve from these acquisitions  once combined and integrated with us 
we compete for acquisitions with other industry competitors  some of which have greater financial and other resources than us 
increased demand for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition prices 
although we believe opportunities may exist for us to grow through acquisitions  we may not be able to identify and consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms 
if we do acquire another company or companies  we may not be able to profitably manage and successfully integrate the acquired company or companies with our operations  sales and marketing efforts without substantial costs or delays 
acquisitions involve a number of potential risks  including the potential loss of customers and contracts  increased leverage and debt service requirements  combining disparate company cultures and facilities and operating in geographically diverse markets 
an inability to identify and or integrate future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our internal control over financial reporting may be insufficient to detect in a timely manner misstatements that could occur in our financial statements in amounts that may be material 
we have previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
we believe that all ten material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we identified as of july  were remediated as of june  we may  however  continue to experience significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future  which  if not remediated  may render us unable to detect in a timely manner misstatements that could occur in our financial statements in amounts that may be material and which may require significant financial and human resources to address and remediate 
for a discussion of our remediation efforts  see item a  controls and procedures  below and the periodic reports that we previously filed with the sec 
we may not continue to meet nasdaq listing standards regarding minimum per share prices 
under nasdaq continued listing standard one rule a  companies listed on the nasdaq global market are required to have  among other criteria  a minimum per share price of at least 
a company may be de listed from the nasdaq global market if its common stock trades below per share for consecutive business days and  after receiving a deficiency notice from nasdaq  does not maintain a minimum bid price of at least for consecutive trading days within a period of days from the date of such notice 
if our common stock is de listed from nasdaq  we will face a significant reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a material reduction in the per share price of our common stock 
in addition  any such de listing could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us  or at all  and may result in the loss of confidence in our financial stability by suppliers  customers and employees 
if our securities are de listed from the nasdaq global market  we may face a lengthy process to re list our securities  if we are able to re list them at all  and the liquidity that nasdaq provides will no longer be available to investors 
we cannot give investors in our common stock any assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the per share minimum price requirement for continued listing on nasdaq or that our stock will not be de listed by nasdaq 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate and or continue to decline 
the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities of many companies and that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results of such companies 
these broad market movements may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in many instances  securities class action litigation has been instituted following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
such litigation was instituted against us  is currently being defended and could continue to result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
see item  legal proceedings  below and note  litigation and settlements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
if we continue to incur substantial losses  we may not have sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs 
although we believe that we have sufficient working capital to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months  our ability to fund our operating requirements and maintain an adequate level of working capital and liquidity may be impaired if we continue to incur losses  fail to generate substantial growth in sales of our products or fail to control operating expenses 
if we require funding to meet our cash flow needs  we may seek to obtain such funding through  among other things  loans or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or by issuing debt that is convertible into equity  existing shareholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage 
moreover  additional funding or capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
we may experience liquidity issues if our reliance on financing facilities increases 
our primary source of liquidity has been provided by our short term investments  funds provided by the collection of accounts receivable and borrowing availability under our financing facilities 
our borrowing capacity under the import facility provided by the hongkong and shanghai banking corporation limited hsbc was reduced during calendar year from million in january to million in september in january  the hsbc financing facilities were further reduced to an aggregate of approximately million and we were required to provide cash deposits pledged as security in the amount of approximately million against the facility  which we subsequently reduced during fiscal by million to million and obtained million of alternative financing from two other hong kong based financial institutions 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  hong kong financing facilities  under the caption  liquidity and capital resources  for additional information on our financing facilities 
due to our recent losses  we may need to increase our reliance on financing facilities  whether through hsbc or other financial institutions and  as a result  we may face liquidity issues due to potential funding limits and debt service requirements imposed by lenders 
additionally  we may not be able to secure such financing on reasonable terms or at all 
a significant increase in our indebtedness could increase our financing costs  interfere with our ability to operate our business effectively and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our future income tax rates could increase and our tax positions may be challenged 
a number of factors will affect our income tax rate in the future  and the combined effect of these factors could result in an increase in our effective income tax rate as compared to our effective income tax rate in fiscal this potential increase in future effective income tax rates would adversely affect net income in future periods 
we operate in different countries that have different income tax rates 
based upon our apportionment of income  our effective income tax rate could fluctuate 
changes in income tax laws in the united states or countries where we presently have operations may further limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses 
any further limitation on our ability to utilize our net operating losses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reviewed certain tax positions of our german subsidiary in conjunction with a german tax audit 
if all of these tax positions are not sustained following the audit  we preliminarily estimate that the potential taxes due to the german taxing authority could be up to million in the aggregate 
the actual tax amounts due  if any  are dependent upon the outcome of the audit and any negotiations or appeals related thereto 
if these or other tax positions that we take are challenged and not sustained  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our cost reduction initiatives may not be successful 
as a result of our continued evaluation of our cost structure and the on going strategic review process  we reduced certain costs including  among other things  employee costs as a result of our eliminating certain employee positions and reducing the size of our operations in the americas  europe and asia 
the expected benefits from these initiatives are subject to many estimates and assumptions  including  but not limited to  assumptions regarding i the amount and timing of cost reductions we can achieve  ii our ability to develop and maintain relationships with outsourced manufacturers for the design  co development and purchase of our products  iii our ability to meet customer demands and fulfill customer service obligations  and iv the costs and timing of activities undertaken in connection with these initiatives 
these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic  competitive and other uncertainties that are difficult to predict and beyond our control 
if these assumptions are not realized  or if other unforeseen events occur  the initiatives may not be successful and our financial condition  results of operations and ability to compete could be adversely affected 
see note  other charges  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the termination of our processing agreement with the prc would disrupt our operations 
our operations are substantially dependent upon our ability to manufacture and assemble our products in the prc 
our current processing agreement with the prc governmental entities  which allows us to operate in the prc  expires in october if  however  the agreement is terminated prior to its expiration and we cannot enter into an arrangement that will permit us to continue to operate in the prc under similar terms and conditions  our financial condition  results of operations and ability to carry on our business could be materially adversely affected 
most of our operations in the prc are subject to regulation by local governmental agencies 
the continuing viability of our prc agreements is critical to our business operations 
we manufacture a large number of the components used in our cameras and assemble all of our own manufactured finished products at our facility in the prc 
during fiscal  based upon production demand  we had approximately  to  workers at our manufacturing facility in the prc either employed by our prc subsidiary or provided through our agreements with various prc government or quasi government entities 
we are responsible for their wages  food and housing and must comply with a variety of local labor and employee benefit laws covering these workers 
while we believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws as currently enforced  these laws are subject to modification and interpretation by local governmental authorities 
we cannot predict the effect of any future modifications to or strict enforcement of the existing laws 
in addition  the termination or material modification of any of our agreements with the prc governmental or quasi government entities could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to political  economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 
we have significant operations outside the united states 
we currently have operations in the americas  europe and asia 
further  we obtain raw materials  components and finished camera products from foreign suppliers  particularly in asia  and import into the prc those materials  components and products obtained from suppliers outside of the prc which may require certain approvals by the prc  including but not limited to certificates  permits and licenses 
accordingly  our business is subject to the political  economic  regulatory and other risks that are inherent in operating in foreign countries 
these risks include  but are not limited to o the difficulty of ensuring that foreign suppliers and workers are complying with applicable laws  rules and regulation regarding manufacturing  safety and environmental standards  o the difficulty of enforcing agreements  collecting receivables and protecting assets through foreign legal systems  o trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  o the imposition of tariffs  exchange controls or other restrictions  o difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations  o inability to obtain approvals or authorizations necessary to import materials  components and or products into our manufacturing facility or increased costs relating thereto  o required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  o changes in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate  particularly in emerging markets  and o increased costs and risks of doing business in a number of foreign jurisdictions 
our business depends in part on our ability to successfully anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks 
we cannot assure you that such risks will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
relocation time and expenses could result in substantial losses 
if we determine it is necessary to relocate our manufacturing facilities from the prc  or to another location within or outside of the prc  due to confiscation  expropriation  nationalization  embargoes  governmental restrictions or for other regulatory  business and or financial reasons  we would incur substantial operating and capital losses  including losses resulting from business interruption and delays in production 
in addition  as a result of a relocation of our manufacturing equipment and other assets  we may incur relatively higher manufacturing costs  which could reduce sales and decrease the gross profits and margins on the products we manufacture 
relocation of our manufacturing operations could also result in disruption in the delivery of our products  which could  in turn  reduce demand for our products in the future 
we are exposed to risks associated with intellectual property used in our products 
our products use technology which may be protected by united states or foreign patents 
the right to use such intellectual property is subject to the availability of licenses from the owners of the intellectual property 
if licenses are not available  or are only available on onerous terms  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
third parties also may claim that we  or the customers we indemnify  are infringing upon their intellectual property rights 
even if we believe that the claims are without merit  the claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and divert management s attention and resources away from our business 
claims of intellectual property infringement also may require us to redesign affected products  enter into costly settlement or license agreements  pay costly damage awards or cease marketing of certain products subject to the claims 
even if we have an agreement with a third party to indemnify us against such costs  the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations to us 
if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all or on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source  our operations could suffer 
those claims for which legal proceedings have been initiated against us are discussed in item  legal proceedings  and in note  litigation and settlements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have also received notifications from two entities  one of which was a significant customer  alleging that certain of our digital cameras infringe upon those entities respective patents 
we have engaged in discussions with these entities regarding resolution of the claims 
based on our initial assessment of these two claims  infringement of one or more patents is probable if the patents are valid 
based upon the licensing discussions to date  we preliminarily estimate the potential royalties due to these two claimants for digital camera sales through june  to be between and approximately million in the aggregate 
the actual royalty amounts  if any  for past and future sales are dependent upon the outcome of the negotiations 
we have notified certain of our suppliers of our right to be indemnified by the suppliers in the event we are required to pay royalties or damages to either claimant 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount of the potential loss  if any  within the range of estimates relating to these claims 
accordingly  no amounts have been accrued related to these claims as of june  if these and other claims are determined to be valid  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our ability to manufacture and sell single use cameras is substantially dependent on our licensing agreement with fuji 
our business is substantially dependent on our license from fuji  which granted us a worldwide non exclusive right to use certain fuji patents and patent applications related to single use cameras 
the license extends until the later of the expiration of the last of the licensed fuji patents or february  after the term of the license expires  we expect to continue to be able to manufacture and sell single use cameras without a license 
if  however  the license is terminated prior to the expiration of the patents  we may not be able to continue to manufacture and sell single use cameras and  as a result  our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the loss of our licensing agreement with polaroid could impact our sales 
we currently market and sell our branded single use and mm traditional film camera products under the polaroid brand name pursuant to license agreements with polaroid which expire on february  and january   respectively 
if either license agreement is terminated prior to its expiration or if we are unable to renew the license agreements upon their expiration  our sales volumes and or prices will decrease  resulting in lower revenues  gross margins and income and our financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
we are exposed to interest rate and exchange rate risk 
as a result of our global operating and financing activities  we are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rates and interest rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
exchange rates and interest rates in certain markets in which we do business tend to be more volatile than those in the united states and western europe 
if there is a significant devaluation of the currency in a specific country  the prices of our products will increase relative to that country s currency and our products may be less competitive in that country 
we generally do not engage in currency hedging activities 
the prc government announced on july  that its currency will no longer be pegged to the us dollar 
instead  the exchange rates for the chinese yuan  or renminbi  will be determined by a basket of foreign currencies and continues to fluctuate 
currently  we generate nominal net sales valued in renminbi 
net sales recorded in hong kong are denominated in hong kong dollars  the exchange rate of which has not been affected by the yuan revaluation and is still pegged to the us dollar 
significant fluctuations in the exchange rates on the currency revaluation could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the interest rate related to our hong kong financing facilities provided by hsbc and other hong kong based financial institutions is based on a spread over the hong kong interbank offered rate on import loans denominated in hong kong dollars and over the us prime rate  london interbank offered rate or the singapore interbank offered rate on import loans denominated in other currencies 
a significant change in these rates could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
currently  we are not utilizing any interest rate protection agreements to limit our exposure to this risk 
we are dependent on a small group of key personnel 
our business is managed by a small number of key management and operating personnel 
the loss of key management and operating personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business 
we believe our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract highly skilled and qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
we may not be able to hire the necessary personnel to implement our business strategies  or we may need to pay higher compensation for employees than currently budgeted and or anticipated in the future 
our inability to attract and retain such personnel could limit our growth and affect our financial condition and results of operations 
international trade restrictions could adversely affect our business and growth 
the united states  the prc  hong kong  the european union or other countries where we do business may impose trade restrictions that could adversely affect our operations 
in addition  the united states is currently monitoring various prc practices  including trade  investment and government procurement  as well as the prc s compliance with various multilateral and bilateral agreements 
we cannot predict whether the united states will take future trade actions against the prc that may result in increased tariffs against prc products  including products that we import into the united states 
our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters  business interruptions or similar events 
disasters such as hurricanes  typhoons  earthquakes  or other acts of nature  terrorist attacks  fire  water or electricity failure  or accidents affecting our operating activities  facilities  and employees and customers health could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in particular  our operations in the prc  as well as most of our outsourced manufacturers  suppliers and service providers involved in the manufacturing of components and products are located within a relatively close proximity of one another in the prc 
therefore  any disaster that strikes within close proximity of that geographic area could disrupt our business and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in the event of another outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  or some other disease or health related issue  our facilities and or the facilities of our outsourced manufacturers  suppliers and service providers located in hong kong  the prc and other parts of the world could be quarantined  temporarily closed and or disrupted 
if such an outbreak occurs  it could delay or prevent us from developing new products or manufacturing  testing or shipping our current or future products  and may require us to find other providers of such services and or products  which may be unavailable or more expensive 
further  if a sars or other disease outbreak or other health related issue has an adverse impact on the businesses of our customers  it could reduce the size and or frequency of our customers purchases  which could adversely impact our results of operations
