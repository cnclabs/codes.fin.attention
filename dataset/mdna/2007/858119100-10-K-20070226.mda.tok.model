operations we are one of the largest steel producers in the united states based on an estimated annual steelmaking capability of million tons  with shipments from steel operations totaling million tons 
our consolidated shipments  which exclude shipments between our operating divisions  totaled million tons 
our operations previously consisted of two reporting segments steel operations and steel scrap substitute operations  however  with the addition of three joist fabrication facilities acquired pursuant to the roanoke electric steel corporation roanoke electric merger in april  we added a third reporting segment steel fabrication 
upon the addition of two steel scrap processing locations also in connection with the roanoke electric merger  we changed the steel scrap substitute operations segment to steel scrap and scrap substitute operations 
steel operations 
steel operations include our flat roll division  structural and rail division  engineered bar products division  roanoke bar division and swva operations 
these operations consist of mini mills  producing steel from steel scrap  using electric arc furnaces  continuous casting and automated rolling mills 
steel operations accounted for  and of our consolidated net sales during  and  respectively 
the flat roll division accounted for  and of our consolidated net sales during  and  respectively 
this decreased concentration in flat rolled steel reflects our growth and escalating product diversification through the continued increase of sales from the structural and rail and the engineered bar products divisions  as well as through the addition of the roanoke bar division and swva operations pursuant to the roanoke electric merger 
the flat roll division sells a broad range of hot rolled  cold rolled and coated steel products  including a large variety of specialty products such as light gauge hot rolled  galvanized  and painted products 
the structural and rail division sells structural steel beams and pilings and is also designed to produce and sell a variety of standard and premium grade rail for the railroad industry 
the engineered bar products division primarily sells special bar quality and merchant bar quality rounds and round cornered squares 
the roanoke bar division sells billets and merchant steel products  including angles  plain rounds  flats and channels 
swva primarily sells merchant beams  channels and specialty structural steel sections 
our steel operations sell directly to end users and service centers 
these products are used in numerous industry sectors  including the automotive  construction  commercial  transportation and industrial machinery markets 
fabrication operations 
fabrication operations include our five new millennium building systems plants located in butler  indiana  lake city  florida  salem  virginia  florence  south carolina  and continental  ohio 
the operations located in salem  florence and continental were acquired in pursuant to the roanoke electric merger 
revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses  girders  steel joists and steel decking used within the non residential construction industry 
fabrication operations accounted for  and of our consolidated net sales during  and  respectively 
steel scrap and scrap substitute operations 
steel scrap and scrap substitute operations include the revenues and expenses associated with our two steel scrap processing locations acquired through the roanoke electric merger and from our scrap substitute manufacturing facility  iron dynamics idi 
output from these operations is generally used as raw materials within our steel operations 
roanoke electric merger we completed our merger with roanoke electric on april   immediately following approval of the transaction by roanoke electric stockholders 
through the merger we have further diversified our product mix  expanded our presence in the bar joist market and gained additional expertise and presence in the scrap processing business 
roanoke electric has steel manufacturing facilities in roanoke  virginia and huntington  west virginia 
these facilities produce angles  rounds  flats  channels  beams  special sections and billets  which are sold to steel service centers  fabricators  original equipment manufacturers and other steel producers 
roanoke also has certain subsidiaries involved in steel fabrication including bar joist and truck trailer beams  and has two steel scrap processing locations 
pursuant to the merger agreement  roanoke electric stockholders received in cash and shares of our common stock for each share of roanoke electric stock outstanding at the effective date of the merger 
based on  shares of roanoke electric stock outstanding prior to the close of the transaction  we paid million in cash  issued million shares of registered steel dynamics common stock valued at million from our treasury stock reserves  incurred million in transaction costs  and assumed million in debt  which we retired on april  the cash portion of the purchase price was funded from cash on hand 
roanoke electric operating results are reflected in our financial statements from the effective date of the merger  april   through december  income statement classifications net sales 
net sales from steel operations are a factor of net tons shipped  product mix and related pricing 
net sales from steel fabrication are recognized from construction contracts utilizing a percentage of completion method  which is based on the percentage of steel consumed to date as compared to the estimated total steel required for each contract 
steel fabrication revenues accounted for approximately and of our total net sales during and  respectively 
our net sales are determined by subtracting product returns  sales discounts  return allowances and claims from total sales 
we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel  product dimensions  or certain smaller volumes  and for value added processing or coating of steel products 
we also charge marginally higher prices for our value added products 
these products include hot rolled and cold rolled galvanized products  cold rolled products  and painted products from our flat roll division  certain special bar quality products from our engineered bar products division  and certain industrial truck and trailer products from our steel of west virginia operations 
costs of goods sold 
our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products 
the principal elements of these costs are steel scrap and scrap substitutes  alloys  zinc  natural gas  argon  direct and indirect labor and related benefits  electricity  oxygen  electrodes  depreciation  materials and freight 
our metallic raw materials  steel scrap and scrap substitutes  represent the most significant component of our costs of goods sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales  finance and accounting  and administrative departments 
these costs include labor and benefits  professional services  financing cost amortization  property taxes  and profit sharing expense 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt described in the notes to our financial statements net of capitalized interest costs that are related to construction expenditures during the construction period of material capital projects 
other income expense 
other income consists of interest income earned on our cash balances and any other non operating income activity  including gains on certain short term investments 
other expense consists of any non operating costs 
operating results vs 
net income was million or per diluted share during  compared with million or per diluted share during our gross margin percentage was and during and  respectively 
our average consolidated selling price per ton shipped increased  or  when compared to  while at the same time costs associated with our metallic raw materials on a comparative basis increased only per net ton consumed 
these circumstances resulted in increased gross margin 
gross profit 
during  our net sales increased billion  or  to billion  while our consolidated shipments increased million tons  or  to million tons  when compared with the increase in shipments was due to increased shipments at each of our three steelmaking operations and the inclusion of shipments from our roanoke electric operations from the effective date of the merger april  through the end of the year 
our flat roll division increased shipments by  tons  or 
our structural and rail division increased shipments by  tons  or  which resulted from increased demand for structural products for the non residential construction industry 
our engineered bar products division increased shipments by  tons  or  during this period as a result of increased demand for special bar quality products and the continued development of longer term customer supply relationships 
during  the engineered bar products division constructed and commenced operations of an on site finishing facility which has enhanced margins 
the finishing facility began limited operations during the second quarter of and became fully operational during the third quarter 
also included in our shipments are volumes from our newly acquired roanoke electric steelmaking operations of  tons from our roanoke bar division and  tons from our steel of west virginia operations 
our average consolidated selling price per ton shipped increased compared with during the third quarter of  inventories increased at steel service centers and prices softened for certain flat rolled products as a consequence 
during  the volume of steel products imported into the united states increased  driven by strong demand and short term supply constraints for certain products 
we believe import volumes could decline in the short term as a result of increased inventories  however  import activity is difficult to forecast 
we have seen a recovery in our flat rolled order pricing during the first quarter and anticipate further strengthening in the second quarter 
continued strength within the non residential construction market has resulted in sustained strong demand for structural steel and building fabrication products 
we anticipate a decrease in our first quarter average pricing  however  we believe we will see some recovery in the second quarter based on current market conditions 
average consolidated quarterly sales price graphic generally  we incur higher production costs when manufacturing value added products such as cold rolled  galvanized  and painted flat rolled steel  as well as special bar quality steels 
the following charts depict our steel and fabrication operations product mix by major product category for the years ended december  based on tons shipped from these operations 
flat rolled hot band pickled oiled cold rolled cold rolled galvanized hot rolled galvanized painted structural wide flange beams  h piling and specialty bar sbq and merchant shapes fabrication joists  girders and decking metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our most significant manufacturing cost 
our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed increased during as compared to during and  respectively  our metallic raw material costs represented and of our total manufacturing costs 
previous to  our metallic raw material costs represented between and of our total manufacturing costs  however  this percentage increased to as high as in  when the industry encountered historically high steel scrap prices 
we anticipate an increase in steel scrap prices during the first quarter  which  when coupled with our anticipated decrease in average product pricing would result in somewhat decreased margins when compared to the fourth quarter of quarterly change in cost of metallic raw materials consumed graphic selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million during  as compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
our selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of our total net sales during and  respectively 
we recorded expense of million and million during and  respectively  related to our steel dynamics performance based profit sharing plan allocation which is currently calculated as of pretax earnings 
during  we recorded additional profit sharing expense of million  related to certain roanoke electric and other subsidiaries whose employees did not participate in the aforementioned plan until august  our board of directors approved an increase from to the current in the profit sharing rate effective august   in recognition of the additional plan participants added as a result of the roanoke electric merger 
we adopted fas r on january   which requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity based instruments in the financial statements 
during  we recorded million of equity based compensation expense related to our outstanding incentive stock options 
interest expense 
during  gross interest expense decreased million  or  to million and capitalized interest increased  to million  when compared to the interest capitalization that occurred during these periods resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our engineered bar products and structural and rail divisions 
we currently anticipate gross interest expense to remain consistent throughout other income expense 
other income was million during  as compared to million during during  other income was principally composed of certain non operating revenues recognized at several of the roanoke electric subsidiaries 
during other income was principally from the sale of certain equity securities held as short term investments 
income taxes 
during  our income tax provision was million  as compared to million during our effective income tax rate was and during and  respectively 
during the second quarter of  we decreased our estimated annual effective tax rate to reflect  among other things  the recognition of research and development tax credits and the reduction in our expected state tax rate due to the roanoke electric merger 
operating results vs 
net income was million or per diluted share during  compared with million or per diluted share during when compared to  our average consolidated selling price per ton shipped decreased we experienced a compression of in our gross margin percentage not only due to reduced product pricing  but also due to increased costs associated with our manufacturing processes caused by a change in the types of products produced and higher energy costs 
gross profit 
during  our net sales increased slightly to billion while our consolidated shipments increased  tons  or  to million tons  when compared to the increase in shipments was primarily due to increased shipments of  tons from our structural and rail division  as a result of increased demand for structural products for the commercial construction industry  and  tons from our bar products division  as a result of the division s continued efforts to penetrate the special bar quality market 
the special bar quality market is dominated by long term customer supply contracts 
our bar products division started operations in january and since that time has been selling into the spot market and commissioning various products for customer testing and certification to develop customer relationships and pursue long term customer supply contracts 
domestic demand for flat rolled products was weaker than expected during the first half of due to excessive inventories at steel service centers and end users 
inventories declined through the first half and the market for flat rolled products improved early in the second half and stabilized through year end 
scrap prices fluctuated significantly through the year but did not reach the historic highs seen in non residential construction activity improved throughout resulting in stronger demand for structural steel  fabricated steel joists and decking and flat rolled steel products 
during  we experienced an increase in electricity and natural gas costs 
combined electricity and natural gas costs were and of total costs of goods sold during and  respectively  however  these costs increased to of our total costs of goods sold during the second half of as energy costs increased and as some of our lower priced forward purchased gas positions expired 
natural gas consumption is a much less significant component in the production of steel through electric arc furnace operations  such as ours  than in traditional steel manufacturing blast furnace operations 
our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed decreased during as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million during  as compared to million during  a decrease of million  or 
our total selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of net sales  during and  respectively 
included in our selling  general and administrative expenses are costs related to our performance based profit sharing plan  which is based on of pretax earnings  and totaled million and million during and  respectively 
interest expense 
during  gross interest expense decreased million  or  to million  and capitalized interest decreased million to  as compared to this decrease in gross interest expense was the result of interest expense of million that was recorded during in conjunction with a one time short term us treasury bond transaction 
the interest capitalization that occurred during these periods resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our bar products division and structural rail division 
other income expense 
other income was million during  as compared to million during during the third quarter of  we recorded gains of million from the sale of certain equity securities 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a short term us treasury bond transaction to generate net interest income in an increasing interest rate environment and to generate capital gains 
this transaction was completed during the fourth quarter  and we recorded associated gains of million during income taxes 
during  our income tax provision was million  as compared to million during the same period in our effective income tax rate was increased to for the second half of due to increased profitability 
we further increased our effective income tax rate to beginning january   in anticipation of the year s expected profitability levels and the resulting impact to our state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for  among other things  the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steelmaking and finishing operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws 
our short term and long term liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures  working capital requirements and principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness 
we have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations  equity  long term borrowings  state and local grants and capital cost reimbursements 
working capital 
during  our operational working capital position  representing our cash invested in trade receivables and inventories less trade payables and accruals increased million to million compared to december  approximately million of working capital was associated with the roanoke electric merger 
trade receivables increased million  or  during to million  of which more than  were current or less than days past due 
our largest customer is an affiliated company  heidtman steel  which represented and of our outstanding trade receivables at december  and  respectively 
during  our inventories increased million  or  to million 
raw materials and finished goods generally increased during for all of our steelmaking divisions 
our trade payables and general accruals increased million  or  during capital expenditures 
during  we invested million in property  plant and equipment  of which slightly more than was related to the completion of a bar finishing facility at our engineered bar products division  the continued construction of a welding facility at our structural and rail division  and the continued reconfiguration of the three acquired roanoke electric joist plants 
the remaining capital expenditures represented improvement projects at our existing facilities  including the caster expansion at our flat roll division 
we believe these capital investments will increase our net sales and related cash flows as each project develops 
capital resources and long term debt 
during  our total outstanding debt  including unamortized bond premium  decreased million to million 
during  holders of our convertible subordinated notes converted million of the notes to steel dynamics common stock  resulting in the issuance of  shares from our treasury reserves 
there are currently  shares still available for conversion pursuant to these notes 
our long term debt to capitalization ratio  representing our long term debt divided by the sum of our long term debt and our total stockholders equity  was and at december  and  respectively 
at december   there were outstanding borrowings of million under our million senior secured revolving credit facility 
the senior secured credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our and our wholly owned subsidiaries receivables and inventories and by pledges of all shares of capital stock and inter company debt held by us and each of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the senior secured credit agreement contains financial covenants and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures  incur indebtedness  permit liens on property  enter into transactions with affiliates  make restricted payments or investments  enter into mergers  acquisitions or consolidations  conduct asset sales  pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities 
our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial covenants and other covenants contained in the senior secured credit agreement 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december   and expect to remain in compliance during the next twelve months 
common stock purchases 
from time to time  our board of directors authorizes management to repurchase shares of steel dynamics common stock through open market trades 
we repurchased million shares for million during  million shares for million during  and million shares for million during as of december   we had remaining authorization in place from our board of directors to repurchase approximately million additional shares 
the repurchase program does not have an expiration date cash dividends 
we declared cash dividends of million  or 
per share  during  million  or 
per share  during  and million  or 
per share  during we paid cash dividends of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
we anticipate continuing comparable quarterly cash dividends throughout the determination to pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors  after taking into account various factors  including our financial condition  results of operations  outstanding indebtedness  current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans 
in addition  the terms of our senior secured revolving credit agreement and the indenture relating to our senior notes restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay 
stock split 
our board of directors authorized a two for one stock split  in the form of a stock dividend  for shareholders of record at the close of business on november   and also authorized an increase in our authorized common shares from million shares with a par value of 
per common share to million shares with a par value of 
per common share 
all prior period share and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect this stock split 
other 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which  in turn  will depend upon general economic  financial and business conditions  along with competition  legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our operating results  cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future 
we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds  including additional borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement  will be adequate for the next two years for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  funding working capital requirements and funding anticipated capital expenditures 
during  we currently anticipate spending approximately million on capital improvement projects at our existing facilities and on  among others  the following capital projects approximately million in connection with the addition of a second rolling mill at our structural and rail division  million in connection with the reconfiguration of three of our joist plants  million in connection with the addition of a paint line and other coating capabilities at our jeffersonville galvanizing facility  million in connection with certain upgrades at our roanoke bar division  million in connection with various raw material sourcing projects  and million of various smaller individual projects at our existing operations 
these amounts do not include capital requirements that may arise from our involvement in new joint ventures or merger and acquisition activity that may occur throughout the year 
during  we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately million 
based on our current abatements and incentive credits  and utilizing our existing long lived asset structure  we estimate the remaining annual effect on future operations to be approximately million  million  million  million  million  million    and  during the years through  respectively 
contractual obligations and other long term liabilities we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations  including purchase obligations  as defined by the us securities and exchange commission 
a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
other long term liabilities are defined as long term liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles 
based on this definition  the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations 
it does not include normal purchases  which are made in the ordinary course of business 
the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other long term liabilities as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period total after long term debt estimated interest payments on debt and interest rate swap payments purchase obligations construction commitments total the long term debt payment information presented above assumes that our senior unsecured notes and our convertible subordinated notes remain outstanding until maturity 
our million senior unsecured notes are currently redeemable and available for repurchase  and the earliest date at which redemption or repurchase may occur for our million convertible subordinated notes is december  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding our long term debt 
the estimated interest payments shown above assume interest rates of on our million senior unsecured notes due march   on our million convertible subordinated notes due december   on our outstanding senior secured revolver balance and on our other fixed rate debt of approximately million 
purchase obligations include commitments we have for the purchase of natural gas and its transportation to be utilized within our production process 
these arrangements have take or pay or other similar commitment provisions 
we have fully utilized all such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts 
construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december  other matters inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
environmental and other contingencies we have incurred  and in the future will continue to incur  capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control  remediation  monitoring and compliance 
during  we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately  over of the costs incurred during for monitoring and compliance were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in the steelmaking process in accordance with legal requirements 
we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately  at two of our joist plants during there were no known outstanding contingent matters related to environmental remediation  therefore  there were no related accruals recorded at december  we believe  apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and proposed manufacturing facilities  that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  however  environmental laws and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years  and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments in note to our consolidated financial statements  we discuss new accounting policies adopted by steel dynamics during and the expected financial impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers upon shipment 
provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience 
if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends  additional provision may be necessary 
our steel joist and steel decking operation  new millennium building systems  recognizes revenues from construction contracts on a percentage of completion method based on steel consumed to date as a percentage of the estimated total steel required for each contract 
new millennium accounted for of our net sales 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers  which are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors  including the automotive  construction  commercial  transportation and industrial machinery markets 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks  historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers 
we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary  such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowance may be required 
impairments of long lived assets 
in accordance with the methodology described in fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment losses are recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 
deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to interest rate changes 
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 
we generally maintain fixed rate debt as a percentage of our net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage 
a portion of our debt has an interest component that resets on a periodic basis to reflect current market conditions 
the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weighted average interest rates by maturity date for our long term debt as of december  in thousands interest rate risk fixed rate variable rate expected maturity date principal average rate principal average rate thereafter total fair value commodity risk in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of steel products and to the purchase of commodities used in our production process  such as metallic raw materials  electricity  natural gas and alloys 
our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 
during  approximately of our net sales were under fixed price contracts with greater than twelve month commitments 
our risk strategy associated with the purchase of commodities utilized within our production process has generally been to make certain commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for such commodities 
certain commitments contain provisions which require us to take or pay for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to two years for physical commodity requirements and for up to years for commodity transportation requirements 
our commitments for natural gas and its transportation with take or pay or other similar commitment provisions for the years ending december are as follows in thousands thereafter we fully utilized all such take or pay requirements during the past three years and purchased million  million and million  during the years ended december   and  respectively  under these contracts 
we believe that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process 
we also purchase electricity consumed at our flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december the contract designates hours annually as interruptible service and establishes an agreed fixed rate energy charge per mill kwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement
