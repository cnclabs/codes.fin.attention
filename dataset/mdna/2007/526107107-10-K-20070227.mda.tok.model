item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we participate in four reportable business segments of the hvacr industry 
the first reportable segment is residential heating cooling  in which we manufacture and market a full line of heating  air conditioning and hearth products for the residential replacement and new construction markets in the united states and canada 
the second reportable segment is commercial heating cooling  in which we primarily manufacture and sell rooftop products and related equipment for light commercial applications in the united states and canada and primarily rooftop products  chillers and air handlers in europe 
the third reportable segment is service experts  which includes sales  installation  maintenance  and repair services for hvac equipment in the united states and canada 
the fourth reportable segment is refrigeration  in which we manufacture and sell unit coolers  condensing units and other commercial refrigeration products in the united states and international markets 
our products and services are sold through a combination of distributors  independent and company owned dealer service centers  other installing contractors  wholesalers  manufacturers representatives  original equipment manufacturers and national accounts 
the demand for our products and services is seasonal and dependent on the weather 
hotter than normal summers generate strong demand for replacement air conditioning and refrigeration products and services and colder than normal winters have the same effect on heating products and services 
conversely  cooler than normal summers and warmer than normal winters depress hvacr sales and services 
in addition to weather  demand for our products and services is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors  such as interest rates  the availability of financing  regional population and employment trends  new construction  general economic conditions and consumer confidence 

table of contents the principal elements of cost of goods sold in our manufacturing operations are components  raw materials  factory overhead  labor and estimated costs of warranty expense 
in our service experts segment  the principal components of cost of goods sold are equipment  parts and supplies and labor 
the principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel  copper and aluminum 
higher prices for these commodities and related components continue to present a challenge to us and the hvacr industry in general 
we partially mitigated the impact of higher commodity prices in and through a combination of price increases  commodity contracts  improved production efficiency and cost reduction initiatives 
we estimate approximately of the sales of our residential heating cooling segment is for new construction  with the balance attributable to repair  retrofit and replacement 
with the current downturn in residential new construction activity  we are seeing a decline in the demand for the products and services we sell into this market 
our fiscal year ends on december and our interim fiscal quarters are each comprised of weeks 
for convenience  throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the week periods comprising each fiscal quarter are denoted by the last day of the calendar quarter 
results of operations overview of results consolidated net sales increased in as compared to the prior year primarily due to price increases and a higher average price point for residential hvac products that comply with the naeca seer energy efficiency standard 
net sales increased across all of our segments 
operational income from continuing operations was million in as compared to million in as higher commodity costs and increased selling  general and administrative sg a costs more than offset the favorable impact of increased net sales 
net income for increased to million from million in primarily due to lower income taxes in net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million for as compared to million for primarily due to an increase in working capital in we paid million to repurchase shares of common stock and paid cash dividends of million to our stockholders in we recorded an adjustment in the fourth quarter to decrease retained earnings as of january  by million for errors in estimates associated with pre existing product warranty liabilities under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no

adoption of sab no 
during the fourth quarter of  we adopted sab no 
the transition provisions of sab no 
permitted us to adjust for the cumulative effect in retained earnings for immaterial errors relating to prior periods 
in accordance with sab no 
 we reduced retained earnings as of january  by million to reflect understatements in product warranty liabilities caused by misstatements that occurred in prior years 
the resulting adjustments do not affect previously reported cash flows from operations and the impact on prior years financial position and results of operations was immaterial 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the total cumulative impact is as follows in millions retained earnings deferred income taxes product warranty liability accounting for futures contracts in connection with our year end procedures related to the accounting for futures contracts for copper and aluminum  we determined that certain of our futures contracts previously designated as cash flow hedges did not qualify for hedge accounting under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 as our documentation did not meet the criteria specified by sfas no 
in order for the hedging instruments to qualify for cash flow designation 
this determination resulted in two different types of adjustments to our quarterly consolidated financial statements for the year ended december
