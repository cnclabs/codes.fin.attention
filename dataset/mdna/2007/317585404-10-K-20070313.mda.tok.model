net interest income  the principal source of the company s earnings  was million in down from million in and million in net interest margin was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decline in net interest income resulted from lower earning asset levels along with a narrowed net interest margin

critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and are consistent with predominant practices in the financial services industry 
application of critical accounting policies  which are those policies that management believes are the most important to the company s financial position and results  requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
future changes in information 
table of contents may affect these estimates  assumptions and judgments  which  in turn  may affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
the company has numerous accounting policies  of which the most significant are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses are reported in the consolidated financial statements and how those reported amounts are determined 
based on the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has determined that the accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses and goodwill require particularly subjective or complex judgments important to the company s financial position and results of operations  and  as such  are considered to be critical accounting policies as discussed below 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications of loans  changes in the nature of the loan portfolio  industry concentrations and the impact of current local  regional and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
for additional discussion related to the company s accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses  see the sections titled analysis of allowance for loan losses and allocation of allowance for loan losses in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets prescribes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to initial recognition 
the provisions of sfas no 
discontinue the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
instead  these assets are subject to at least an annual impairment review  and more frequently if certain impairment indicators are in evidence 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate impairment may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
during  and  the company evaluated goodwill for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis and determined no impairment existed

in addition  the company regularly evaluates prevailing economic and business conditions  industry concentrations  changes in the size and characteristics of the portfolio and other pertinent factors 
the process used by the company to determine the overall allowance for loan losses is based on this analysis 
based on this analysis the company believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate at december  assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involves substantial uncertainties and is based upon management s evaluation of the amounts required to meet estimated charge offs in the loan portfolio after weighing various factors 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is subject to ongoing management review 
while management evaluates currently available information in establishing the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review a financial institution s allowance for loan losses and carrying amounts of other real estate owned 
such agencies may require the financial institution to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination

 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and the remaining portfolios of commercial  commercial real estate  agricultural and agricultural real estate loans are segmented into the following loan classification categories uncriticized or pass  special mention  and substandard 
the substandard category of loans greater than  is then further divided into two groupings based on an assessment of the individual loan s collateralization levels ie under collateralized or adequately collateralized 
loans under collateralized by less than of the outstanding loan balance are treated the same as adequately collateralized loans 
if applicable  substandard loans where the collateral deficiency is greater than are split into two categories based on outstanding loan balances ie million or more and less than million 
the inherent risk of loss on the loans in each of these groupings is estimated based upon historical net loan charge off considerations  review of the amount of under collateralization of the loans in the respective groupings  as well as other qualitative factors 
uncriticized loans  special mention loans  adequately collateralized substandard loans and all substandard loans under  are assigned allowance allocations based on historical net loan charge off experience for each of the respective loan categories  supplemented with additional reserve amounts  if considered necessary  based upon qualitative factors 
these qualitative factors include the levels and trends in delinquencies  nonaccruing loans  and risk ratings  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policy  experience  ability  and depth of management  national and local economic conditions  and concentrations of credit  among others 

table of contents the consumer loan portfolio is segmented into six types of loans residential real estate  home equity lines of credit  consumer direct  consumer indirect  overdrafts and personal lines of credit 
each of those categories is subdivided into categories based on delinquency status  either days and over past due or under days 
allowance allocations on these types of loans are based on the average loss experience over the last three years for each subdivision of delinquency status supplemented with qualitative factors containing the same elements as described above 
a further component of the allowance is the unallocated portion which takes into consideration the inherent risk of loss in the portfolio not identified in the other three categories and includes such elements as risks associated with variances in the rate of historical loss experiences  information risks associated with the dependence upon timely and accurate risk ratings on loans  and risks associated with the dependence on collateral valuation techniques 
this category has been reduced from the previous year due to a reduction in these risks primarily resulting from the problem loan sale discussed previously as well as the positive credit quality trends in while management evaluates currently available information in establishing the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review a financial institution s allowance for loan losses and carrying amounts of other real estate owned 
such agencies may require the financial institution to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination

supplies and postage are down for the year ended december  compared to this decline results from efficiencies gained through the consolidation of the company s banking charters and ongoing efforts to reduce costs 
computer and data processing costs are down slightly in versus professional fees and services have declined for the year ended december  compare to  primarily a result of the resolution of asset quality issues and regulatory matters during other expenses decreased for the year ended december  the decline in other expenses related primarily to lower fdic insurance premiums  which declined million to  in versus million in the company also experienced a reduction in other operating expenses in  as one time severance and restructuring costs were incurred during to merge the company s subsidiary banks 
the efficiency ratio for the year ended december  was compared with for the improved efficiency ratio is reflective of the lower levels of noninterest expense  partially offset by lower revenues 
the efficiency ratio represents noninterest expense less other real estate expense and amortization of intangibles all from continuing operations divided by net interest income tax equivalent plus other noninterest income less gain on sale of securities  net gain on sale of commercial related loans held for sale and gain on sale of trust relationships all from continuing operations 

table of contents income tax expense benefit from continuing operations the income tax expense benefit from continuing operations provided for federal and new york state income taxes  which amounted to expense of million and a benefit of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the fluctuation in income tax expense corresponded in general with taxable income levels for each year 
the effective tax rate for was  compared to in the effective tax rate was due to the relationship between the size of the favorable permanent differences and pre tax income from continuing operations  which resulted in the unusual effective tax benefit rate 
the current and deferred tax provision was calculated based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified  which is generally before or during the third quarter of the subsequent year 
the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by federal and state tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity the objective of maintaining adequate liquidity is to assure the ability of the company to meet its financial obligations 
these obligations include the withdrawal of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity  the repayment of borrowings as they mature  the ability to fund new and existing loan commitments and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities 
the company achieves liquidity by maintaining a strong base of core customer funds  maturing short term assets  the ability to sell securities  lines of credit  and access to capital markets 
liquidity for the bank is managed through the monitoring of anticipated changes in loans  the investment portfolio  core deposits and wholesale funds 
the strength of the bank s liquidity position is a result of its base of core customer deposits 
these core deposits are supplemented by wholesale funding sources that include credit lines with the other banking institutions  the fhlb and the federal reserve bank

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain assets and liabilities  determine the appropriate level of risk to the company given its business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with the guidelines approved by fii s board of directors 
the company s management is responsible for reviewing with the board its activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on the net interest margin  the fair value of the portfolio and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on the portfolio and exposure limits 
management develops an asset liability policy that meets strategic objectives and regularly reviews the activities of the bank 
net interest income at risk analysis the primary tool the company uses to manage interest rate risk is a rate shock simulation to measure the rate sensitivity of the balance sheet 
rate shock simulation is a modeling technique used to estimate the impact of changes in rates on net interest income and economic value of equity 
the following table sets forth the results of the modeling analysis at december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates in basis points net interest income economic value of equity rate shock amount change change amount change change static the company measures net interest income at risk by estimating the changes in net interest income resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates of different magnitudes over a period of months 
as of december   a basis point increase in rates would decrease net interest income by million  or  over the next twelve month period 
a basis point decrease in rates would increase net interest income by million  or  over a twelve month period 
as of december   a basis point increase in rates would decrease the economic value of equity by million  or  over the next twelve month period 
a basis point decrease in rates would increase the economic value of equity by million  or  over a twelve month period 
this simulation is based on management s assumption as to the effect of interest rate changes on assets and liabilities and assumes a parallel shift of the yield curve 
it also includes certain assumptions about the future pricing of loans and deposits in response to changes in interest rates 

table of contents further  it assumes that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
while this simulation is a useful measure as to net interest income at risk due to a change in interest rates  it is not a forecast of the future results and is based on many assumptions that  if changed  could cause a different outcome 
in addition to the changes in interest rate scenarios listed above  the company typically runs other scenarios to measure interest rate risk  which vary depending on the economic and interest rate environments 
gap analysis the following table the gap table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  which management anticipates  based upon certain assumptions  to re price or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which re price or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the re pricing date or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected re pricing of assets and liabilities on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments within the selected time intervals 
all non maturity deposits demand deposits and savings deposits are subject to immediate withdrawal and are therefore shown to re price in the period of less than days 
prepayment and re pricing rates can have a significant impact on the estimated gap 
the results shown are based on numerous assumptions and there can be no assurance that the presented results will approximate actual future activity 
december  volumes subject to repricing within non dollars in thousands days days days years years years sensitive total interest earning assets federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits investment securities loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand  savings and money market certificates of deposit borrowed funds total interest bearing liabilities period gap cumulative gap period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets cumulative interest earning assets to cumulative interest bearing liabilities amounts shown include the amortized cost of held to maturity securities and the fair value of available for sale securities 
amounts shown include loans held for sale and are net of unearned income and net deferred fees and costs 
amounts shown include junior subordinated debentures 
for purposes of interest rate risk management  the company directs more attention on simulation modeling  such as net interest income at risk as previously discussed  rather than gap analysis 
the net interest income at risk simulation modeling is considered by management to be more informative in forecasting future income at risk
