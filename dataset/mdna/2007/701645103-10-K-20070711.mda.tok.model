item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with part i  including matters set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
on may   we announced a two for one stock split of common stock in the form of a dividend  for shareholders of record on may  the stock split 
the stock split was effected on june  and did not include shares held in treasury 
all discussions concerning common stock  earnings per share  and outstanding shares throughout this annual report on form k as well as comparable share information  have been adjusted to reflect the stock split 
in connection with the stock split  we modified outstanding warrants 
see note v to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the effect of the modification of warrants in connection with the stock split and the related non cash share based compensation expense recorded during the quarter ended june  overview parlux fragrances  inc is engaged in the business of creating  designing  manufacturing  distributing and selling prestige fragrances and beauty related products marketed primarily through specialty stores  national department stores and perfumeries on a worldwide basis 
the fragrance market is generally divided into a prestige group distributed primarily through department and specialty stores and a mass market group primarily chain drug stores  mass merchandisers  smaller perfumeries and pharmacies 
our fragrance products are positioned primarily in the prestige group 
we distribute certain brands through perfumania  a specialty retailer of fragrances in the united states and puerto rico  a wholly owned subsidiary of ecmv 
our former chairman and ceo had a significant shareholder interest in ecmv and held identical management positions until february  when he sold most of his shares in ecmv to the new majority owners  the nussdorfs 
shortly thereafter  mr 
lekach resigned from the ecmv board and was terminated as ceo  without cause  as a result of the change in management 
we previously maintained an approximate ownership interest in ecmv until we sold all of our shares in ecmv during august and september the nussdorf family acquired an approximate ownership interest in parlux during august and september and accordingly  all transactions with ecmv or perfumania will continue to be reported as related party transactions 
during the fiscal year ended march   we engaged in the manufacture through sub contractors  distribution and sale of paris hilton  guess  ocean pacific  maria sharapova  perry ellis and xoxo fragrances and grooming items on an exclusive basis as a licensee 
during december  we sold the perry ellis fragrance rights and other related assets to the licensor  perry ellis international pei 
we also had rights to distribute royal copenhagen fragrances in the us department store market until july  additionally  we previously manufactured  distributed and sold fred hayman beverly hills fhbh fragrances on a worldwide basis until we sublicensed these rights in we have recently expanded our product offerings under the paris hilton brand into the accessory market  specifically  watches  handbags  purses  small leather goods  and sunglasses 
such products  which have similar distribution channels to our fragrance products  could strengthen our position with our current customers and distributors while providing incremental sales volume 
the paris hilton and guess brands of fragrances and accessories accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our gross sales from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended march   and are expected to account for most of our gross sales in the year ending march  if paris hilton s appeal as a celebrity were to diminish  or guess would not approve shipments to our international distributors see licensing agreements for further discussion it could result in a material reduction in our sales of products licensed by them  adversely affecting our results of operations and operating cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates sec financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies as contemplated by frr see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
accounting for long lived assets 
the value of our long lived assets  including brand licenses and trademarks  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
we review long lived assets for impairment using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
the identification and measurement of impairment of long lived assets involves the estimation of the fair value of the related asset 
the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily incorporate management assumptions about discounted expected future cash flows 
future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions 
allowance for sales returns 
as is customary in the prestige fragrance industry  we grant most of our unrelated us department store customers the right to return product which does not sell through to consumers 
at the time of sale  we record a provision for estimated product returns based on our historical sell through experience  economic trends and changes in our assessment of customer demand 
based upon this information  we provide an allowance for sales returns 
it is generally after the specific gift giving season mother s day  christmas  etc 
that our customers request approval of the return for unsold items 
we decide to accept returns on a case by case basis 
there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the factors influencing the provision for returns and additional allowances in any particular period may be needed  if actual returns received exceeds estimates  reducing net sales 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover anticipated uncollectible accounts receivable  and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates  including a customer by customer review for large accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers  or any one customer  deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required 
inventory write downs 
we record inventory write downs for estimated obsolescence and shrinkage of inventory 
our estimates consider the cost of inventory  the estimated market value  the shelf life of the inventory and our historical experience 
if there are changes to these estimates  or changes in consumer preferences  additional inventory write downs may be necessary 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
if warranted  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period of such determination 
stock based compensation 
prior to april   we accounted for our compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
pro forma information regarding net income and net income per share was required in order to show our net income as if we had accounted for employee stock options under the fair value method of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition disclosure 
this information is contained in note v to our consolidated financial statements 
the fair values of options and shares issued pursuant to our plans at each grant date were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of stock options and similar equity instruments issued to employees 
previously  companies were required to calculate the estimated fair value of these share based payments and could elect to either include the estimated cost in earnings or disclose the pro forma effect in the footnotes to their financial statements 
as discussed above  we have chosen to disclose the pro forma effect 
the fair value concepts were not changed significantly in sfas no 
r  however  in adopting sfas no 
r  companies must choose among alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions 
the valuation model and amortization assumption used by us continues to be available 
sfas no 
r was effective for our fiscal year beginning april  transition options allow companies to choose whether to adopt prospectively  restate results to the beginning of the year  or to restate prior periods with the amounts that have been included in the footnotes 
we have adopted prospectively  and will continue to utilize the current black scholes option pricing model 
there were no unvested options or warrants outstanding at march   and as such  the result of adopting sfas no 
r on april   did not have an effect on our results of operations or financial position 
see note v to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the effect of the modification of outstanding warrants in connection with the stock split and the related non cash share based compensation expense recorded for the current fiscal year period 
since april  we have not made any changes of these critical accounting policies  nor have we made any material changes in any of the critical accounting estimates underlying these accounting policies other than the adoption of sfas r discussed above 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  requiring adoption by us during the quarter ending june  we are currently evaluating fin and have not yet determined the impact  if any  its adoption will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and disclosures in september  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no

in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab requires the combined use of a balance sheet approach and an income statement approach in evaluating whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors 
the company has adopted sab in the current year 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
significant trends over the last few years  a significant number of new prestige fragrance products have been introduced on a worldwide basis 
the beauty industry in general is highly competitive and consumer preferences often change rapidly 
the initial appeal of these new fragrances  launched for the most part in us department stores  has fueled the growth of our industry 
department stores continue to lose sales to the mass market as a product matures 
to counter the effect of lower department store sales  companies are required to introduce new products more quickly  which requires additional spending for development and advertising and promotional expenses 
in addition  a number of the new launches are with celebrities either entertainers or athletes which require substantial royalty commitments and whose careers and or appeal could change drastically  both positively and negatively  based on a single event 
we believe these trends will continue 
if on e or more of our new product introductions would be unsuccessful  or the appeal of the celebrity would diminish  it could result in a substantial reduction in profitability and operating cash flows 
in addition  certain us department store retailers have consolidated operations resulting in the closing of retail doors as well as implementing various inventory control initiatives 
we expect that these store closings and the inventory control initiatives will continue to affect our sales in the short term 
historically  as is the case for most fragrance companies  our sales have been influenced by seasonal trends generally related to holiday or gift giving periods 
substantial sales often occur during the final month of each quarter 
this practice assumes activities in future periods will support planned objectives  but there can be no assurance that will be achieved and future periods may be negatively affected 
results of operations on november   our board of directors approved the sale of the perry ellis fragrance brand license and related assets back to pei 
a definitive agreement was signed on december  and the sale close shortly thereafter 
see note to the accompanying financial statements for further discussion 
the results presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended march   and include activity relating to the perry ellis brand as discontinued operations 
for comparison purposes  prior period financial information in future filings will be restated accordingly 
our discussions below exclude perry ellis activities  which are addressed separately in the discussion of discontinued operations 
we do business with fragrance distributors owned operated by individuals related to our former chairman ceo 
these sales are included as related party sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and are closely monitored by management 
for the quarter ended september   we identified and classified additional international distributors as related parties 
these distributors had not previously been classified as such 
transactions with these distributors are now included as related party sales for the year ended march  and comparable period results  when applicable  have been restated 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
future sales to these parties may not occur at the same levels  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results if we are not successful in replacing sales with new customers or existing customers 
our gross margins may not be comparable to other entities that include all of the costs related to their distribution network in costs of goods sold  since we allocate a portion of these distribution costs to costs of goods sold and include the remaining unallocated amounts as selling and distribution expenses 
selling and distribution expenses for the years ended march   and include approximately   and  respectively  relating to the cost of warehouse operations not allocated to inventories and other related distribution expenses excluding shipping expenses which are recorded as cost of goods sold 
a portion of these costs is allocated to inventory in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
comparison of the year ended march  with the year ended march  during the year ended march   net sales increased to  as compared to  for the prior year 
the increase is mainly attributable to the launch of guess gold for women in september and the continued international rollout of guess women s fragrance  which originally shipped domestically during september  and guess men s fragrance which commenced shipping domestically in march  which provided  in gross sales compared to  in the prior year 
gross sales of paris hilton products increased to  compared to  primarily due to sales of the watch and handbag lines 
this was partially offset by a  reduction in gross sales of op brand products since no new products were introduced during the current period pending strategic direction from op s new owner 
warnaco  who acquired the op brand during  and subsequen tly sold the brand to iconics brand group  inc net sales to unrelated customers  which represent of our total net sales for the period  increased to  compared to  in the prior year  mainly as a result of the guess and paris hilton brand sales discussed above  offset by the reduction in op brand sales 
of this amount  net sales to the us department store sector increased from  to  while net sales to international distributors increased from  to  the increase in sales to us department stores was mainly attributable to a  increase in gross sales of guess products  partially offset by a reduction of  in gross sales of paris hilton brand products 
the increase in sales to international distributors was mainly attributable to an increase of  in gross sales of guess products  partially offset by a reduction of  in gross sales of paris hilton brand products 
sales to related parties see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of related parties increased to  compared to  in the prior year  mainly as a result of increases in guess and paris hilton brand gross sales of  and  respectively 
our overall cost of goods sold increased as a percentage of net sales to for the current fiscal year ended march   compared to in the prior year 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales to unrelated customers and related parties approximated and  respectively  for the current period  as compared to and  respectively  for the prior year 
the current year includes a higher percentage of sales to international distributors reflecting the continued rollout of paris hilton and guess products to international markets  which sales have a lower margin than sales of these products to us department store customers 
the current year also has a higher percentage of guess product sales  which sales  for the most part  have a lower margin than sales of our other products 
in addition  the current year also includes a higher percentage of value sets sold to both unrelated customers an d related parties  which include multiple products and have a higher cost of goods compared to basic stock items 
total operating expenses increased by compared to the prior year from  to  increasing as a percentage of net sales from to as a result of certain unusual and significant expenses described below 
however  certain individual components of our operating expenses experienced more significant changes 
advertising and promotional expenses increased to  compared to  in the prior year  decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the current year amount includes promotional costs in connection with the continued roll out of guess and paris hilton fragrances for women and men on a worldwide basis and the launch of the guess gold for women fragrance mainly in us department stores  respectively 
during january and february  we committed to certain spending levels in the u 
s 
department store channel based on projected sales 
however  due to the cons olidations and inventory controls measures discussed in significant trends above  sales to this channel were substantially less than originally anticipated and certain promotional activities during this year  which were committed to in advance  could not be cancelled 
we anticipate that promotional spending for the paris hilton and guess brands will continue at these levels during periods which contain new product launches 
selling and distribution costs increased to  compared to  in the prior year  increasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the increase was mainly attributable to approximately  and  in additional costs for temporary warehouse storage space  and freight charges for relocation of inventory to our new distribution center in new jersey  respectively  as well as approximately  and  for rent and personnel costs for the new jersey distribution center 
additional increases were incurred in headcount and travel expenses to support domestic department store sales growth 
royalties increased by in the current year  remaining constant as a percentage of net sales at  based upon the license requirements for the current sales mix  and minimum royalties for certain brands 
we anticipate that this percentage will decrease over time as additional sales of non fragrance products increase and minimum royalties on such licenses are absorbed 
general and administrative expenses increased compared to prior year  from  to  increasing as a percentage of sales from to 
the current period includes non cash  share based compensation charges in the amounts of  and  relating to fully vested warrants issued during the period from through  which were modified in connection with the stock split  and the recent consent solicitation settlement  respectively  see notes v and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the increase was also attributable to increases in legal fees  and settlement costs and other expenses  of approximately  in connection with various litigation and the recent consent solicitation see notes and  respectively  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
additional increases of  were incurred for professional fees relating to the special audit committee investigation as a result of allegations made in certain litigation and the sarbanes oxley act of remediation and maintenance  coupled with increases in property insurance costs and personnel additions in accounting  package development  quality assurance and production planning 
depreciation and amortization increased from  to  due to approximately  of new equipment and leasehold improvements at our new jersey facility being placed in service in september  offset by certain equipment becoming fully depreciated  as well as a  impairment charge for the xoxo fragrance license 
the current year period also includes a gain from the sale of the sunrise facility in the amount of  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
as a result of the above factors  we incurred an operating loss from continuing operations for the current year of  compared to operating income of  for the prior year 
net interest expense increased to  in the current year compared to  for the prior year  as we used our line of credit to finance higher receivables and inventory to support sales growth 
the current year period includes a gain from the sale of our investment in ecmv in the amount of  see note for further discussion 
loss from continuing operations before taxes for the current year was  compared to income of  in the prior year 
our tax provision for the prior year reflects an estimated effective rate of from continuing operations 
the effective rate in the current year of from continuing operations results from a limitation on the estimated deferred tax benefit that is expected to result from the share based compensation charge related to the warrant modification  and  the  loss for income tax purposes resulting from the sale of the ecmv shares due to a difference in basis see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the benefit from the share based compensation charge will be limited by the maximum allowable annual compensation deduction for certain corporate officers under section m of the internal revenue code 
consequently  the benefit recorded in the current year reflects management s best estimate at the present time based upon assumptions regarding the timing and market value of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants and the amount and nature of other forms of compensation to be paid to the holders of the warrants using the method in which cash compensation salary and bonus of the related individuals takes priority over the share based compensation in determining the annual limitation 
actual tax benefits realized may be greater or less than the amounts recorded  and such differences may be material 
we will adjust this deferred tax asset as additional information becomes available  with adjustments reflected in our income tax benefit provision for the period in which the adjustments are identified 
as a result  we incurred a net loss from continuing operations of  for the current year compared to net income of  in the prior year 
income from discontinued operations  which includes a pretax gain of  in the current year from the sale of our perry ellis fragrance brand and the related assets see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion  net of the tax effect  was  and  for the years ended march  and  respectively 
as a result  we earned net income of  and  for the current and prior year  respectively 
comparison of the year ended march  with the year ended march  during the year ended march   net sales from continuing operations quadrupled to  as compared to  for the prior year 
the increase was mainly attributable to the continuation of the worldwide launch of paris hilton fragrances for women and men  which commenced shipping in october and april  respectively  coupled with the initial shipment in september of the second paris hilton fragrance for women  just me and december of just me for men  generating  in gross sales for the entire paris hilton fragrance brand during excluding  and  in paris hilton brand watch and handbag sales  respectively as compared to  for the same period in the prior year  the launch of guess women s fragrance during june  and men s fragrance during march  which provided a total of  in gross sales   in gross sales of xoxo brand products  which license was acquired during january  as compared to gross sales of  during fiscal  and the initial shipments in september of maria sharapova women s fragrance  which provided gross sales of  the increase was partially offset by a  reduction in gross sales of ocean pacific op brand products  since no major launches were introduced during pending strategic direction from warnaco  who acquired the op brand during net sales to unrelated customers increased to  compared to  for  mainly as a result of increases in paris hilton and guess brand sales discussed above in the amount of  and  respectively  offset by a reduction of  in op brand sales 
sales to related parties increased to  compared to  in  mainly as a result of increases in paris hilton and guess brand sales in the amount of  and  respectively  partially offset by a reduction of  in op brand sales and a  reduction for jockey  fhbh and chaleur de animale brand sales  which brands are no longer licensed or distributed by us 
our overall cost of goods sold decreased as a percentage of net sales to for the year ended march  compared to for the prior year 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales to unrelated customers and related parties approximated and  respectively  for  as compared to and  respectively  for the reduction in cost of goods as a percentage of net sales is due primarily to the shipment of paris hilton and guess products to unrelated parties  including us department stores  where our margins are significantly higher 
in addition  sales to related parties in included  of closeout sales 
such closeout sales were at significantly reduced margins 
operating expenses increased by compared to from  to  decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
however  certain individual components of our operating expenses experienced more significant changes as we invested in our new product launches 
advertising and promotional expenses more than tripled to  compared to  in  decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the year ended march  includes approximately  and  of promotional costs in connection with the continued roll out of paris hilton fragrances for women and men and the guess women s and men s fragrance launches  respectively  which substantially exceed required promotional spending under these two license agreements 
selling and distribution costs increased to  compared to  in  decreasing as a percentage o f net sales from to 
the increase was mainly attributable to additional costs for temporary warehouse storage space to handle the increased order flow and inventory requirements  coupled with an increase in domestic sales headcount and travel expenses to support the increased sales in this distribution channel 
royalties increased from  to  increasing from to of net sales  in line with license requirements for the current sales mix and minimum royalties for certain brands 
general and administrative expenses increased compared to  from  to  while decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the increase was mainly attributable to increases in audit and professional fees in connection with the first year of sarbanes oxley implementation  health and property insurance  and personnel additions in package development  quality assurance and production planning 
depreciation and amortization increased from   to  a full year s amortization of intangibles relating to the january xoxo license acquisition see note b to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion was offset by a reduction in depreciation for certain fully depreciated molds and equipment 
as a result of the above factors  operating income from continuing operations increased to  compared to an operating loss of  for net interest expense was  in as compared to net interest income of  for the prior year as we used our line of credit to finance the increase in receivables and inventory in support of our continuing sales growth 
income from continuing operations before taxes for was  compared to a loss of  in the prior year 
giving effect to the tax provision  which reflects an effective rate of from continuing operations  we earned net income from continuing operations of  compared to a loss of  in the approximate reduction from the effective income tax rate in was mainly attributable to the increase in international sales activity  resulting in additional foreign source income excludable for federal income tax purposes 
this tax benefit phased out for the year ended march   replaced by new provisions based on manufacturing criteria 
income from discontinued operations  which relates to the perry ellis fragrance brand see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion  net of the tax effect  was  and  for the years ended march  and  respectively 
as a result  we earned net income of  and  for the current and prior comparable periods  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources working capital decreased to  as of march   compared to  at march  the increase was mainly attributable to the current period s net income  excluding the effect of the non cash compensation charge  offset by the approximate million in fixed asset additions financed by capital leases of which approximately  have current maturities  the reduction in investment in affiliate as a result of the sale of the shares of e com ventures  inc for less than the march  carrying value and the classification of a portion of our inventory as non current 
during the year ended march   net cash used in operating activities was  compared to  during the prior year 
the increase was mainly attributable to a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in inventory to support the increased sales anticipated for the paris hilton and guess brands  partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts receivable 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of the current year  we paid approximately million toward estimated income taxes  due to the sale of the perry ellis fragrance license and other related assets 
we anticipate receiving a significant refund from this amount during fiscal net cash provided by investing activities increased to  in the current year from a use of  in the prior year  due to a change in restricted cash pending transfer to our lender and the net proceeds from the sales of the perry ellis brand  the sunrise facility and our investment in affiliate 
this was partially offset by the increased purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
net cash used in financing activities increased to  in the current year compared to net cash provided by financial activities of  in the prior year 
the decrease was attributable to the pay down of a portion of our line of credit and the repayment of the  balance of the mortgage concurrently with the sale of the sunrise facility 
we had  of treasury stock purchases in the current year compared with  in the prior year 
as of march  and  our ratios of the number of days sales in accounts receivable and number of days cost of sales in inventory  on an annualized basis  were as follows march  trade accounts receivable unrelated related perfumania other related total receivables inventories accounts receivable balances and the number of days sales in accounts receivable do not exclude perry ellis activity since such activity is not brand specific 
calculated on gross trade receivables excluding allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and advertising allowances of approximately  and  in and  respectively 
the decrease in the number of days sales from to for unrelated customers was mainly attributable to improved collections from international distributors  a portion of which was past due as of march  terms for such distributors  for the most part  range from to days  compared to between and days for us department store customers 
based on current circumstances  we anticipate the number of days for the unrelated customer group will range between and days during fiscal the number of days sales in trade receivables from perfumania continue to exceed those of unrelated customers  due mainly to their seasonal cash flow see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our relationship with perfumania 
the number of days outstanding has improved slightly as of march  the number of days sales in trade receivables from other related parties conti nue to be less than their or day payment terms 
the lead time for certain of our raw materials and components inventory up to days requires us to maintain at least a three to six month supply of some items in order to ensure production schedules 
in addition  when we launch a new brand or stock keeping unit  we frequently produce a six to nine month supply to ensure adequate inventories if the new products exceed our forecasted expectations 
we believe that the gross margins on our products outweigh the additional carrying costs 
however  if future sales do not reach forecasted levels  it could result in excess inventories and may require us to decrease prices to reduce inventory levels 
due to the significant number of new product launches during fiscal year  and the forecasted sales increases for these products  in particular  the guess branded products  the number of days sales in inventory has increased 
we anticipate that this trend will improve over the next two quarters  as these launched products reach full distribution and guess approves additional international distribution channels see licensing agreements for further discussion 
as of march    of our inventory  including  related to guess brand products  has been classified as non current 
however  if inventory levels remain relatively high they may warrant further attention and additional inventory write downs may be necessary 
we have revised our production and purchasing forecasts in order to improve our inventory management and believe that the carrying value of our inventory at march   based on current conditions  is stated at the lower of cost or market 
as of march   we had repurchased  under all phases of our common stock buy back program  a total of  shares at a cost of  on august   our board of directors the board approved the repurchase of an additional  shares of our common stock  subject to certain limitations  including approval from our lender  which was subsequently  received  for up to  on august  as of march   we had repurchased  in the open market   shares at a cost of  including  shares at a cost of  during the period april  through march  during december  we purchased  in the open market  an additional  shares at a cost of  effectively completing share repurchases approved under this authorization 
on january   our board approved the repurchase of an additional  shares  subject to certain limitations  including approval from our lender if we had amounts outstanding under our line of credit 
at that time  the august  repurchase plan was effectively terminated with approximately  remaining 
as of june   we had repurchased  in the open market   shares at a cost of  all of which was purchased during january on july   we entered into a loan and security agreement the loan agreement with gmac commercial credit llc gmaccc 
on january   the loan agreement was extended through july  under the loan agreement  we were able to borrow  depending upon the availability of a borrowing base  on a revolving basis  up to  at an interest rate of libor plus or the bank of new york s prime rate  at our option 
on january   the loan agreement was amended  increasing the credit line to  with an additional  available at our option 
the maturity was extended to july   and the interest rate was reduced to below the prime rate 
during may  we exercised our option and increased the line to  on september   the loan agreement was further amended  temporarily increasing the credit line to  until december   at which time the maximum loan amount reverted back to  at march   based on the borrowing base at that date  available borrowing under the credit line amounted to  of which   as of june  was utilized 
restricted cash represents collections of trade accounts receivable deposited with our bank and pending transfer to gmaccc 
as of march  and   and  respectively  was on deposit with our bank pending transfer 
substantially all of our assets  other than those recently financed under a capital leases with provident equipment leasing and ibm see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion  collateralize our credit line borrowing 
the loan agreement contains customary events of default and covenants which prohibit  among other things  incurring additional indebtedness in excess of a specified amount  paying dividends  creating liens  and engaging in mergers and acquisitions without the prior consent of gmaccc 
the loan agreement also contains certain financial covenants relating to net worth  interest coverage and other financial ratios 
although we substantially exceeded the net worth covenant  we were not in compliance with the fixed charge covenant as of march  we requested an amendment of our agreement from our lender  which was granted on june   and which revised such covenant t hrough march  on december   we obtained a  mortgage loan from ge finance business property corporation for the sunrise facility see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
this mortgage was repaid on june   concurrently with the sale of the property 
as previously discussed  we sold the perry ellis fragrance brand and related assets during december this brand represented approximately of our total gross sales during the year ended march  we are currently reviewing alternatives to reduce operating expenses to levels that are more in line with our current requirements 
the actions being considered include reductions in advertising expenses and personnel as well as subleasing the warehouse and storage portion of our ft 
lauderdale florida location  or moving from this location to office space in south florida 
management believes that funds from operations and our existing financing will be sufficient to meet our current operating needs 
however  if we were to continue incurring operating losses  or were to expand operations through acquisitions  new licensing arrangements or both  we may need to obtain additional financing 
there is no assurance that we could obtain such financing or what the terms of such financing  if available  would be
