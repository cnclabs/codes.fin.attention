litigation settlement in february   we entered into a settlement agreement and related license agreement with dr 
mark l 
kozam d b a mlk software and datasci  llc 
the settlement agreement relates to a lawsuit filed by datasci in alleging that certain of our products and services and certain products and services of one of our customers  quintiles  inc  infringe a united states patent claimed to be owned by datasci 
under the settlement agreement and related license agreement  we agreed to make a one time  lump sum payment to datasci in the amount of million to settle the claim and obtain a perpetual  irrevocable  fully paid worldwide  non exclusive license to the patent that was the subject of the claim by datasci 
the confidential settlement  in which neither party admits liability  provides for mutual releases and dismissal of all actions between the parties 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we reviewed the attributes of the license obtained and estimated that the license obtained had no value or useful life and that the license would not contribute to our future cash flows  either directly or indirectly 
in addition we do not anticipate changing any of our products as a result of the license to this patent 
as such  the settlement amount was recorded as a charge to operations 
since the contingency existed as of december  and the settlement was concluded prior to the issuance of our audited consolidated financial statements  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we recorded the impact of the settlement in as a charge to operations 
the settlement was paid during the three months ended march  sources of revenues we derive our revenues from software licenses and services 
license revenues are derived principally from the sale of term licenses for our software products including  inform  clintrial  clintrace  webvdme  ctsd and websdm 
service revenues are derived principally from our delivery of the hosted solution of our inform  webvdme  ctsd and websdm software products  and consulting services and customer support  including training  for all of our products 
we generally recognize revenues ratably over the life of a license or service contract 
this allows us to maintain a backlog that provides multi year visibility in revenues 
one customer  glaxosmithkline  accounted for approximately and of our total revenues in the years and  respectively  and million and million of accounts receivable outstanding as of december  and  respectively 
our top customers accounted for approximately and of our total revenues  net of reimbursable out of pocket expenses  in the years and  respectively 
license revenues we derive our license revenues from the following products inform  our internet based electronic data capture  or edc  solution  clintrial  our clinical data management solution  and our drug safety solutions  including our clintrace  webvdme  ctsd  and websdm products 
although each of our software solutions is available as a stand alone enterprise application  we offer integrated enterprise solutions incorporating certain of our electronic data capture  data management and drug safety products 
license revenues for our inform electronic data capture software solution  either on a stand alone or integrated basis  are determined primarily by the number  complexity and duration of the clinical trials and the number of participants in each clinical trial 
license revenues for our clintrial  clintrace  webvdme  ctsd and websdm software solutions are determined primarily by the number of users accessing the software solution 
except as discussed below  we enter into software license agreements for our inform  clintrial and clintrace products with terms generally of three to five years with payment terms generally annually in advance 
license agreements for our webvdme  ctsd and websdm products are generally annual or multi year with payment terms generally annually in advance 
license revenues are recognized ratably over the duration of the software term license agreement  to the extent that amounts are fixed or determinable and collectable 
following our acquisition of clinsoft in august  we began converting holders of clinsoft perpetual software licenses to our software term license arrangements 
we continue to sell perpetual licenses of these products in certain situations to our existing customers with the option to purchase customer support  and may in the future do so for new customers based on customer requirements or market conditions 
we recognize revenues on the perpetual licenses upon delivery of the software when all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we continue to provide and charge for maintenance and support on our products to those customers who do not convert to our software term license arrangements 
we generally charge of the perpetual license fee for customer support 
we will continue our efforts to convert the remaining former clinsoft customer base to software term license arrangements 
however  we anticipate that some customers will not convert and instead will continue to make annual customer support payments 
service revenues application hosting services 
in addition to making our software products available to customers through licenses  we offer our inform  webvdme  ctsd and websdm software as hosted application solutions delivered through a standard web browser  with customer support and training services 
service revenues from application hosting services are derived principally from our inform hosted solution 
revenues resulting from the inform hosting service consist of three stages for each clinical trial first stage trial and application set up  including design of electronic case report forms and edit checks  installation and server configuration of the system  second stage application hosting and related support services  and third stage services required to close out  or lock  the database for the clinical trial 
services provided for the first and third stages are provided on a fixed fee basis depending upon the complexity of the trial and system requirements 
services for the second stage are charged separately as a fixed monthly fee 
we recognize revenues from all stages of the hosting service ratably over the hosting period 
fees charged and costs incurred for the trial system design  set up and implementation are deferred until the start of the hosting period and are amortized and recognized ratably over the estimated hosting period 
the deferred costs include direct costs related to the trial and application set up 
fees for the first and third stages of the services are billed based upon milestones 
fees for application hosting and related services in the second stage are generally billed quarterly in advance 
bundled into this revenue element are the revenues attributable to the software license used by the customer 
in the event that an application hosting customer cancels a clinical trial and its related statement of work  all deferred revenues are recognized and all deferred set up costs are expensed 
in addition  certain termination related fees may be charged and if so  such fees are recognized in the period of termination 
revenues resulting from hosting services for our webvdme  ctsd and websdm products consist of installation and server configuration  application hosting and related support services 
services for this offering are charged monthly as a fixed fee 
revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the service 
in addition  application hosting service revenues include hosting services associated with term license customers and reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
consulting services 
consulting services include the design and documentation of the processes related to our customers use of our products and services in their clinical trials 
consulting services also include project planning and management services  guidance on best practices in using our software products  data management and configuration services for data mining and reporting  as well as implementation services consisting of application architecture design  systems integration  installation and validation 
revenues from consulting services included in either a multiple element software license agreement or in an application hosting agreement are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
the associated costs are expensed as incurred 
revenues from consulting services that are not included in a multiple element software license arrangement are recognized as services are performed 
fixed priced arrangements are billed based upon contractual milestones  and time and materials arrangements are billed monthly 
customer support 
we have a multinational services organization to support our software products and hosted solutions worldwide 
customer support includes telephone support  software maintenance and training 
we bundle customer support in our software term licenses and allocate of the value of the license to customer support revenues 
our customer support revenues also consist of customer support fees paid by perpetual license customers 
customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the customer support or term license agreement  with payment terms generally annually in advance 
cost of revenues and operating expenses we allocate overhead expenses such as rent and occupancy charges and employee benefit costs to all departments based on headcount 
as such  general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of service revenues and in the sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expense categories 
cost of revenues 
cost of license revenues consists primarily of the amortization of royalties paid for certain modules within our clintrial software product as well as our inform software product 
in addition  costs of revenues include expense for the amortization of acquired technologies associated with the acquisition of lincoln 
the cost of license revenues vary based upon the mix of revenues from software licenses for our products 
we operate our service organization on a global basis as one distinct unit  and do not segment costs for our various service revenue elements 
these services include performing application hosting  consulting and customer support services 
costs for these services consist primarily of employee related costs associated with these services  amortization of the deferred clinical trial set up costs  allocated overhead  outside contractors  royalties associated with providing customer support for use with the clintrial and inform software products and reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
cost of services also includes hosting costs that primarily consist of hosting facility fees and server depreciation 
the cost of service revenue varies based upon the number of employees in the service organization  the type of work performed  and royalties associated with revenues derived from providing customer support  as well as costs associated with the flexible use of outside contractors to support internal resources 
we supplement the trial design and set up activity for our inform application hosting services through the use of outside contractors 
this allows us to utilize outside contractors in those periods where trial design and set up activity is highest while reducing the use of outside contractors in those periods where trial activity lessens  allowing for a more flexible delivery model 
the percentage of the services workforce represented by outside contractors varies from period to period depending on the volume of specific support required 
the cost of services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenues as compared to our cost of license revenues primarily due to the employee related and outside contractor expenses associated with providing services 
gross margin 
our gross margin on license revenues varies based on the mix of royalty and non royalty bearing license revenues and the amount of amortization of acquired technologies 
our gross margin on service revenues varies primarily due to variations in the utilization levels of the professional service team and the timing of expense and revenue recognition under our service arrangements 
in situations where the service revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term our costs associated with delivery of the services are recognized as the services are performed  which is typically during the first to months of the contract period 
accordingly  our gross margin on service revenues will vary significantly over the life of a contract due to the timing  amount and type of service required in delivering certain projects 
in addition  consolidated gross margin will vary depending upon the mix of license and service revenues 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  including travel  marketing programs which include product marketing expenses such as trade shows  workshops and seminars  corporate communications  other brand building and advertising  allocated overhead and the amortization of commissions 
in addition  sales and marketing include expense for the amortization of acquired technologies associated with the acquisition of lincoln 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as commission expense increases with our revenues and as we continue to expand sales coverage and to build brand awareness through what we believe are the most cost effective channels available  but may fluctuate quarter over quarter due to the timing of marketing programs 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  allocated overhead and outside contractors 
we focus our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality  performance and integration of our software products 
we expect that in the future  research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to add features and functionality to our products  introduce additional integrated software solutions to our product suite and expand our product and service offering 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  professional fees  primarily consisting of expenses for accounting  compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and legal services  including litigation  information technology and other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect that in the future our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business and operations 
restructuring 
we recorded a million restructuring charge in which related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters 
this charge includes approximately million relating to the estimated future obligation under the non cancelable lease and an approximate million write off of the related abandoned leasehold improvements and fixed assets 
as of september   payments for all remaining expenses were completed and as a result we recorded a restructuring benefit of  representing the elimination of accrued expenses associated with the restructuring charge 
stock based compensation expenses 
our cost of service revenues  sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses include stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense is the fair value of outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards which are recognized over the respective stock option and award service periods 
it also includes amortization of the excess of the deemed fair market value over the exercise price of stock options granted prior to when we became a public company 
during the years  and  we recorded million   and million of aggregate stock based compensation expense  respectively 
foreign currency translation with regard to our international operations  we frequently enter into transactions in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  our revenues  expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the euro  british pound  australian dollar and japanese yen 
in and  approximately and  respectively  of our revenues were generated in locations outside the united states 
the majority of these revenues are in currencies other than the us dollar  as are many of the associated expenses 
in periods when the us dollar declines in value as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business  our foreign currency based revenues and expenses generally increase in value when translated into us dollars 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions with our audit committee  including those related to revenue recognition  deferred set up costs  commissions and royalties  accounts receivable reserves  stock based compensation expenses  long lived assets  intangibles assets and goodwill  income taxes  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there have been no material changes to these estimates for the periods presented in this annual report 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition and deferred set up costs 
we recognize software license revenues in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants  while revenues resulting from application services are recognized in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware and securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
on august   we adopted eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
customers generally have the ability to terminate application hosting  consulting and training service agreements upon days notice 
license agreements  multiple element arrangements  including license and services agreements and certain application hosting services can generally be terminated by either party for material breach of obligations not corrected within days after notice of the breach 
we recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product or service has been provided to the customer  the collection of our fees is probable  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
we generally enter into software term licenses for our inform  clintrial and clintrace products with our customers for to year periods 
license agreements for our webvdme  ctsd and websdm products are generally annual or multi year terms 
these arrangements typically include multiple elements software license  consulting services and customer support 
we bill our customers in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract 
generally  we bill license fees annually in advance for each year of the license term 
our payment terms are generally net days 
our software license revenues are earned from the sale of off the shelf software requiring no significant modification or customization subsequent to delivery to the customer 
consulting services  which can also be performed by third party consultants  are deemed to be non essential to the functionality of the software and typically are for trial configuration  implementation planning  loading of software  building simple interfaces and running test data and documentation of procedures 
we generally bundle customer support with the software license for the entire term of the arrangement 
as a result  we generally recognize revenues for all elements  including consulting services  ratably over the term of the software license and support arrangement 
we allocate the revenues recognized for these arrangements to the different elements based on management s estimate of the relative fair value of each element 
for our term based licenses  we allocate to consulting services the anticipated service effort and value throughout the term of the arrangement at an amount that would have been allocated had those services been sold separately to the customer 
the remaining value is allocated to license and support services  with of this amount allocated to support services 
we have allocated the estimated fair value to our multiple element arrangements to provide meaningful disclosures about each of our revenue streams 
the costs associated with the consulting and customer support services are expensed as incurred 
there are instances in which we sell software licenses based on usage levels 
these software licenses can be based on estimated usage  in which case the license fee charged to the customer is fixed based on this estimate 
when the fee is fixed  the revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement 
if the fee is based on actual usage  and therefore variable  the revenues are recognized in the period of use 
revenues from certain follow on consulting services  which are sold separately to customers with existing software licenses and are not considered part of a multiple element arrangement  are recognized as the services are performed 
we continue to sell perpetual licenses for the clintrial and clintrace software products in certain situations to our existing customers with the option to purchase customer support and may in the future do so for new customers based on customer requirements or market conditions 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the customer support 
accordingly  license revenues are recognized upon delivery of the software and when all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the underlying support arrangement 
we continue to generate customer support and maintenance revenues from our perpetual license customer base 
training revenues are recognized as earned 
in addition to making our software products available to customers through licenses  we offer our inform  webvdme  ctsd and websdm software solutions through a hosted application solution delivered through a standard web browser 
revenues resulting from inform application hosting services consists of three stages for each clinical trial the first stage involves application set up  including design of electronic case report forms and edit checks  implementation of the system and server configuration  the second stage involves application hosting and related support services  and the third stage involves services required to close out  or lock  the database for the clinical trial 
services provided for the first and third stages are provided on a fixed fee basis based upon the complexity of the trial and system requirements 
services for the second stage are charged separately as a fixed monthly fee 
we recognize revenues from all stages of the inform hosting service ratably over the hosting period 
fees charged and costs incurred for the trial system design  set up and implementation are deferred as applicable  until the start of the hosting period and then amortized and recognized  as applicable  ratably over the estimated hosting period 
the deferred costs include incremental direct costs with third parties and certain internal direct costs related to the trial and application set up  as defined under sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and indirect costs of leases 
these costs include salary and benefits associated with direct labor costs incurred during trial set up  as well as third party subcontract fees and other contract labor costs 
work performed outside the original scope of work is contracted for separately as an additional fee and is generally recognized ratably over the remaining term of the hosting period 
fees for the first and third stages of the services are billed based upon milestones 
fees for application hosting and related services in the second stage are billed quarterly in advance 
bundled into this revenue element are the revenues attributable to the software license used by the customer 
revenues resulting from hosting services for our webvdme  ctsd and websdm products consist of installation and server configuration  application hosting and related support services 
services for this offering are charged monthly as a fixed fee 
revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the service 
in the event that an application hosting customer cancels a clinical trial and its related statement of work  all deferred revenues are recognized and all deferred set up costs are expensed 
in addition  certain termination related fees may be charged and if so  such fees are recognized in the period of termination 
we deferred million  million and million of set up costs and amortized million  million and million during the years  and  respectively 
the amortization of deferred set up costs is a component of cost of services 
deferred revenues represent amounts billed or cash received in advance of revenue recognition 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made on a contract by contract basis and are recognized in the period in which such losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
to date  we have not experienced any material losses on uncompleted application hosting contracts 
accounting for prepaid sales commissions and royalties 
for arrangements where we recognize revenues over the relevant contract period  we defer related commission payments to our direct sales force and software license royalties paid to third parties and amortize these amounts over the same period that the related revenues are recognized 
this is done to better match commission and royalty expenses with the related revenues 
we deferred million  million and million of commissions and amortized to sales and marketing expense million  million and million during the years  and  respectively 
royalties are paid on a percentage of billings basis for certain of our products  and we have the right to recover royalties in the event an arrangement is cancelled 
we deferred million  million and million of royalties and amortized to cost of revenues million  million and million during the years  and  respectively 
accounts receivable reserves 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors  which may include dialogue with the customer to determine the cause of non payment  the use of collection agencies  and or the use of litigation 
in the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to meet its full obligation to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount that we expect to recover given all information available to us 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our accounts receivable reserves were   and  as of december   and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes 
in connection with preparing our financial statements  we are required to compute income tax expense in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process requires that we project our current tax liability and estimate our deferred tax assets and liabilities  including net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we have considered our recent operating results  future taxable income projections and all prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize a portion of our deferred tax assets and therefore reduced the valuation allowance by million in december this benefit of the release in valuation allowance was realized through reductions to income tax expense of million and to goodwill of million for the realization of acquired net operating loss carryforwards in the clinsoft acquisition 
in  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize an additional portion of our deferred tax assets and therefore reduced the valuation allowance by million 
this benefit of the release in valuation allowance was realized through reductions to income tax expense of million and to goodwill of  also in  we utilized million of our deferred tax assets to offset taxable income 
the net effect of these changes resulted in a decrease to the valuation allowance of million 
accounting for stock based awards 
on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires us to recognize expense related to the fair value of stock based compensation awards 
we elected to use the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas no 
r and therefore have not restated our financial results for prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted on or after march  the filing date for the initial registration statement for our initial public offering  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
stock options granted prior to march   are minimum value options  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  the value of these options will not be recorded in the statement of operations subsequent to the date of our adoption of sfas no 
r 
instead  we will continue to account for these options using accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
for service based options  accounted for under sfas no 
r  we recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
for performance based options  we recognize expense on a straight line basis over the estimated performance period 
in addition  sfas r requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized share based compensation to be reported as a financing activity rather than an operating activity in the statements of cash flows 
this requirement can have the effect of reducing our net operating cash flows and increasing our net financing cash flows in certain periods 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we applied sfas no 
 amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which allowed companies to apply the existing accounting rules under apb opinion no 
pursuant to apb opinion no 
 we accounted for our stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method  under which compensation expense was measured on the date of grant as the difference between the fair value of our common stock and the option exercise price multiplied by the number of options granted 
generally  we granted stock options with exercise prices equal to the estimated fair value of our common stock  however  to the extent that the fair value of the common stock exceeded the exercise price of stock options granted to employees on the date of grant  we recorded deferred compensation and amortized the expense over the vesting schedule of the options  generally four years 
during and  in accordance with apb opinion no 
 we recorded deferred stock based compensation resulting from the grant of employee stock options with an exercise price less than the fair value of common stock 
as of december   we had  of deferred stock based compensation remaining to be amortized which we expect to be amortized as follows  during and  during effective with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we have elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of options granted 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
during and  we recorded  and million of aggregate stock based compensation expense respectively  of which and million  respectively  was a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
the remaining stock based compensation expense is due to the amortization of stock based compensation associated with previously issued stock options which amounted to  and  in and  respectively 
for  we allocated stock based compensation expense as follows  to cost of service revenues   to research and development   to sales and marketing  and  to general and administrative 
for  we allocated stock based compensation expense as follows  in cost of revenues   in research and development   in sales and marketing and million in general and administrative expense 
for  stock based compensation expense had no effect on earnings per share 
for  stock based compensation expense reduced basic and diluted earnings per share by and  respectively 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to market based share awards that we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 
other significant estimates goodwill and intangible assets impairment 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets periodically based upon the expected future discounted operating cash flows of our business 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of our operating results in future periods 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the timing and size of impairment charges  if any  involves the application of management s judgment regarding the estimates and could significantly affect our operating results 
restructuring 
we recorded a million restructuring charge in which related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters 
this charge includes approximately million relating to the estimated future obligation under the non cancelable lease and an approximate million write off of the related abandoned leasehold improvements and fixed assets 
as of march   payments for all remaining expenses were completed and as a result we recorded a benefit of  representing the elimination of accrued expenses associated with the restructuring charge 
overview of results of operations for the years ended december  and in  we signed contracted orders of million compared to million in  an increase of 
our backlog grew in to million at december   an increase of from million of backlog at december  the license portion of our backlog increased from million at december  to million at december   representing a increase 
the service portion of our backlog increased by during this same period from million to million 
in the future  we anticipate that the percentage of the license and service components of our backlog will fluctuate as a percentage of total backlog  primarily due to changes in the type  amounts and delivery schedules of license and service orders  which are based on the requirements of our customers 
approximately million of the december  total backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue in approximately of the value of our backlog as of december  represented contract commitments that may be cancelled by our customers at any time with limited notice 
based on historical cancellations since the inception of our company in  of the value of our total backlog is expected to be canceled prior to completion 
total revenues increased by or million in compared to the same period in primarily due to an increase in service revenues of 
our gross margin increased by or million in compared to the same period in  primarily due to the increase in revenues 
operating income in of million increased by million compared to the same period in the operating income in included an million charge relating to a litigation settlement 
the operating income for and also included  and million of stock based compensation expense  respectively 
the results for were impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations  resulting in a decrease in revenue for the period of and no impact of expenses 
revenues year ended december  change revenues amount percentage of revenues amount percentage of revenues amount in thousands license application hosting services consulting services customer support total total revenues increased in as compared to the same period in  primarily due to increases in application hosting and license revenues 
the increase in revenues associated with our application hosting services in was primarily due to an increase in trials under management  which include both application hosting services trials as well as trials hosted for our inform license customers 
the increase in license revenues was the result of growth across all of our products but was primarily the result of additional inform revenue from both new and existing customers 
the increase in consulting revenues was primarily attributable to additional inform revenues which were related to both new and existing customers as well as services relating to new business relationships relating to the webvdme product we began offering after the august acquisition of lincoln 
the increase in customer support revenues in was primarily due to an increase in inform customer support revenues 
our revenues were not significantly impacted by price increases or decreases

in addition  there was an increase in revenue from consulting services performed on a time and material basis for some of our enterprise customers  rather than services performed under bundled arrangements 
when services are performed on a time and material basis  the timing of expense and revenue recognition is more closely aligned than when services are performed under bundled arrangements  where the revenue is recognized ratably over the license period  while the expenses are recognized as incurred 
it is likely that gross margin  as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate quarter by quarter due to the timing and mix of license and service revenues  and the type  amount and timing of service required in delivering certain projects

the increase in consulting revenue was primarily attributable to services relating to inform as well as new business relating to the webvdme product we began offering after the august acquisition of lincoln 
the increase in revenue associated with the hosted application of our inform product in was due to an increase in trials under management  which include both application hosting services trials as well as trials hosted for our inform license customers 
the decrease in customer support revenue in was due primarily to a reduction in the clintrial maintenance renewal base as a result of the conversion of the former clinsoft customers to term based licenses that have a lower customer support fee  partially offset by an increase in inform support due to an increase in inform training revenue

we also had expense increases for depreciation and computer related expenses of  and  respectively  which were the result of having more trials under management in as compared to computer related expenses include hardware and software support agreements as well as computer accessories 
these increases were partially offset by a benefit of trial set up expense net of amortization of  associated with an increase in trials in the set up phase for application hosting service arrangements  for which the associated expenses were deferred and recognized over the duration of the trial  rather than expensed as incurred

sales and marketing expenses increased in primarily due to a  increase in employee related expenses related to a headcount increase of people and personnel changes  and a  increase in commission expense due to both an increase in revenues and an increase in the effective commission rate 
other increases in marketing programs and related expense of  and contractor expense of  were partially offset by a decrease in occupancy expense of  research and development 
research and development expenses increased in primarily due to employee related expenses of million  resulting from a full year of expense relating to a headcount increase of people that occurred in  as well as incremental expense associated with a headcount increase of people that occurred in this increase was partially offset by a reduction in outside contractor expense of  as we brought certain research and development activities in house 
general and administrative

in addition  outside contractor expenses increased  primarily related to preparation for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of further expense increases included employee related expenses of  related to a headcount increase of people  computer and related expenses of  and taxes and fees of  these expense increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense of million 
litigation settlement 
on february   we entered into the settlement agreement and related license agreement described above in this section under the heading litigation settlement to settle litigation concerning allegations that we infringed a patent claimed to be owned by a third party 
under the settlement agreement and related license agreement  we agreed to make a one time  lump sum payment of million to settle the claim and obtain a perpetual  irrevocable  fully paid  worldwide  non exclusive license to the patent that was the subject of the claim by datasci 
since the contingency existed as of december  and the settlement was concluded prior to the issuance of our audited consolidated financial statements  in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded the impact of the settlement in as a charge to operations 
we do not anticipate changing any of our products as a result of the license to this patent 
we incurred expense of approximately million in each of and relating to our defense in this suit  which is included in general and administrative expense 
operating income loss year ended december  change amount percentage of revenues amount percentage of revenues amount in thousands operating income operating income loss 
the decrease in operating income in was primarily due to the litigation settlement of million and an overall increase in other operating expenses which was offset by increases in gross margin from both license and services and a reduction in stock based compensation expense 
other income expense year ended december  change amount percentage of revenues amount percentage of revenues amount in thousands other income expense interest income interest expense other  net total other income other income expense 
the increase in interest income in the was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents available for investment  short term investments and an increase in the yield on investment 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the pay off of our debt in the quarter ended march  other  net expense increased primarily due to foreign exchange losses compared to foreign exchange gains related to unfavorable exchange rate movements on non us dollar denominated accounts receivable and intercompany balances 
provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes year ended december  change amount percentage of revenues amount percentage of revenues amount in thousands provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in and represents foreign withholding taxes and income taxes payable in both our us operations and in certain foreign locations that cannot be offset through loss carryforwards 
in addition  the tax rate included a benefit from the release of a portion of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the effective tax rate for decreased to an effective tax benefit of compared to an effective tax provision of for the decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily due to a reduction in our valuation allowance of million  which was recognized through reductions to income tax expense of million and to goodwill of million 
these reductions are reflected in the effective tax rate benefit of associated with changes to our valuation allowance 
this benefit was partially offset by a reduction in non deductible stock based compensation expense and to a lesser extent  a reduction in the amount of net operating losses utilized to reduce tax expense 
in utilizing our net operating loss carryforwards  we are required to use our net operating losses in the order they were incurred 
as a result  most of the net operating losses we have used to date reflect those acquired in the clinsoft acquisition 
the utilization of the acquired net operating losses reduces the amount of income taxes payable to local tax authorities 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity were cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaling million and million at december  and december   respectively  and accounts receivable of million and million  respectively 
cash provided by and used in operating activities has historically been affected by changes in working capital accounts  primarily deferred revenues  accounts receivable and accrued expenses  and add backs of non cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense 
fluctuations within accounts receivable and deferred revenues are primarily related to the timing of billings of our term license customers and the associated revenue recognition 
movements in deferred costs are related to the volume and stages of hosted clinical trials and movements in accrued expenses and accounts payable are due to the timing of certain transactions 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in the  which was less than net income of million 
the difference is primarily due to the million litigation settlement payment  the million tax benefit related to exercise of stock options  million in deferred income taxes  increases of million in accounts receivable   in prepaid expenses and other current assets   in deferred rent and  in deferred costs 
these decreases were partially offset by million of depreciation and amortization  million of stock based compensation expense  million of non cash income tax expense   provision for allowance for doubtful accounts and increases of million in deferred revenue  million in accrued expenses and  in accounts payable 
net cash used by investing activities was million during  which was primarily due to the purchase of short term investments of million  capital expenditures associated with the expansion of our hosting facility and purchases of computer equipment to support our work force of million and the payment of the lincoln earn out of million  partially offset by million of proceeds from the maturities of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  consisting primarily of million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sales of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and million from the tax benefit associated with the exercise of options 
at december  and december   we had a million and  respectively  outstanding letter of credit related to our leased facilities 
the letter of credit reduces the amount available under our line of credit with a bank 
substantially all of our long lived assets as december  and december  are located in the united states 
we generally do not enter into long term binding purchase commitments 
our principal commitments consist of obligations under non cancelable operating leases for office space 
the following table of our material contractual obligations as of december  summarizes the aggregate effect that these obligations are expected to have on our cash flows in the periods indicated payments due by period contractual obligations total year or less years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations total prior to august  all borrowings under our million working capital line of credit were secured by substantially all our assets 
under a related negative pledge agreement we were generally prohibited from pledging our intellectual property to others  subject to certain exceptions 
in august  the working capital line of credit was amended to eliminate the security interest in our assets and the negative pledge on our intellectual property 
the amendment also removed or modified the financial covenants 
effective march   the working capital line of credit was reduced from million to million 
as of december  and  there were no amounts outstanding under the working capital line of credit 
at december   there was million available under the line of credit and  reserved under a letter of credit associated with our leased facilities 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
at december   we had million of net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset future us federal taxable income of which approximately million of net operating loss were acquired in the clinsoft acquisition 
these attributes may reduce our future cash tax liability 
approximately million of these net operating losses are subject to a full valuation allowance 
when realization of this deferred tax asset is more likely than not to occur  the benefit will result in a reduction of income tax expense of million and a reduction to goodwill of million 
in addition  we had approximately million of net operating losses resulting from excess tax deductions related to stock based compensation 
we will realize the benefit of these losses through increases to stockholder s equity in the periods in which the losses are utilized to reduce tax payments 
in addition  we had approximately million of federal research and development tax credit carryforwards that may be used to offset future us federal taxable income of which approximately million were acquired in the clinsoft acquisition and have an unlimited carryforward period 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforward period extends through and  respectively  and both are subject to review and possible adjustment by the taxing authorities 
also  the internal revenue code contains provisions that may limit the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards available in any given year in the event of certain changes in the ownership interests of significant stockholders 
in addition  we also had million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset future foreign taxable income 
these foreign net operating loss carryforwards have an unlimited carryforward period 
we currently expect to realize recorded deferred tax assets as of december  of approximately million 
our conclusion that such assets will be recovered is based upon our expectation that our future earnings combined with tax planning strategies available to us will provide sufficient taxable income to realize recorded tax assets 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash provided by operating activities and our debt facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the timing of introductions of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services 
to the extent that existing cash and securities and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
from time to time  we may also enter into agreements with respect to potential investments in  or acquisitions of  businesses  services or technologies  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which is an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
in addition  fin clearly scopes out income taxes from sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will implement this interpretation in the fiscal year starting january  we have completed our preliminary assessment regarding the effect of the implementation of fin and have determined that the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently analyzing the effect  if any  sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in september  the united states securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of each of the company s balance sheet and statement of operations financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
the sab permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying this approach in the first year ending after november  by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
additionally  the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments  other financial instruments sfas no 
 disclosure of fair value of financial instruments  requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments 
financial instruments consist of cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  forward foreign exchange contracts and a line of credit 
the fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying amount 
foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the euro  british pound  australian dollar and japanese yen 
during  and   and  respectively  of our revenues were generated in locations outside the united states 
the majority of these revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  as are many of the associated expenses 
except for revenue transactions in japan  we enter into transactions directly with substantially all of our foreign customers 
this creates a foreign currency exchange risk for us 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of receivables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we also maintain cash accounts denominated in currencies other that the local currency which expose us to foreign exchange rate movements 
in addition  although our foreign subsidiaries have intercompany accounts that eliminate upon consolidation  such accounts expose us to foreign currency rate movements 
exchange rate fluctuations on short term intercompany accounts are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations under other income expense  while exchange rate fluctuations on long term intercompany accounts are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets under accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity  as they are considered part of our net investment and hence do not give rise to gains or losses 
we have implemented a risk management program under which we measure foreign currency exchange risk monthly and manage those exposures through the use of various operating strategies as more fully described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we regularly hedge our non us dollar based exposures by entering into short term forward foreign exchange contracts 
this process is designed to minimize foreign currency translation exposures that could otherwise affect consolidated results of operations 
the terms of these contracts are for periods generally ranging from one to two months 
the short term nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at december  and currently  our largest foreign currency exposure is the british pound  primarily because our european operations have a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses 
relative to foreign currency exposures existing at december  and  a unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments 
this is primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
as of december  and we entered into contracts to hedge approximately million and million  respectively  of receivables  intercompany accounts and cash balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
investments in securities are invested primarily in high quality securities of a short duration and are not materially affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
we have a working capital line of credit which bears interest based upon the prime rate 
at december  and  there were no amounts outstanding under our working capital line of credit
