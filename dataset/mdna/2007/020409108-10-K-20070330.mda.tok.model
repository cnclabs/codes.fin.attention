item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company has two reportable segments  visiting nurse vn and personal care pc 
reportable segments have been identified based upon how management has organized the business by services provided to customers and the criteria in sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
our vn segment provides skilled medical services in patients homes largely to enable recipients to reduce or avoid periods of hospitalization and or nursing home care 
vn medicare revenues are generated on a per episode basis rather than a fee per visit or an hourly basis 
approximately of the vn segment revenues are generated from the medicare program while the balance is generated from medicaid and private insurance programs 
our pc segment services are also provided in patients homes 
these services generally provided by paraprofessional staff such as home health aides are generally of a custodial rather than skilled nature 
pc revenues are typically generated on an hourly basis 
approximately of the pc segment revenues are generated from medicaid and other government programs while the balance is generated from insurance programs and private pay patients 
our view on reimbursement and diversification of risk our company is highly dependent on government reimbursement programs which pay for the majority of the services we provide to our patients 
reimbursement under these programs  primarily medicare and medicaid  is subject to frequent changes as policy makers balance their own needs to meet the health care needs of constituents while also meeting their fiscal objectives 
we believe that an important key to our historical success and to our future success is our ability to adapt our operations to meet changes in reimbursement as they occur 
one important way in which we have achieved this adaptability in the past  and in which we plan to achieve it in the future  is to maintain some level of diversification in our business mix 
the execution of our business plan emphasizes our visiting nurse operations 
our personal care operations will help us maintain a level of diversification of reimbursement risk that we believe is appropriate 
our business plan our future success depends on our ability to execute our business plan 
over the next three to five years we will try to accomplish the following o generate meaningful same store sales growth through the focused provision of high quality services and attending to the needs of our patients  o expand the significance of our visiting nurse  medicare based  home health services by selectively acquiring other quality providers and through the startup of new agencies  and o expand our capital base through both earnings performance and by seeking additional capital investments in our company 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  we select the principle or method that is appropriate in the specific circumstances 
application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements  giving due regard to materiality 
receivables and revenue recognition we recognize revenues when patient services are provided 
our receivables and revenues are stated at amounts estimated by us to be their net realizable values 
the company is paid for its services primarily by federal and state third party reimbursement programs  commercial insurance companies  and patients 
revenues are recorded at established rates in the period during which the services are rendered 
appropriate allowances to give recognition to third party payment arrangements are recorded when the services are rendered 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation 
it is common for issues to arise related to medical coding  particularly with respect to medicare  patient eligibility  particularly related to medicaid  and other reasons unrelated to credit risk  all of which may result in adjustments to recorded revenue amounts 
management continuously evaluates the potential for revenue adjustments and when appropriate provides allowances for losses based upon the best available information 
there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change by material amounts in the near term 
medicare revenue recognition on october   medicare implemented the prospective payment system pps and began paying providers of home health care at fixed  predetermined rates for services and supplies bundled into day episodes of home health care 
an episode of home health care spans a day period  starting with the first day a billable visit is furnished to a medicare beneficiary and ending days later 
if a patient is still in treatment on the th day a new episode begins on the st day regardless of whether a billable visit is rendered on that day and ends days later 
the first day of a consecutive episode  therefore  is not necessarily the new episode s first billable visit 
a base episode payment is established by the medicare program through federal legislation for all episodes of care ended on or after the applicable time periods detailed below base episode period payment october  through september   october  through march   april  through december   january  through december   january  through december   the actual episode payment rates  as presented in the table vary  depending on the home health resource groups hhrgs to which medicare patients are assigned and the per episode payment is typically reduced or increased by such factors as the patient s clinical  functional  and services utilization characteristics 
under pps for medicare reimbursement  we record net revenues based on a reimbursement rate that varies based on the severity of the patient s condition  service needs and other related factors 
we record net revenues as services are rendered to patients over the day episode period 
at the end of each month  a portion of our revenue is estimated for episodes in progress 
medicare reimbursement  on an episodic basis  is subject to adjustment if there are significant changes in the patient s condition during the treatment period or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period 
our revenue recognition under the medicare reimbursement program is based on certain variables including  but not limited  to i changes in the base episode payments established by the medicare program  ii adjustments to the base episode payments for partial episodes and for other factors  such as case mix  geographic wages  low utilization and intervening events  and  iii recoveries of overpayments 
adjustments to revenue result from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
we recognize medicare revenue on an episode by episode basis during the course of each episode over its expected number of visits 
effective january   the medicare standard episode rates increased 
based on current law and regulation  medicare rates will change each january thereafter  based on a statutory formula the intent of which is to cause reimbursement rates to reflect changes in the costs of providing services minus per year

adjustments to revenue result from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
we recognize medicare revenue on an episode by episode basis during the course of that episode over its expected number of visits 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on certain factors  such as payor types  historical collection trends and aging categories 
we calculate our reserve for bad debts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
the percentage applied to the receivable balances in the various aging categories is based on historical collection experience 
insurance programs we bear significant insurance risk under our large deductible workers compensation insurance program and our self insured employee health program 
under our workers compensation insurance program  we bear risk up to  per incident 
we purchase stop loss insurance for our employee health plan that places a specific limit  generally  on our exposure for any individual covered life 
malpractice and general patient liability claims for incidents which may give rise to litigation have been asserted against us by various claimants 
the claims are in various stages of processing and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
we also know of incidents that have occurred through december  that may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we carry insurance coverage for this exposure  however  our deductible per claim increased effective july   from  to  we record estimated liabilities for our insurance programs based on information provided by the third party plan administrators  historical claims experience  the life cycle of claims  expected costs of claims incurred but not paid  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
we monitor our estimated insurance related liabilities on a monthly basis 
as facts change  it may become necessary to make adjustments that could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that our present insurance coverage is adequate 
as part of our on going risk management and cost control efforts  we continually seek alternatives that might provide a different balance of cost and risk  including potentially accepting additional self insurance risk in lieu of higher premium costs 
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived assets as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the impairment analysis requires numerous subjective assumptions and estimates to determine fair value of the respective reporting units as required by sfas no 
as of december   we completed our impairment review and determined that no impairment charge was required 
depending on level of sales  our liquidity and other factors  we may be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 
accounting for income taxes as of december   we have net deferred tax assets of approximately  the net deferred tax asset is composed of approximately  of current deferred tax assets and approximately  of long term deferred tax assets 
we have provided a valuation allowance against certain net deferred tax assets based upon our estimation of realizability of those assets through future taxable income 
this valuation was based in large part on our history of generating operating income or losses in individual tax locales and expectations for the future 
our ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  competitive pressures on revenues and margins and legislation and regulation at all levels of government 
we have considered the above factors in reaching our conclusion that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets net of the valuation allowance as of december  however  there can be no assurances that we will meet our expectations of future taxable income 
during the years ended december   and  based on changes in facts and circumstances  changes occurred in the company s expectations with regard to the generation of future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
accordingly  the state and local tax provision for  and included an increase reduction in recorded valuation allowances of approximately  and  respectively 
seasonality our visiting nurse segment operations located in florida normally experience higher admissions during the march quarter than in the other quarters due to seasonal population fluctuations 
acquisitions over the next three to five years we will actively seek to acquire quality providers of medicare certified home health services like our current visiting nurse segment operations 
we may consider acquisitions of businesses that provide health care services similar to those we currently offer in our personal care segment but we expect most of our acquisition activity to be focused on visiting nurse operations 
factors which may affect future acquisition decisions include the quality and potential profitability of the business under consideration  and our profitability and ability to finance the transaction

liquidity and capital resources revolving credit facility

the company has irrevocable letters of credit  totaling million outstanding in connection with its self insurance programs 
thus  a total of million was available for use at december  the company s revolving credit facility is subject to various financial covenants 
as of december   the company was in compliance with the covenants 
under the most restrictive of its covenants  the company is required to maintain minimum net worth of at least million 
the company believes that this facility will be sufficient to fund its operating needs for at least the next year 
the company will continue to evaluate additional capital  including possible debt and equity investments in the company  to support a more rapid development of the business than would be possible with internal funds

we believe that our cash flow from operations  and borrowing capacity on our bank credit facility will be sufficient to cover operating needs  future capital expenditure requirements and scheduled debt payments of miscellaneous small borrowing arrangements and capitalized leases 
in addition  it is likely that we will pursue growth from acquisitions  partnerships and other ventures that would be funded from excess cash from operations  credit available under the bank credit agreement and other financing arrangements that are normally available in the marketplace 
commitments and contingencies letters of credit 
we have outstanding letters of credit totaling million at december   which benefit our third party insurer administrators for our self insurance programs 
the amount of such insurance program letter of credit is subject to negotiation annually upon renewal and may vary in the future based upon such negotiation  our historical claims experience and expected future claims 
it is reasonable to expect that the amount of the letter of credit will increase in the future  however  we are unable to predict to what degree 
we currently have no obligations related to acquisition agreements 
however  we periodically seek acquisition candidates and may reasonably be expected to enter into acquisitions in the future 
general and professional liability 
malpractice and general patient liability claims for incidents which may give rise to litigation have been asserted against us by various claimants 
the claims are in various stages of processing and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
we also know of incidents that have occurred through december  that may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we carry insurance coverage for this exposure  however our deductible per claim increased effective july   from  to  we record estimated liabilities for our insurance programs based on information provided by the third party plan administrators  historical claims experience  the life cycle of claims  expected costs of claims incurred but not paid  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
we monitor our estimated insurance related liabilities on a monthly basis 
as facts change  it may become necessary to make adjustments that could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
medicaid dependence we have a significant dependence on state medicaid reimbursement programs 
for the year ended december   approximately      and of our revenues were generated from medicaid reimbursement programs in the states of ohio  kentucky  connecticut  massachusetts  florida and alabama  respectively 
approximately of our revenues were derived from state medicaid and other government programs  many of which periodically face significant budget issues 
the financial condition of the medicaid programs in each of the states in which we operate is cyclical and many may be expected from time to time to take actions or evaluate taking actions to control the rate of growth of medicaid expenditures 
among these actions are the following o redefining eligibility standards for medicaid coverage o redefining coverage criteria for home and community based care services o slowing payments to providers by increasing the minimum time in which payments are made o limiting reimbursement rate increases o changing regulations under which providers must operate the actions that might be taken or considered are because the number of medicaid beneficiaries and their related expenditures are growing at a faster rate than the government s revenue 
medicaid is consuming a greater percentage of the budget 
this issue is exacerbated when revenues slow in a slowing economy 
we believe that these financial issues are cyclical in nature rather than indicative of the long term prospect for medicaid funding of health care services 
additionally  we believe our services offer the lowest cost alternative to institutional care and are a part of the solution to the states medicaid financing problems 
it is possible however  that the actions taken by the state medicaid programs in the future could have a significant unfavorable impact on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
health care reform the health care industry has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  extensive and dynamic change 
in addition to economic forces and regulatory influences  continuing political debate is subjecting the health care industry to significant reform 
health care reforms have been enacted as discussed elsewhere in this document 
proposals for additional changes are continuously formulated by departments of the federal government  congress  and state legislatures 
government officials can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methodologies 
changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities  the relative cost of doing business  and the methods and amounts of payments for medical care by both governmental and other payors 
legislative changes to balance the budget and slow the annual rate of growth of expenditures are expected to continue 
such future changes may further impact our reimbursement 
there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
federal and state legislative proposals continue to be introduced that would impose more limitations on payments to providers of health care services such as us 
many states have enacted  or are considering enacting  measures that are designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures 
we cannot predict what additional government regulations may be enacted in the future affecting our business or how existing or future laws and regulations might be interpreted  or whether we will be able to comply with such laws and regulations in our existing or future markets 
refer to the sections on reimbursement changes and risk factors in part i  and the notes to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information 
discontinued operations we follow the guidance in sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and  when appropriate  reclassify operating units closed  sold  or held for sale out of continuing operations and into discontinued operations for all periods presented

ebitda ebitda is defined as income before depreciation and amortization  net interest expense and income taxes 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income  cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities  or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the items excluded from ebitda are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity 
management routinely calculates and communicates ebitda and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance  measure leverage capacity and debt service ability  and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value 
ebitda is also used in measurements of borrowing availability and certain covenants contained in our credit agreement

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments we do not use derivative instruments 
market risk of financial instruments our primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates
