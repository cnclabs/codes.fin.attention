index to financial statements condition and operating performance and to provide a context for the discussion that follows 
the detailed discussion and analysis that follows must be read in its entirety in order to fully understand our financial condition and results of operations 
entegris  inc is a leading provider of materials integrity management products and services that purify  protect and transport the critical materials used in key technology driven industries 
entegris derives most of its revenue from the sale of products and services to the semiconductor and data storage industries 
the company s customers consist primarily of semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor equipment and materials suppliers  and hard disk manufacturers which are served through direct sales efforts  as well as sales and distribution relationships  in north america  asia  europe and the middle east 
effective august  entegris  inc  a minnesota corporation  and mykrolis corporation  a delaware corporation  completed a strategic merger of equals transaction  pursuant to which they were each merged into a new delaware corporation named entegris  inc to carry on the combined businesses 
the transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of mykrolis by entegris 
with the merger with mykrolis corporation  the company added liquid and gas filters  liquid delivery systems  components and consumables used to precisely measure  deliver  control and purify the process liquids  gases and chemicals that are used in the semiconductor manufacturing process to our materials integrity management product offerings 
after the merger with mykrolis  the company offers a diverse product portfolio which includes more than  standard and customized products that we believe provide the most comprehensive offering of materials integrity management products and services to the microelectronics industry 
certain of these products are unit driven and consumable products that rely on the level of semiconductor manufacturing activity to drive growth while others rely on expansion of manufacturing capacity to drive growth 
the company s unit driven and consumable product class includes wafer shippers  disk shipping containers and test assembly and packaging products  membrane based liquid filters and housings  metal based gas filters and resin based gas purifiers  as well as pva roller brushes for use in post cmp cleaning applications 
the company s capital expense driven products include its process carriers that protect the integrity of in process wafers  components  systems and subsystems that use electro mechanical  pressure differential and related technologies  to permit semiconductor and other electronics manufacturers to monitor and control the flow and condition of process liquids used in these manufacturing processes 
on december   the company s board of directors approved a change in fiscal year end from a week or week fiscal year period ending on the last saturday of august to december  effective as of december  as a result  the financial periods presented and discussed in this annual report on form k will be defined as follows i year ended december  representing the twelve months ended december   ii four month transition period ended december  representing the four months ended december   iii year ended august  representing the twelve months ended august   and iv year ended august  representing the twelve months ended august  key operating factors key factors  which management believes have the largest impact on the overall results of operations of entegris  inc include level of sales since a large portion of the company s product costs excepting raw materials  purchased components and direct labor are largely fixed in the short medium term  an increase or decrease in sales affects gross profits and overall profitability significantly 
also  increases or decreases in sales and operating profitability affects certain costs such as incentive compensation  commissions and donations  all of which are highly variable in nature 
variable margin on sales the company s variable margin on sales is determined by selling prices and the cost of manufacturing and raw materials 
this is also affected by a number of factors  which include the company s sale mix  purchase prices of raw material especially resin and purchased components  competition  both domestic and international  direct labor costs  and the efficiency of the company s production operations  among others 

index to financial statements fixed cost structure the company s fixed cost structure is significant 
increases or decreases in sales have a large impact on profitability 
there are a number of large fixed or semi fixed cost components  which include salaries  indirect labor  and benefits  and depreciation and amortization 
it is not possible to vary these costs easily in the short term as volumes fluctuate 
thus changes in sales volumes can affect the usage and productivity of these cost components and can have a large effect on the company s results of operations 
overall summary of financial results for the year ended december  for the year ended december   net sales were million  up million  or  from sales reported for the year ended december  
the increase was principally driven by the benefit of a full year of sales from mykrolis operations  acquired on august   with incremental sales of approximately million 
the sales comparison is adversely affected by approximately million due to the year over year currency fluctuations  principally related to the japanese yen  versus the us dollar 
reflecting the year over year sales increase  the company reported higher gross profit and improved gross margins 
the company s gross margin in was versus a year earlier 
the absence of a million incremental cost of sales charge recorded in associated with the fair market value write up of inventory acquired in the merger with mykrolis accounts for about two thirds of the year over year improvement in the company s selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million in the increase in sg a costs primarily reflects the addition of sg a expenses associated with mykrolis infrastructure offset by lower sg a expenses in related to the completion of merger related integration activities when compared to  as well as the benefit of cost containment measures initiated during the latter half of the company reported income from continuing operations of million for compared to a loss of million for income from continuing operations increased due to the higher sales and gross profit levels  and lower levels of merger related integration expenses 
during  the company generated cash of million from operations as the cash generated by the company s net earnings and non cash charges exceeded the effect of working capital changes increases in accounts receivable and inventory along with decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  compared with million at december  critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  management evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  warranty and sales return obligations  inventories  long lived assets  and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the critical accounting policies affected most significantly by estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
net sales the company s net sales consist of revenue from sales of products net of trade discounts and allowances 
revenue for product sales is recognized upon delivery  when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured  and pricing is fixed or determinable 
in most transactions  the company has no obligations to its customers after the date products are shipped other than 
index to financial statements pursuant to warranty obligations 
in the event that significant post shipment obligations or uncertainties exist such as customer acceptance  revenue recognition is deferred as appropriate until such obligations are fulfilled or the uncertainties are resolved 
accounts receivable related valuation accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts and for sales returns and allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing these valuation accounts 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of the company s results of operations for any period if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
in addition  actual results could be different from the company s current estimates  possibly resulting in increased future charges to earnings 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts for all individual receivables judged to be unlikely for collection 
for all other accounts receivable  the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
specifically  management analyzes the age of receivable balances  historical bad debts write off experience  industry and geographic concentrations of customers  general customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when determining its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
an allowance for sales returns and allowances is established based on historical trends and current trends in product returns 
at december  and december   the company s reserve for sales returns and allowances was million and million  respectively 
inventory valuation the company uses certain estimates and judgments to properly value inventory 
in general  the company s inventories are recorded at the lower of manufacturing cost or market value 
each quarter  the company evaluates its ending inventories for obsolescence and excess quantities 
this evaluation includes analyses of inventory levels  historical write off trends  expected product lives  sales levels by product and projections of future sales demand 
inventories that are considered obsolete are written off or a valuation allowance is recorded to establish a new carrying value for the identified items 
in addition  valuation allowances are established for inventory quantities in excess of forecasted demand 
inventory valuation allowances were million at december  compared to million at december  the company s inventories comprise materials and products subject to technological obsolescence  which are sold in highly competitive industries 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than current analyses  additional inventory write downs or valuation allowances may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
impairment of long lived assets the company routinely considers whether indicators of impairment of its property and equipment assets  particularly its molding equipment  are present 
if such indicators are present  it is determined whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows  appraisals or other methods deemed appropriate 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  the company recognizes an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the assets are less than the assets carrying value 
the fair value of the assets then becomes the assets new carrying value  which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the assets 
the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
the company assesses the impairment of amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review  and potentially an impairment charge  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  
index to financial statements significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the company s overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period changing the company s market capitalization relative to its net book value  income taxes in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposures together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company intends to continue to reinvest its undistributed international earnings in its international operations  therefore  no us tax has been recorded to cover the repatriation of such undistributed earnings 
the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets 
management reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for valuation allowances 
these deferred tax assets are evaluated by considering historical levels of income  estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the company would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets 
the company carried a valuation allowance of million and million against its deferred tax assets at december  and december   respectively  in connection with a portion of a capital loss carryforward related to the company s discontinued operations that more likely than not will not be realized 
the change in the valuation allowance resulted from the resolution of a matter with respect to the characterization of certain gains and losses 
warranty claims accrual the company records a liability for estimated warranty claims 
the amount of the accrual is based on historical claims data by product group and other factors 
claims could be materially different from actual results for a variety of reasons  including a change in product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure  manufacturing changes that could impact product quality  or as yet unrecognized defects in products sold 
at december  and december   the company s accrual for estimated future warranty costs was million and million  respectively 
business acquisitions the company accounts for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact net income 
accordingly  for significant items  the company typically obtains assistance from independent valuation specialists 
there are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
for intangible assets  the company normally utilizes the income method 
this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the projected future cash flows including timing and the discount rate reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flows 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment 
for example  different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 
all of these judgments and estimates can significantly impact net income 

index to financial statements results of operations twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  unaudited the following table sets forth the results of operations and the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  for the years ended december  and december  the company s historical financial data were derived from its consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
dollars in thousands year ended december  year ended december  unaudited of net sales of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses engineering  research and development expenses operating profit loss interest income  net other income  net income loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliates income tax expense benefit equity in net earnings loss of affiliates net income loss from continuing operations net sales for the year ended december   net sales were million  up million  or  from sales reported for the year ended december  
the increase in net sales reflects the inclusion of sales from the former mykrolis operations for the full year in versus only the five month period from august  through december  for the prior period 
such incremental sales totaled million and accounted for approximately of the year over year increase 
net sales for fiscal included unfavorable foreign currency effects  principally related to the japanese yen  versus the us dollar in the amount of million 
on a geographic basis  total sales to north america were  asia pacific  europe and japan in demand drivers for the company s business primarily are comprised of semiconductor fab utilization and production unit driven as well as capital spending for new or upgraded semiconductor fabrication facilities capital driven 
the company analyzes sales of its products by these two key drivers 
sales of unit driven products represented of sales and capital driven products represented of total sales in this compares to a unit driven to capital driven ratio of for the year ended december  sales of unit driven products grew in as semiconductor fab utilization rates remained strong and stable 
unit driven products have average lives of less than months or need to be replaced based on usage levels 
these products include liquid filters used in the photolithography  cmp and wet  etch and clean processes  and in wafer shippers  used to ship raw wafers  particularly at wafer sizes of mm and below  as well as in chip trays and data storage components used to ship mm and mm disk drives 
demand for liquid filters remained relatively stable for most of these semiconductor applications  but sales of these products to non semiconductor customers declined modestly 
sales of wafer shippers increased modestly due to higher sales of mm wafer shipper products 
sales of disk shippers for data storage products were also higher  as the market for mm devices remained strong 

index to financial statements year over year sales of capital driven products generally improved in  reflecting strong sales during the first half of the year and a decline during the second half of reflecting a general slowing of the industry  particularly in north america 
capital driven products include wafer process carriers  gas micro contamination control systems  used in the deployment of advanced photolithography processes  fluid handling systems including dispense pumps used in the photolithography process  and integrated liquid flow controllers used in various processes around the fab 
sales of liquid systems grew during the first half of the year  but declined later in reflecting a general slowing in the industry 
wafer transport products  such as mm foup products  also reflected slower capital spending  particularly at some north american customers 
sales of gas microcontamination control products reached the all time high in  reflecting the market acceptance of the company s gas purification systems and liquid lens system used on advanced lithography steppers 
sequentially  sales for the fourth quarter of were lower than the third quarter of due to lower sales of capital driven products 
unit driven sales remained stable reflecting flat levels of wafer starts and semiconductor production 
this was in contrast to significantly lower sales of capital driven products due in part to softening in demand  particularly from north american customers 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  increased by million to million  an increase of from the million for the comparable period 
the gross margin percentage for was versus for the comparable period 
the gross profit and gross margin improvements for the year ended december  compared to the same period a year ago were mainly due to the addition of the former mykrolis operations  particularly the inclusion of sales of gas micro contamination and liquid micro contamination product lines as these products typically carry higher gross margins than the company s other products 
the company also benefited from improved sales levels resulting in improved utilization of its manufacturing facilities 
prices for raw materials were relatively stable sequentially and compared to the year ago period 
gross profit in was reduced by costs of million incurred in connection with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in the us  germany and japan 
offsetting these charges to gross profit was a gain of million on the sale of a facility recognized during the second quarter of gross profit in the third and fourth quarters of was lower than the strong levels achieved earlier in the year due to manufacturing inefficiencies experienced at a north american plant in the third quarter and expenses incurred in the fourth quarter in connection with a comprehensive worldwide review of the company s manufacturing operations to identify and resolve manufacturing inefficiencies 
gross profit in was significantly affected by the inclusion of million in incremental cost of sales charge associated with the fair market value write up of inventory acquired in the merger with mykrolis 
the inventory write up was recorded as part of the purchase price allocation and was charged to cost of sales over inventory turns of the acquired inventory during the third and fourth quarters of also during  the company incurred costs of million associated with the realignment of manufacturing facilities in the us  germany and japan and its production and administrative activities  including million in accelerated depreciation and impairment charges associated with assets sold or in connection with realignment activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses of million for increased million  or as compared to million in the comparable period a year ago 
sg a expenses  as a percent of net sales  fell to from a year earlier 
the lower sg a costs as a percent of net sales reflects the benefit of cost reductions associated with the merging of the two entities 
the year over year increase in sg a costs reflect the addition of sg a expenses associated with mykrolis infrastructure as well as increased amortization of intangibles of million 
costs of million were 
index to financial statements incurred by the company in connection with the integration and realignment activities associated with the mykrolis merger compared to million in the costs included in the latter category generally relate to expenses incurred to integrate mykrolis operations and systems into the company s pre existing operations and systems 
these costs include  but are not limited to  the integration of information systems  employee benefits and compensation  accounting finance  tax  treasury  risk management  compliance  administrative services  sales and marketing and other functions and includes severance and retention costs 
sg a costs fell during the second half as cost containment measures were put in place in the face of slowing sales and as integration activities were completed 
engineering  research and development expenses engineering  research and development er d expenses rose by million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million for the year ended december  the increases mainly reflect the inclusion of er d expenses associated with former mykrolis operations 
er d expenses as a percent of net sales were compared to a year ago 
the company continues to focus on supporting current product lines  and developing new products and manufacturing technologies 
interest income  net net interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in the year ago period 
the increases reflect the considerably higher rates of interest available on the company s investments in short term debt securities as well as the higher average net invested balance compared to the year ago period  associated in part with the cash and short term investments acquired in the mykrolis merger 
income tax expense the company recorded income tax expense of million in fiscal compared to an income tax benefit of million for the comparable period a year ago 
the effective tax rate was in fiscal compared with a rate a year earlier 
the company s tax rate was lower than statutory rates due to the benefits associated with export activities and a tax holiday in malaysia whereby as a result of employment commitments and capital investments made by the company  income from certain manufacturing activities in malaysia was exempt from tax with tax benefits in in the amount of million 
in  the company benefited from a tax holiday in malaysia whereby as a result of employment and r d expenditure commitments made by the company  income from certain manufacturing activities in malaysia was exempt from tax with tax benefits of million 
discontinued operations the company s businesses classified as discontinued operations recorded nominal losses before income taxes for fiscal the year to date results of income from discontinued operations included a tax benefit of million recorded in the first quarter of related to the change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting from the resolution of a matter with respect to the characterization of certain gains and losses 
net income the company recorded net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in the comparable period 
income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in the year ago period 

index to financial statements four months ended december  compared to four months ended december  unaudited the following table sets forth the results of operations and the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  for the four months ended december  and december  the company s historical financial data were derived from its consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report

sales were adversely affected by approximately million due to the weakening of international currencies versus the us dollar  most notably in japan 
on a geographic basis  total regional sales to north america were  asia pacific  europe and japan 
industry indicators during the period were largely positive 
semiconductor device makers and foundries reported continued high fab utilization rates  both at the advanced technology nodes and for nand flash and other memory devices 
capital spending was also generally favorable 
these trends were reflected across unit driven products 
in particular  sales of liquid filtration and purification products  which represent almost half of unit driven sales  improved over the comparable period a year ago 
strength in japan and north america was offset by relative weakness in europe  whose order trends typically trail those in other geographies 
sales of wafer shippers rose during the period  driven by demand for product for mm and below 
other unit driven products were mixed 
strong sales of gas microcontamination filters and purifiers  which are used on a broad spectrum of gas and vacuum based tools  offset lower sales of shippers for data storage devices and matrix trays for finished electronic products 
among capital driven products  sales of mm wafer carriers improved over the comparable period a year earlier 
sales of these products are primarily driven by the timing of new fab construction  and as such  demand can be variable from period to period 
sales of liquid systems products were also higher than a year ago 
gross profit gross profit in the four months ended december  increased by million to million  an increase of from the million reported in the four months ended december  the gross margin percentage for the four months ended december   was versus in the comparable period of 
index to financial statements the gross margin percentage figure for the four months ended december   was significantly below the figure for the same period in the prior year for a number of reasons 
the main factor was the million incremental cost of sales charge associated with the fair market value write up of inventory acquired in the merger with mykrolis 
the inventory write up was recorded as part of the purchase price allocation and was charged to cost of sales over inventory turns of the acquired inventory and was fully expensed by the end of the quarter ended november  costs of million associated with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in the us  germany and japan also reduced gross profit 
although price increases for resins recently began to moderate  on a year over year basis  the company s gross margin was lower due to higher material costs for certain products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million  or  to million in the four months ended december   up from million in the comparable four month period a year earlier 
due to the magnitude of the increase  sg a expenses  as a percent of net sales  rose to from a year earlier 
the increase in sg a costs reflects the addition of sg a expenses of million associated with mykrolis infrastructure and increased amortization of intangibles of million as well as costs of million incurred by the company in connection with the integration activities associated with the mykrolis merger 
the costs included in this category generally relate to expenses incurred to integrate mykrolis operations and systems into the company s pre existing operations and systems 
these costs include  but are not limited to  the integration of information systems  employee benefits and compensation  accounting finance  tax  treasury  risk management  compliance  administrative services  sales and marketing and other functions and includes severance and retention costs 
the year over year increase also includes incremental share based compensation expense of million 
engineering  research and development expenses engineering  research and development er d expenses were million in the four months ended december   up from million in the four months ended december  er d expenses  as a percent of net sales  increased to from  reflecting the inclusion of mykrolis er d expenses 
the company continued to focus on the support of current product lines  and the development of new products and manufacturing technologies 
interest income  net net interest income of million in the four months ended december  compared to million in the same four month period a year ago 
the increase reflects the higher rates of interest available on the company s investments in short term debt securities as well as the higher average net invested balance compared to the year ago period  associated in part with the investment funds acquired in the mykrolis merger 
income tax expense the company recorded an income tax benefit of million in the four months ended december  compared to income tax expense of million in the four months ended december  the effective tax rate was in the period  compared to in the period 
during in the four months ended december   the company recorded a tax benefit million  plus interest  related to the refund of certain minnesota corporate income taxes previously paid for fiscal years and based upon recent court rulings 
in both periods  the company s effective tax rate benefited from a tax benefit associated with export activities and a tax credit associated with research and development r d activities 
in addition  the company benefited from a tax holiday in malaysia whereby as a result of employment and r d expenditure commitments made by the company  income from certain manufacturing activities in malaysia was exempt from tax with tax benefits in the four months ended december  in the amount of million 
income tax expense in the four months ended december  also included a million tax benefit that was recorded in connection with the resolution of a us federal income tax refund claim made by the company 
discontinued operations the company s businesses classified as discontinued operations recorded a net loss of million  net of tax  in the four months ended december  the results included impairment charges of million  net of tax  associated with write downs of long lived assets to fair value less cost to sell 
these product lines were sold in late calendar and the first quarter of calendar 
index to financial statements net loss income the company recorded a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in the four month period ended december  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the four month period ended december  the loss from continuing operations for the four month period was million  or per share  compared to net income of million  or per share  in the four month period

approximately two thirds of the sales increase for was associated with the mykrolis merger 
the semiconductor market generated about of the company s overall sales for fiscal  compared to about in fiscal exclusive of the mykrolis sales recorded late in fiscal  sales of semiconductor products decreased by from fiscal to both unit driven product lines such as wafer shippers  and test  assembly and packaging products and capital spending driven products  such as wafer and reticle carrier products and fluid handling products saw slight sales declines 
during fiscal  the company s data storage products increased by as customers experienced significant increased demand for a wide range of consumer driven electronic products 
the increase in sales was particularly driven by results in the first three quarters of the fiscal year with sales moderating in the fourth quarter of the fiscal sales of services rose from fiscal the increase reflects growth from a service facility acquired in france in the third quarter of fiscal along with increased sales of equipment used to clean wafer shippers  disk carriers and other shipping products 
during fiscal sales in all geographies increased with the highest increase in the asia pacific region

liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations and capital requirements through cash flow from operating activities  long term loans  lease financing and borrowings under domestic and international short term lines of credit 
in august  the company financed its merger with mykrolis corporation through the issuance of common stock and stock options 
operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million in for the year ended december  cash flow primarily related to non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization of million  and share based compensation expense of million 
offsetting these items was the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities  most notably receivables and inventory increases and a decrease in accounts payable 

index to financial statements net cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million in the four months ended december  the company s net loss from continuing operations of million was offset by various noncash charges  including depreciation and amortization of million  the incremental cost of sales charge of million associated with the write up of inventory and share based compensation expense of million 
operating cash flow was only nominally affected by the impact of changes in working capital accounts 
working capital stood at million at december   including million in cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments of million 
during  accounts receivable  net of foreign currency translation adjustments  increased by million  reflecting the increase in net sales levels 
the company s days sales outstanding stood at days compared to days at the beginning of the year 
inventories rose by million from december  due to a general increase in production activity associated with higher order and sales levels  and increases in inventories at various locations worldwide related to a change in distribution model and in order to improve customer delivery times 
the increase was also due to inventory builds to support the company s manufacturing facility consolidations 
investing activities net cash flow used in investing activities totaled million in the twelve months ended december  acquisition of property and equipment totaled million  primarily for additions of manufacturing equipment  tooling and information systems  and the expansion of the company s kulim  malayisia facility in anticipation of moving the manufacture of certain products to kulim  as well as expanding engineering and applications support capabilities there 
the company currently expects total capital expenditures of approximately million for calendar proceeds of million from the sale of various property and equipment were recorded in the twelve months ended december  during the year ended december   short term investments in the amount of million  net of purchases  matured 
short term investments stood at million at december  net cash used in investing activities totaled million for the four months ended december  acquisition of property and equipment of million  primarily for additions of manufacturing  computer and laboratory equipment 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities totaled million during fiscal the company made payments of million on borrowings 
no proceeds from new borrowings were received during the current year 
the company received proceeds of million in connection with common shares issued under the company s stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
on august  the company s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million over the succeeding to months 
in connection with the share repurchase program the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement asra and a collared accelerated share repurchase agreement casra with goldman  sachs co 
gs on august  under the asra  which was effective as of august   the company acquired  shares of common stock on september  from gs for million 
the transaction was accounted for as a share retirement with common stock  paid in capital and retained earnings reduced by thousand  million  and million  respectively 
under the casra  the company paid million for a prepaid forward contract  which was effective august   to repurchase the company s common stock 
the company received deliveries of common stock of million shares and million shares on september  and october   respectively 
the transaction was accounted for as a share retirement with common stock  paid in capital and retained earnings reduced by thousand  million  and million  respectively 
million of the million payment is reflected as a prepaid forward contract for share repurchase in shareholders equity  which will be credited as the company receives additional shares under the casra 

index to financial statements under both the accelerated share repurchase asra and the collared accelerated share repurchase agreements casra  gs may repurchase an equivalent number of shares in the open market through september  at that date  the company s price under the asra will be adjusted up or down based on the volume weighted average price of the stock during this period 
such adjustment may be settled in cash or stock at the company s discretion 
the company may also receive additional shares pursuant to the casra  depending on movements in the market price of the company s common stock 
the company financed the asra and casra with its available cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash used in financing activities totaled million for the four month transition period ended december  principal payments on short term borrowings and long term debt were million 
proceeds from borrowings of million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million partially offset this cash outflow 
as of december   the company s sources of available funds comprised million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments  as well as funds available under various credit facilities 
entegris has an unsecured revolving credit agreement with one domestic commercial bank with aggregate borrowing capacity of million  with no borrowings outstanding at december  and lines of credit with three international banks that provide for borrowings of currencies for the company s overseas subsidiaries  equivalent to an aggregate of approximately million 
there were no borrowings outstanding on these lines of credit at december  the company s unsecured revolving credit agreement  which expires in may  allows for aggregate borrowings of up to million with interest at eurodollar rates plus 
under the unsecured revolving credit agreement  the company is prohibited from paying cash dividends 
the company is also subject to  and is in compliance with  certain financial covenants including a leverage ratio of funded debt to ebitda as defined therein of not more than to 
in addition  the company must maintain a calculated consolidated tangible net worth  which  as of december   was million  while also maintaining consolidated aggregate amounts of cash and cash equivalents which under the agreement may also include auction rate securities classified as short term investments of not less than million 
at december   the company s shareholders equity stood at  million  up slightly from  million at the beginning of the year 
this change reflects the company s net earnings of million  the proceeds of million received in connection with shares issued under the company s stock option and stock purchase plans  and the increase in additional paid in capital of million associated with the recording of share based compensation expense  offset in part by the million repurchase of the company s common stock 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its working capital and investment requirements for the next months 
however  future growth  including potential acquisitions  may require the company to raise capital through additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that any such financing would be available on commercially acceptable terms 

index to financial statements the following table summarizes the maturities of the company s significant financial obligations maturity by fiscal year in thousands total thereafter contractual obligations related to off balance sheet arrangements operating leases     foreign currency contracts   total      contractual obligations reflected in the balance sheet long term debt  pension obligations  total     quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks entegris principal financial market risks are sensitivities to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s interest bearing cash equivalents and short term investments  and long term debt and short term borrowings are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
most of its long term debt at december  carries fixed rates of interest 
the company s cash equivalents and short term investments are debt instruments with maturities of months or less 
a basis point change in interest rates would potentially increase or decrease annual net income by approximately million annually 
the cash flows and earnings of the company s foreign based operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the company occasionally uses derivative financial instruments to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with its foreign based operations 
at december   the company was party to forward contracts to deliver japanese yen  taiwanese dollars  euros  korean won  malaysia ringgits  and singapore dollars with notional values of approximately million  million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rates would potentially result in exchange gains or losses that would increase or decrease net income by approximately million 
impact of inflation the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis  which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 
material and labor expenses are the company s primary costs 
the cost of certain materials  including polymers and stainless steel  were flat compared to one year ago due to increased production capacity of suppliers and relatively stable oil prices 
entegris expects the cost of these materials to increase in the upcoming fiscal year due to tightening of production capacity of its suppliers and a projected increase in oil prices 
labor costs  including taxes and fringe benefits rose slightly in fiscal and moderate increases also can be reasonably anticipated for fiscal the company s products are sold under contractual arrangements with our large customers and at current market prices to other customers 
consequently  the company can adjust its selling prices  to the extent allowed by competition and contractual arrangements  to reflect cost increases caused by inflation 
however  many of these cost increases may not be recoverable
