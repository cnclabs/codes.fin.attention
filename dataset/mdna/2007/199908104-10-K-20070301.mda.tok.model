chillers for large units typically have the longest delivery time and generally have lead times of up to six months 
the major components of commercial hvac systems are compressors and chillers that are manufactured primarily by york  carrier  trane and lennox 
the major suppliers of building automation control systems are honeywell  johnson controls  siemens  york  automated logic  novar and andover control corporation 
we do not have any significant contracts guaranteeing us a supply of raw materials or components 
we administer a portion of our procurement activities with emcor group  a larger publicly held provider of electrical and mechanical services and facilities management 
this coordination includes contractual arrangements with emcor under which certain emcor employees provide procurement management services to us 
sales and marketing we have a diverse customer base  with no single customer accounting for more than of consolidated revenues 
management and a dedicated sales force are responsible for developing and maintaining successful long term relationships with key customers 
customers generally include building owners and developers and property managers  as well as general contractors  architects and consulting engineers 
we intend to continue our emphasis on developing and maintaining long term relationships with our customers by providing superior  high quality service in a professional manner 
we believe we can continue to leverage the diverse technical and marketing strengths at individual locations to expand the services offered in other local markets 
with respect to multi location service opportunities  we maintain a national sales force in our national accounts group 
employees as of december   we had  employees 
we have collective bargaining agreements covering employees 
we have not experienced and do not expect any significant strikes or work stoppages and believe our relations with employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are good 
recruiting  training and safety our continued success depends  in part  on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified engineers  service technicians  field supervisors and project managers 
we believe our success in retaining qualified employees will be based on the quality of our recruiting  training  compensation  employee benefits programs and opportunities for advancement 
we provide on the job training  technical training  apprenticeship programs  attractive benefit packages and career advancement opportunities within our company 
we have established comprehensive safety programs throughout our operations to ensure that all technicians comply with safety standards we have established and that are established under federal  state and local laws and regulations 
additionally  we have implemented a best practices safety program throughout our operations  which provides employees with incentives to improve safety performance and decrease workplace accidents 
regional safety directors establish safety programs and benchmarking to improve safety within their region 
finally  our employment screening process seeks to determine that prospective employees have requisite skills  sufficient background references and acceptable driving records  if applicable 
our rate of incidents recordable under the standards of the occupational safety and health administration osha per employees per year  also known as the osha recordable rate  was during this level was better than the most recently published osha rate for our industry 
we have improved our osha recordable rate every year since we first began tracking it company wide eight years ago 
risk management  insurance and litigation the primary risks in our operations are bodily injury  property damage and workers compensation injuries 
we retain the risk for worker s compensation  employer s liability  auto liability  general liability and employee group health claims resulting from uninsured deductibles per incident or occurrence 
because we have very large deductibles  the vast majority of our claims are paid by us  so as a practical matter we self insure the great majority of these risks 
losses up to such per incident deductible amounts are estimated and accrued based upon known facts  historical trends and industry averages utilizing the assistance of an actuary to project the extent of these obligations 
we are subject to certain claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business 
we maintain various insurance coverages to minimize financial risk associated with these claims 
we have estimated and provided accruals for probable losses and related legal fees associated with certain of our litigation in our consolidated financial statements 
while we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings  in our opinion and based on reports of counsel  any liability arising from these matters individually and in the aggregate will not have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition  after giving effect to provisions already recorded 
in addition to the matters described above  we are defending a dispute arising out of an alleged delay related to a multi family construction project 
plaintiffs allege actual damages of million plus attorneys fees  punitive damages  and pre judgment interest 
the trial relating to this matter is currently scheduled for the second quarter of we anticipate that contribution from a co defendant and insurance proceeds will  in part  offset any adverse judgment 
management believes the accruals relating to the matter appropriately reflect a probable outcome  however  if we are not successful in this dispute  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we typically warrant labor for the first year after installation on new hvac systems and pass through to the customer manufacturers warranties on equipment 
we generally warrant labor for days after servicing of existing hvac systems 
we do not expect warranty claims to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
competition the hvac industry is highly competitive and consists of thousands of local and regional companies 
we believe that purchasing decisions in the commercial  industrial and institutional markets are based on i competitive price  ii long term customer relationships  iii quality  timeliness and reliability of services provided  iv an organization s perceived stability based on years in business  financial strength  and access to bonding  v range of services provided  and vi scale of operation 
to improve our competitive position we focus on both the consultative design and build installation market and the maintenance  repair and replacement market to promote first the development and then the strengthening of long term customer relationships 
in addition  we believe our ability to provide multi location coverage  access to project financing and specialized technical skills for facilities owners gives us a strategic advantage over smaller competitors who may be unable to provide these services to customers at a competitive price 
we believe that we are larger than most of our competitors  which are generally small  owner operated companies that typically operate in a limited geographic area 
however  there are divisions of larger contracting companies  utilities and hvac equipment manufacturers that provide hvac services in some of the same service lines and geographic areas we serve 
some of these competitors and potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do to finance development opportunities and support their operations 
we believe our smaller competitors generally compete with us based on price and their long term relationships with local customers 
our larger competitors compete with us on those factors but may also provide attractive financing and comprehensive service and product packages 
vehicles we operate a fleet of various owned or leased service trucks  vans and support vehicles 
we believe these vehicles generally are well maintained and sufficient for our current operations 
governmental regulation and environmental matters our operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations  including i licensing requirements applicable to engineering  construction and service technicians  ii building and hvac codes and zoning ordinances  iii regulations relating to consumer protection  including those governing residential service agreements  and iv regulations relating to worker safety and protection of the environment 
we believe we have all required licenses to conduct our operations and are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses 
many state and local regulations governing the hvac services trades require individuals to hold permits and licenses 
in some cases  a required permit or license held by a single individual may be sufficient to authorize specified activities for all of our service technicians who work in the state or county that issued the permit or license 
we seek to ensure that  where possible  we have two employees who hold any such permits or licenses that may be material to our operations in a particular geographic region 
our operations are subject to the federal clean air act  as amended  which governs air emissions and imposes specific requirements on the use and handling of chlorofluorocarbons  or cfcs  and certain other refrigerants 
clean air act regulations require the certification of service technicians involved in the service or repair of equipment containing these refrigerants and also regulate the containment and recycling of these refrigerants 
these requirements have increased our training expenses and expenditures for containment and recycling equipment 
the clean air act is intended ultimately to eliminate the use of cfcs in the united states and to require alternative refrigerants to be used in replacement hvac systems 
we do not believe these regulations involving cfcs will materially affect our business on the whole because  although they require us to incur modest ongoing training costs  our competitors also incur such costs  and the regulations may encourage our customers to update their hvac systems

item a 
company risk factors our business is subject to a variety of risks 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below  which we have not determined to be material  may also impair our business operations 
you should carefully consider the risks described below  together with all the information included in this report 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any risk 
such risk events may cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results  and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
because we bear the risk of cost overruns in most of our contracts  we may experience reduced profits or  in some cases  losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates 
our contract prices are established largely upon estimates and assumptions  which include assumptions about future economic conditions  prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials and other factors outside our control 
if these estimates prove to be inaccurate or circumstances change such as unanticipated technical problems  difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals  changes in local laws or labor conditions  weather delays  fluctuations in cost of raw materials  or our suppliers or subcontractors inability to perform  cost overruns may occur  and we could experience reduced profits or a loss for the project 
additionally  in certain circumstances  we guarantee project completion or the achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels by a scheduled date 
failure to meet schedule or performance requirements could result in additional costs to us 
while we may seek to recover these amounts as claims from the supplier  vendor  subcontractor or other third party responsible for the delay or for providing non conforming products or services  we cannot be certain that we will recover all or any part of these costs in all circumstances 
performance problems for existing and future projects could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by us as well as damaging our reputation within our industry and our customer base 
our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations  which means that amounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits 
we cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or  if realized  will result in profits 
projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time or project cancellations or scope adjustments may occur with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog 
finally  poor project or contract performance could also impact our profits 
the revenue projected from our backlog may not be realized or  if realized  may not result in profits 
we may be adversely impacted by the seasonal and cyclical nature of the markets we serve  and an economic downturn in the industries we serve may result in certain of our customers being unable to pay us on a timely basis  or at all  and lead to a decrease in demand for our services 
the demand for our services is dependent upon the existence of construction projects and service requirements within the industries in which we operate 
any downturn in the commercial  industrial and institutional hvac markets or any other of our markets could adversely impact our performance 
the industries we operate in have been and will continue to be vulnerable to general downturns and are cyclical in nature 
as a result  our results may vary depending upon the demand for projects within the industries we serve 
a significant portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds 
we may be unable to compete for work on certain projects if we are not able to obtain the necessary surety bonds 
in the past we have expanded and we intend to continue to expand the number of total contract dollars that require an underlying bond 
surety market conditions are currently difficult as a result of significant losses incurred by many surety companies 
consequently  less overall bonding capacity is available in the market and terms have become more expensive and restrictive 
we may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future  which could preclude us from being able to bid for certain contracts and successfully contract with certain customers 
additionally  even if we are able to successfully increase bonding capacity to sufficiently bond future work  we may be required to post collateral to secure bonds which would decrease the liquidity that we would have available for other purposes 
if our surety companies were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding  our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other surety companies  increasing business with clients that do not require bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project performance  such as letters of credit or cash 
we may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner  on acceptable terms  or at all 
as such  if we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity  it is likely we would be unable to compete for or work on certain projects 
our use of the percentage of completion method of accounting could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenues or profits 
a material portion of our revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion accounting practices that we use result in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in the proportion that our actual costs bear to our estimated contract costs 
the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues  costs and profitability 
we review our estimates of contract revenues  costs and profitability on an ongoing basis 
prior to contract completion  we may adjust our estimates on one or more occasions as a result of change orders to the original contract  collection disputes with the customer on amounts invoiced or claims against the customer for increased costs incurred by us due to customer induced delays and other factors 
contract losses are recognized in the fiscal period when the loss is determined 
contract profit estimates are also adjusted in the fiscal period in which it is determined that an adjustment is required 
as a result of the requirements of the percentage of completion method of accounting  the possibility exists  for example  that we could have estimated and reported a profit on a contract over several periods and later determined  usually near contract completion  that all or a portion of such previously estimated and reported profits were overstated 
if this occurs  the full aggregate amount of the overstatement will be reported for the period in which such determination is made  thereby eliminating all or a portion of any profits from other contracts that would have otherwise been reported in such period or even resulting in a loss being reported for such period 
on a historical basis  we believe that we have made reasonably reliable estimates of the progress towards completion on our long term contracts 
however  given the uncertainties associated with these types of contracts  it is possible for actual costs to vary from estimates previously made  which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenues and profits 
intense competition in our industry could reduce our market share and our profits 
the markets we serve are highly competitive 
our industry is characterized by many small companies whose activities are geographically concentrated 
we compete on the basis of our technical expertise and experience  financial and operational resources  nationwide presence  industry reputation and our dependability 
while we believe our customers consider a number of these factors in awarding available contracts  a large portion of our work is awarded through a bid process 
consequently  price is often the principal factor in determining which contractor is selected  especially on smaller  less complex projects 
smaller competitors are sometimes able to win bids for these projects based on price alone due to their lower cost and financial return requirements 
intense competition is expected to continue in our industry  presenting us with significant challenges in our ability to maintain strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins 
if we are unable to meet these competitive challenges  we could lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in our profits 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified managers and employees  we will be unable to operate efficiently  which could reduce our profitability 
our business is labor intensive  and many of our operations experience a high rate of employment turnover 
at times of low unemployment rates in the united states  it will be more difficult for us to find qualified personnel at low cost in some geographic areas where we operate 
additionally  our business is managed by a small number of key executive and operational officers 
we may be unable to hire and retain the sufficient skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy 
our labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel 
labor shortages  increased labor costs or the loss of key personnel could result in reduced profitability  which would negatively impact our business 
past and future environmental  safety and health regulations could impose significant additional costs on us that reduce our profits 
hvac systems are subject to various environmental statutes and regulations  including the clean air act and those regulating the production  servicing and disposal of certain ozone depleting refrigerants used in hvac systems 
there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change significantly in the future 
various local  state and federal laws and regulations impose licensing standards on technicians who install and service hvac systems 
our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to substantial fines and potentially the loss of our licenses 
it is impossible to predict the full nature and effect of judicial  legislative or regulatory developments relating to health and safety regulations and environmental protection regulations applicable to our operations 
we are effectively self insured against many potential liabilities  and our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks 
although we maintain insurance policies with respect to our related exposures  these policies are subject to high deductibles  as such  we are effectively self insured for substantially most of our claims 
we actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses for the three major lines of coverage worker s compensation  general liability and auto liability 
the determination of such claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the estimated liability are reviewed and updated quarterly 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to the many relevant factors  the effects of which are often unknown  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents that have occurred but are not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
our accruals are based upon known facts  historical trends both internal trends and industry averages and our reasonable estimate of our future expenses and we believe such accruals to be adequate 
however  our risk management strategies and techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk 
if any of the variety of instruments  processes and strategies we utilize to manage our exposure to various types of risk are not effective  we may incur losses that are not covered by our insurance policies or that exceed our accruals or that exceed our coverage limits 
if we experience delays and or defaults in customer payments  we could be unable to recover all expenditures 
because of the nature of our contracts  at times we commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from the customer in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures on projects as they are incurred 
delays in customer payments may require us to make a working capital investment 
if a customer defaults in making its payments on a project in which we have devoted resources  it could have a material negative effect on our results of operations 
actual and potential claims  lawsuits and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and weaken our financial condition 
we are likely to continue to be named as a defendant in legal proceedings claiming damages from us in connection with the operation of our business 
most of the actions against us arise out of the normal course of our performing services on project sites 
we also are and are likely to continue to be a plaintiff in legal proceedings against customers  in which we seek to recover payment of contractual amounts due to us as well as claims for increased costs incurred by us 
when appropriate we establish provisions against possible certain exposures  and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to ongoing exposure 
if in the future our assumptions and estimates related to such exposures prove to be inadequate or wrong  we could experience a reduction in our profitability and liquidity and a weakening of our financial condition 
in addition  claims  lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 
our recent and future acquisitions may not be successful 
we expect to continue to pursue extremely selective acquisitions of businesses 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate acquisitions or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us  or that such transactions will be successful 
acquisitions may expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 
we also may encounter difficulties integrating acquisitions and successfully managing the growth we expect to experience from these acquisitions 
our common stock  which is listed on the new york stock exchange  has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations are likely to continue in the future  and our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the purchase price paid 
the market price of our common stock may change significantly in response to various factors and events beyond our control 
a variety of events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly  including the following i the risk factors described in this report on form k  ii a shortfall in operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors  iii changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance or the financial performance of our competitors or companies in our industry generally  iv general conditions in our customers industries  v general conditions in the securities markets  vi our announcements of significant contracts  milestones  acquisitions  vii our relationship with other companies  viii our investors view of the sectors and markets in which we operate  and ix additions or departures of key personnel 
some companies that have volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to security class action suits filed against them 
if a suit were to be filed against us  regardless of the outcome  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we do not effectively manage our growth  our existing infrastructure may become strained  and we may be unable to increase revenue growth 
the growth that we have experienced  and in the future may experience  may provide challenges to our organization  requiring us to expand our personnel and our operations 
future growth may strain our infrastructure  operations and other managerial and operating resources 
if our business resources become strained  our earnings may be adversely affected and we may be unable to increase revenue growth 
our earnings have previously been negatively impacted by goodwill impairment charges 
earnings for future periods may be further affected by additional impairment charges 
when we acquire a business  we record an asset called goodwill equal to the excess amount paid for the business  including liabilities assumed  over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of the business acquired 
in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 which requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and that certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
also in  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized  but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment  and intangible assets that have finite useful lives should continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
also provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other non amortized intangible assets for impairment 
sfas no 
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions to allocate goodwill to reporting units and to determine the fair value of reporting unit net assets and liabilities  including  among other things  an assessment of market conditions  projected cash flows  investment rates  cost of capital and growth rates  which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we perform an annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of every fiscal year 
additionally  we perform a goodwill impairment review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
at some future date we may determine that an additional significant impairment has occurred in the value of our unamortized intangible assets or fixed assets  which could require us to write off an additional portion of our assets and could adversely affect our financial condition or our reported results of operations 
failure or circumvention of our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting could seriously harm our business 
we plan to continue to maintain and strengthen internal controls and procedures to enhance the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  and not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure of our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
our charter contains certain anti takeover provisions that may inhibit or delay a change in control 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  one or more series of preferred stock having such preferences  powers and relative  participating  optional and other rights including preferences over the common stock respecting dividends and distributions and voting rights as the board of directors may determine 
the issuance of this blank check preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control by means of a tender offer  merger  proxy contest or otherwise 
additionally  certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law may also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by the board of directors 
failure to successfully comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of on a timely basis could seriously harm our business 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires our management to report on our internal controls over financial reporting and also requires our independent registered public accountants to attest to this report 
although we have historically been able to successfully comply with section  in the future  we may not be successful in complying with section on a timely basis 
the failure to comply with section could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties we lease the real property and buildings from which we operate 
our facilities are located in over twenty four states and puerto rico and consist of offices  shops  maintenance and warehouse facilities 
generally  leases range from three to ten years and are on terms we believe to be commercially reasonable 
a majority of these premises are leased from individuals or entities with whom we have no other business relationship 
in certain instances these leases are with employees who are also the former owners of companies we purchased from through these leases were entered into in connection with the acquisition of the companies these individuals owned 
to the extent we renew these leases or otherwise change them  we enter into such agreements on terms that reflect a fair market valuation for the properties 
leased premises range in size from approximately  square feet to  square feet 
to maximize available capital  we generally intend to continue to lease our properties  but may consider owning properties where we believe ownership would be more economical 
we believe that our facilities are sufficient for our current needs 
we lease our executive and administrative offices in houston  texas 
item legal proceedings we are subject to certain claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business 
we maintain various insurance coverages to minimize financial risk associated with these claims 
we have estimated and provided accruals for probable losses and related legal fees associated with certain of our litigation in our consolidated financial statements 
while we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings  in our opinion and based on reports of counsel  any liability arising from these matters individually and in the aggregate will not have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition  after giving effect to provisions already recorded 
in addition to the matters described above  we are defending a dispute arising out of an alleged delay related to a multi family construction project 
plaintiffs allege actual damages of approximately million plus attorneys fees  punitive damages  and pre judgment interest 
the trial relating to this matter is currently scheduled for the second quarter of we anticipate that contribution from a co defendant and insurance proceeds will  in part  offset any adverse judgment 
management believes that the accruals relating to the matter appropriately reflect a probable outcome  however  if we are not successful in this dispute  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results

introduction and overview we are a national provider of comprehensive hvac installation  maintenance  repair and replacement services within the mechanical services industry 
the services we provide address a very broad need  as air is circulated through almost all commercial  industrial and institutional buildings virtually year round 
we operate primarily in the commercial  industrial and institutional hvac markets and perform most of our services within office buildings  retail centers  apartment complexes  manufacturing plants  and healthcare  education and government facilities 
in addition to standard hvac services  we provide specialized applications such as building automation control systems  fire protection  process cooling  electronic monitoring and process piping 
certain locations also perform related activities such as electrical service and plumbing 
nature and economics of our business approximately of our revenues are earned on a project basis for installation of hvac systems in newly constructed facilities or for replacement of hvac systems in existing facilities 
customers hire us to ensure such systems deliver specified or generally expected heating  cooling  conditioning and circulation of air in a facility 
this entails installing core system equipment such as packaged heating and air conditioning units  or in the case of larger facilities  separate core components such as chillers  boilers  air handlers  and cooling towers 
we also typically install connecting and distribution elements such as piping and ducting 
our responsibilities usually require conforming the systems to pre established engineering drawings and equipment and performance specifications  which we frequently participate in establishing 
our project management responsibilities include staging equipment and materials to project sites  deploying labor to perform the work  and coordinating with other service providers on the project  including any subcontractors we might use to deliver our portion of the work 
when competing for project business  we usually estimate the costs we will incur on a project  then propose a bid to the customer that includes a contract price and other performance and payment terms 
our bid price and terms are intended to cover our estimated costs on the project and provide a profit margin to us commensurate with the value of the installed system to the customer  the risk that project costs or duration will vary from estimate  the schedule on which we will be paid  the opportunities for other work that we might forego by committing capacity to this project  and other costs that we incur more broadly to support our operations but which are not specific to the project 
typically customers will seek bids from competitors for a given project 
while the criteria on which customers select the winning bid vary widely and include factors such as quality  technical expertise  on time performance  post project support and service  and company history and financial strength  we believe that price is the most influential factor for most customers in choosing an hvac installation and service provider 
after a customer accepts our bid  we generally enter into a contract with the customer that specifies what we will deliver on the project  what our related responsibilities are  and how much and when we will be paid 
our overall price for the project is typically set at a fixed amount in the contract  although changes in project specifications or work conditions that result in unexpected additional work are usually subject to additional payment from the customer via what are commonly known as change orders 
project contracts typically provide for periodic billings to the customer as we meet progress milestones or incur cost on the project 
project contracts in our industry also frequently allow for a small portion of progress billings or contract price to be withheld by the customer until after we have completed the work  typically for six months 
amounts withheld under this practice are known as retention or retainage 
labor and overhead costs account for the majority of our cost of service 
accordingly  labor management and utilization have the most impact on our project performance 
given the fixed price nature of much of our project work  if our initial estimate of project costs is wrong or we incur cost overruns that cannot be recovered in change orders  we can experience reduced profits or even significant losses on fixed price project work 
we also perform some project work on a cost plus or a time and materials basis  under which we are paid our costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit margin 
these margins are typically less than fixed price contract margins because there is less risk of unrecoverable cost overruns in cost plus or time and materials work 
as of december   we had  projects in process 
our average project takes three to six months to complete  with an average contract price of approximately  our projects generally require working capital funding of equipment and labor costs 
customer payments on periodic billings generally do not recover these costs until late in the job 
our average project duration together with typical retention terms as discussed above generally allow us to complete the realization of revenue and earnings in cash within one year 
because of the integral nature of hvac and related controls systems to most buildings  we have the legal right in almost all cases to attach liens to buildings or related funding sources when we have not been fully paid for installing systems  except with respect to some government buildings 
the service work that we do  which is discussed further below  usually does not give rise to lien rights 
we also perform larger hvac projects 
as of december   we had four projects in process with a contract price of between and million  eleven projects between million and million  projects between million and million  and projects between million and million 
taken together  projects with contract prices of million or more totaled million of aggregate contract value as of december   or approximately  out of a total contract value for all projects in progress of  million 
generally  projects closer in size to million will be completed in one year or less 
it is unusual for us to work on a project that exceeds two years in length 
in addition to project work  approximately of our revenues represent maintenance and repair service on already installed hvac and controls systems 
this kind of work usually takes from a few hours to a few days to perform 
prices to the customer are usually based on the equipment and materials used in the service as well as technician labor time 
we usually bill the customer for service work when it is complete  typically with payment terms of up to thirty days 
we also provide maintenance and repair service under ongoing contracts 
under these contracts  we are paid regular monthly or quarterly amounts and provide specified service based on customer requirements 
these agreements typically cover periods ranging from one to three years and are cancelable on to days notice 
a relatively small but growing portion of our revenues comes from national and regional account customers 
these customers typically have multiple sites  and contract with us to perform maintenance and repair service 
these contracts may also provide for us to perform new or replacement systems installation 
we operate a national call center to dispatch technicians to sites requiring service 
we perform the majority of this work with our own employees  with the balance being subcontracted to third parties that meet our performance qualifications 
we will also typically use proprietary information systems to maintain information on the customer s sites and equipment  including performance and service records  and related cost data 
these systems track the status of ongoing service and installation work  and may also monitor system performance data 
under these contractual relationships  we usually provide consolidated billing and credit payment terms to the customer 
profile and management of our operations our company was originally formed in through an initial public offering  or ipo  and simultaneous acquisition of companies engaged in our business 
from the time we completed our ipo through december  we acquired hvac and complementary businesses  of which were tuck in operations that were integrated upon acquisition with existing operations 
from through we acquired only one company and shifted our strategy from an emphasis on acquisition based growth to a focus on improving the performance of our existing operations 
during that time  we sold or ceased operations at companies and consolidated another companies into other operations 
during  we sold certain assets and ceased operations at one of our operating companies and consolidated one company into other operations 
today we have operating units 
we manage our operations based on a variety of factors 
financial measures we emphasize include profitability  and use of capital as indicated by cash flow and by other measures of working capital principally involving project cost  billings and receivables 
we also monitor selling  general  administrative and indirect project support expense  backlog  workforce size and mix  growth in revenues and profits  variation of actual project cost from original estimate  and overall financial performance in comparison to budget and updated forecasts 
operational factors we emphasize include project selection  estimating  pricing  management and execution practices  labor utilization  safety  training  and the make up of both existing backlog as well as new business being pursued  in terms of project size  technical application and facility type  end use customers and industries  and location of the work 
most of our operations compete on a local or regional basis 
attracting and retaining effective operating unit managers is an important factor in our business  particularly in view of the relative uniqueness of each market and operation  the importance of relationships with customers and other market participants such as architects and consulting engineers  and the high degree of competition and low barriers to entry in most of our markets 
accordingly  we devote considerable attention to operating unit management quality  stability  and contingency planning  including related considerations of compensation  and non competition protection where applicable 
economic and industry factors as an hvac and building controls services provider  we operate in the broader nonresidential construction services industry and are affected by trends in this sector 
while we do not have operations in all major cities of the us  we believe our national presence is sufficiently large that we experience trends in demand for and pricing of our services that are consistent with trends in the national nonresidential construction sector 
as a result  we monitor the views of major construction sector forecasters along with macroeconomic factors they believe drive the sector  including trends in gross domestic product  interest rates  business investment  employment  demographics  and the general fiscal condition of federal  state and local governments 
although nonresidential construction activity has demonstrated periods of both significant growth and decline  it has grown at a compound annual rate of approximately over the last twenty five years 
spending decisions for building construction  renovation and system replacement are generally made on a project basis  usually with some degree of discretion as to when and if projects proceed 
with larger amounts of capital  time  and discretion involved  spending decisions are affected to a significant degree by uncertainty  particularly concerns about macroeconomic and geopolitical trends 
we have experienced periods of time  such as after the terrorist incidents on september  in the us  and prior to and during the war in iraq that occurred in early  when uncertainty caused a significant slowdown in decisions to proceed with installation and replacement project work 
the company believes that the current economic environment is favorable relative to the activity levels of recent years 
operating environment and management emphasis nonresidential building construction and renovation activity  as reported by the federal government  declined over the three year period of to and has expanded moderately during and  and has been strong during during the decline and through  we responded to market challenges by pursuing work in sectors less affected by this downturn  such as government  educational  and health care facilities  and by establishing marketing initiatives that take advantage of our size and range of expertise 
we also responded to declining gross profits over those years by reducing our selling  general  and administrative expenses  and our indirect project and service overhead costs 
we believe our efforts in these areas partially offset the decline in our profitability over that period 
we have experienced notable improvements in both industry activity as well as our own results from to  as discussed further under results of operations below 
as a result of our sale of certain assets and our continued strong emphasis on cash flow  our debt outstanding is now zero  and we have substantial uncommitted cash balances  as discussed further in liquidity and capital resources below 
on february   we put a new credit facility in place with considerably less restrictive terms than those of our previous facilities 
in addition  we have added a second surety to further support our bonding needs  and we believe our relationships with the surety markets are positive in light of our strong current results and financial position 
we have generated positive free cash flow in each of the last eight calendar years and will continue our emphasis in this area 
we believe that the relative size and strength of our balance sheet and surety support as compared to most companies in our industry represent competitive advantages for us 
as discussed at greater length in results of operations below  we have seen increased activity levels in our industry from to we expect price competition to continue to be strong  as local and regional competitors respond cautiously to changing conditions 
we will continue our efforts to find the more active sectors in our markets  and to increase our regional and national account business 
however  our primary emphasis for will be on internal execution and margin improvement  rather than on revenue growth 
we plan to continue our involvement in multi family work  however  we have decided to focus a portion of our resources away from this work and we expect that as a result  the portion of our work that is multi family will diminish somewhat in the future 
in addition to the work we have done on our underperforming units  we have increased our focus on project qualification  estimating  pricing and management  and on service performance 
this focus includes significant increases in unit level training 
beginning in  there has been substantial cost fluctuation in certain commodities that are used in construction activity  including steel  iron  copper  lumber  and poly vinyl chloride pvc pipe 
we estimate that direct purchase of these commodities  principally steel  iron and copper  comprises between and of our average project cost 
as noted below in results of operations  for some of the project work we have performed in  the actual cost of certain commodities necessary for these projects was significantly greater than the commodity cost estimates we used when we committed to prices for these projects  which typically was done in before commodity cost inflation became apparent 
we experienced most of the negative effect of this unrecovered commodity cost inflation in the second quarter of we began taking steps early in to reduce future commodity cost exposure 
among these steps were early buying of commodities for particular projects  or for general inventory  as well as including escalation and escape provisions in project bids and contracts wherever possible 
since mid  we have experienced minimal unrecovered cost inflation 
however  commodity markets remain unsettled  and while we are taking steps as noted above to minimize unrecoverable commodity cost inflation  these steps cannot guarantee that we will avoid all such exposure 
it is also possible that further increases in or uncertainty about commodity costs will decrease demand for nonresidential construction activity  which could in turn reduce our future revenues 
based on indications of stabilizing industry conditions and on our emphasis on internal execution and margin improvement  we expect that our profitability will improve as compared to our results  although there can be no assurance that we will achieve this outcome 
over the longer term  if industry conditions are stable to improving  we believe we will experience more periods of increased revenues 
in addition  given the size and fragmentation of our industry  we believe it makes sense for us to consider acquisition possibilities 
however  we plan to do so on a selective and opportunistic basis  and expect our growth in will largely be generated internally 
critical accounting policies in response to the commission s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we identified our critical accounting policies based upon the significance of the accounting policy to our overall financial statement presentation  as well as the complexity of the accounting policy and our use of estimates and subjective assessments 
we have concluded that our most critical accounting policy is our revenue recognition policy 
as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  our business has two service functions i installation  which we account for under the percentage of completion method  and ii maintenance  repair and replacement  which we account for as the services are performed  or in the case of replacement  under the percentage of completion method 
in addition  we identified other critical accounting policies related to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  the recording of our self insurance liabilities  valuation of deferred tax assets and the assessment of goodwill impairment 
these accounting policies  as well as others  are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
percentage of completion method of accounting approximately of our revenues were earned on a project basis and recognized through the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method as provided by american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  contract revenue recognizable at any time during the life of a contract is determined by multiplying expected total contract revenue by the percentage of contract costs incurred at any time to total estimated contract costs 
more specifically  as part of the negotiation and bidding process in which we engage in connection with obtaining installation contracts  we estimate our contract costs  which include all direct materials exclusive of rebates  labor and subcontract costs and indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and depreciation costs 
these contract costs are included in our results of operations under the caption cost of services 
then  as we perform under those contracts  we measure such costs incurred  compare them to total estimated costs to complete the contract  and recognize a corresponding proportion of contract revenue 
labor costs are considered to be incurred as the work is performed 
subcontract labor is recognized as the work is performed  but is generally subjected to approval as to milestones or other evidence of completion 
non labor project cost consists of purchased equipment  prefabricated materials and other materials 
purchased equipment on our projects is substantially produced to job specifications and is a value added element to our work 
the costs are considered to be incurred when title is transferred to us  which typically is upon delivery to the worksite 
prefabricated materials  such as ductwork and piping  are generally performed at our shops and recognized as contract costs when fabricated for the unique specifications of the job 
other materials cost are not significant and are generally recorded when delivered to the worksite 
this measurement and comparison process requires updates to the estimate of total costs to complete the contract  and these updates may include subjective assessments 
our contracts typically provide for a schedule of billings or invoices to the customer based on reaching agreed upon milestones or as we incur costs 
the schedules for such billings usually do not precisely match the schedule on which we incur costs 
as a result  contract revenues recognized in the statement of operations can and usually do differ from amounts that can be billed or invoiced to the customer at any point during the contract 
amounts by which cumulative contract revenues recognized on a contract as of a given date exceed cumulative billings to the customer under the contract are reflected as a current asset in our balance sheet under the caption costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
amounts by which cumulative billings to the customer under a contract as of a given date exceed cumulative contract revenues recognized on the contract are reflected as a current liability in our balance sheet under the caption billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
the percentage of completion method of accounting is also affected by changes in job performance  job conditions  and final contract settlements 
these factors may result in revisions to estimated costs and  therefore  revenues 
such revisions are frequently based on further estimates and subjective assessments 
we recognize these revisions in the period in which they are determined 
if such revisions lead us to conclude that we will recognize a loss on a contract  the full amount of the estimated ultimate loss is recognized in the period we reach that conclusion  regardless of the percentage of completion of the contract 
revisions to project costs and conditions can give rise to change orders under which the customer agrees to pay additional contract price 
revisions can also result in claims we might make against the customer to recover project variances that have not been satisfactorily addressed through change orders with the customer 
except in certain circumstances  we do not recognize revenues or margin based on change orders or claims until they have been agreed upon with the customer 
the amount of revenue associated with unapproved change orders and claims is currently immaterial 
variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on our operating results  depending on project size  and the recoverability of the variation via additional customer payments 
accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts we are required to estimate the collectibility of accounts receivable and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for receivable amounts we believe we will not ultimately collect 
this requires us to make certain judgments and estimates involving  among others  the creditworthiness of the customer  our prior collection history with the customer  ongoing relationships with the customer  the aging of past due balances  our lien rights  if any  in the property where we performed the work  and the availability  if any  of payment bonds applicable to our contract 
these estimates are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
accounting for self insurance liabilities we are substantially self insured for worker s compensation  employer s liability  auto liability  general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks 
losses up to deductible amounts are estimated and accrued based upon known facts  historical trends and industry averages 
loss estimates associated with the larger and longer developing risks worker s compensation  auto liability and general liability are reviewed by a third party actuary quarterly 
we believe these accruals are adequate 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  timely reporting of occurrences  ongoing treatment or loss mitigation  general trends in litigation recovery outcomes and the effectiveness of safety and risk management programs 
therefore  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and estimates used for recording the liabilities  adjustments may be required and would be recorded in the period that such experience becomes known 
accounting for deferred tax assets we regularly evaluate valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain 
we perform this evaluation quarterly 
estimations of required valuation allowances include estimates of future taxable income 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the activity underlying these assets becomes deductible 
we consider projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
if actual future taxable income differs from our estimates  we may not realize deferred tax assets to the extent we have estimated 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in most businesses we have acquired  the value we paid to buy the business was greater than the value of specifically identifiable net assets in the business 
under generally accepted accounting principles  this excess is termed goodwill and is recognized as an asset at the time the business is acquired 
it is generally expected that future net earnings from an acquired business will exceed the goodwill asset recognized at the time the business is bought 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets requires us to assess our goodwill asset amounts for impairment each year  and more frequently if circumstances suggest an impairment may have occurred 
impairment must be reflected when the value of a given business unit in excess of its tangible net assets falls below the goodwill asset balance carried for that unit on our books 
if other business units have had increases in the value of their respective goodwill balances  such increases may not be recorded under sfas no 
accordingly  such increases may not be netted against impairments at other business units 
the requirements for assessing whether goodwill assets have been impaired involve market based information 
this information  and its use in assessing goodwill  entails some degree of subjective assessment 
we currently perform our annual impairment testing as of october and any impairment charges resulting from this process are reported in the fourth quarter 
we segregated our operations into reporting units based on the degree of operating and financial independence of each unit and our related management of them 
these reporting units are tested for impairment by comparing the unit s fair value to its carrying value 
the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow model combined with market valuation approaches 
significant estimates and assumptions are used in assessing the fair value of reporting units 
these estimates and assumptions involved future cash flows  growth rates  discount rates  weighted average cost of capital and estimates of market valuations for each of the reporting units 
we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million and million in operating results during the fourth quarters of and  respectively 
we recorded an additional impairment charge of million in related to operations that were subsequently discontinued in this impairment charge is reflected in operating loss associated with discontinued operations 
the impairment charge during from continuing operations of million related to a reporting unit in northern michigan and was a result of concerns about the activity levels in this market 
during  we experienced modest revenue growth and improved profitability due to increased industry activity and favorable market conditions 
however  the revenue  operating profits and cash flows for certain reporting units were lower than expected despite these favorable market conditions 
primarily based upon this trend  the revenue  earnings and cash flow projections for certain reporting units were revised downward for the next several years as compared to previous projections 
as a result  an impairment charge of million was recognized in for these reporting units including operations in san diego  houston  grand rapids  central iowa  birmingham  buffalo and albany 
we did not have a goodwill impairment charge in results of operations in thousands table historical results year ended december  revenues cost of services gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses goodwill impairment gain on sale of assets operating income interest income expense  net other income expense write off of debt costs income loss before income taxes income tax expense income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations operating loss  net of tax estimated gain on disposition  including tax net income loss table supplemental non gaap disclosure operating results of ongoing operations excluding certain items the following table presents information excluding write off of debt costs and goodwill impairment charges 
we have included this table because we believe it offers an additional view of the core results of our continuing operations in a way we find useful in managing these operations  and in a way which also responds to frequent questions we receive about the company from third parties 
however  this presentation of operating results is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be considered an alternative to income as determined under generally accepted accounting principles and presented above in table historical results 
in particular  impairment charges under the goodwill accounting rules are generally expected to occur periodically as goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition of businesses responds over time to changes in those businesses markets and operations 
we recorded goodwill impairment charges in and income loss from continuing operations after tax goodwill impairment after tax write off of debt costs after tax income from continuing operations after tax  excluding goodwill impairment and the write off of debt costs diluted earnings per share income from continuing operations after tax  excluding goodwill impairment and the write off of debt costs compared to revenues revenues increased million  or to  million in compared to the revenue growth stemmed primarily from generally improving nonresidential facilities markets throughout the united states especially in markets such as the multi family sector approximately million  office buildings approximately million and schools approximately million 
we have seen increased activity  primarily in our texas  california  tennessee and maryland operations  resulting from the start up of several large projects 
backlog reflects revenues still to be recognized under contracted or committed installation and replacement project work 
project work generally lasts less than one year 
service agreement revenues and service work and short duration projects which are generally billed as performed do not flow through backlog 
accordingly  backlog represents only a portion of our revenues for any given future period  and it represents revenues that are likely to be reflected in our operating results over the next six to twelve months 
as a result  we believe the predictive value of backlog information is limited to indications of general revenue direction over the near term  and should not be interpreted as indicative of ongoing revenue performance over several quarters 
backlog associated with continuing operations as of december  was million  a decrease from september  backlog of million  and a decrease from december  backlog of million 
the sequential and year over year decrease is primarily from one of our larger multi family operations working through its larger than usual existing backlog 
we plan to continue our involvement in multi family work  however  we have decided to focus a portion of our resources away from this work and we expect that as a result  the portion of our work that is multi family will diminish somewhat in the future 
following the three year period of industry activity declines from noted previously  we saw modest year over year revenue increases at our ongoing operations beginning in mid and continuing throughout we continue to see signs that activity levels in our industry will remain strong throughout these observations are based on nonresidential construction spending trends  shipment data from hvac equipment manufacturers  forecasts from construction industry analysts  and anecdotal indications of project consideration 
along with the indications noted above that suggest industry activity is improving  there remain the following cautionary factors in the industry environment  each of which is discussed at greater length in the introduction above 
since hvac and related installation and replacement decisions are capital decisions usually involving some amount of discretion  they tend to be affected to a greater degree by macroeconomic or geopolitical uncertainty 
negative developments or events in these arenas  should they occur  will likely cause end users to defer hvac and related spending decisions  thereby reducing our revenues 
we continue to experience a noticeable amount of price competition in our markets  which restrains our ability to increase revenues 
while we believe we will see continued strength in industry activity levels throughout  in view of all of the foregoing factors  we may experience modest revenue growth or revenue declines in upcoming periods 
in addition  if general economic activity in the us slows significantly from current levels  we may realize decreases in revenue and lower operating margins 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  historical gross profit for was  down from in the decrease in gross profit percentage resulted primarily from an increased proportion of new construction work due to stronger activity  and by job underperformance at our connecticut operations approximately million  and at our large multi family operation based in texas approximately million 
these decreases were partially offset by improved profitability at our southern california operation approximately million 
in addition  we realized higher risk management expense in million primarily due to general liability claims associated with our work in the multi family market 
as noted in the introduction above  we are currently placing a greater emphasis on internal execution and margin improvement than on revenue growth 
this includes a strong focus on those of our units that have underperformed  along with increased training efforts on project qualification  estimating  pricing and management  and on service performance 
while we believe these efforts will help us increase gross profits  we cannot assure that this will occur 
further  if we are successful in these efforts  we cannot assure that they will offset adverse industry trends  if such trends occur 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a increased million  or for as compared to this is primarily due to an increase in the number of overhead personnel to manage internal growth 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a declined from in to in this decrease is consistent with our effort to control our sg a expenses as we experience internal revenue growth 
goodwill impairment we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million during the fourth quarter of and recorded no goodwill impairment charge in during  we experienced modest revenue growth and improved profitability due to increased industry activity and favorable market conditions 
however  the revenue  operating profits and cash flows for certain reporting units were lower than expected despite these favorable market conditions 
primarily based upon this trend  the revenue  earnings and cash flow projections for certain reporting units were revised downward for the next several years as compared to previous projections 
as a result  an impairment charge of million was recognized in for these reporting units including operations in san diego  houston  grand rapids  central iowa  birmingham  buffalo and albany 
impairment must be reflected when the value of a given business unit in excess of its tangible net assets falls below the goodwill asset balance carried for that unit on the company s books 
if other business units have had increases in the value of their respective goodwill balances  such increases may not be recorded under sfas no 
accordingly  such increases may not be netted against impairments at other business units 
interest income expense  net interest expense  net was million in and interest income  net was million in the decrease in interest expense  net is a result of payments on the term loan throughout thereby having no debt outstanding in  and the increase in interest income is due to interest income earned from higher cash balances in the current year 
see liquidity and capital resources for a detail of the components of interest income expense  net for and write off of debt costs the second quarter of includes a non cash write off of million of deferred financing costs resulting from the replacement of our previous credit facility 
income tax expense our effective tax rate associated with results from continuing operations for was 
excluding effects of the goodwill impairment charge  our effective tax rate was 
our effective tax rate is generally higher than statutory rates because of the effect of certain expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes 
in addition  adjustments to tax reserves are analyzed and adjusted quarterly as events occur to warrant such changes 
adjustments to tax reserves are a component of the effective tax rate 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an improvement in operating results which dilutes the impact of non deductible expenses and adjustments to our tax reserves 
furthermore  our state tax rate is lower due to the change in where our income is being earned 
during  the american jobs creation act of was signed into law 
the primary effect of this legislation was to permit us to claim a deduction for of earnings related to certain of our construction related activities beginning in this deduction modestly decreased our effective tax rate 
we currently estimate that our effective tax rate for will be between and 
discontinued operations sale of assets to mesa energy systems  inc on june   we  along with our wholly owned subsidiary  arc comfort systems usa  inc arc  entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell certain assets of arc to mesa energy systems  inc a subsidiary of emcor group  inc for approximately million in cash

individual sales of operating companies in  we also sold two small operating companies in separate transactions and shutdown the operations at another small operating company 
the after tax loss of these companies was million in  and has been reported in discontinued operations under operating loss  net of income tax benefit 
the gain recognized on the sale of these units was million  including tax expense  and was reported in discontinued operations under estimated gain on disposition  including income taxes 
outlook as noted earlier in this review  while we see signs that industry activity levels are continuing to increase in  our primary emphasis for this year is on margin improvement rather than revenue growth 
our ongoing margin efforts include a focus on improving the results of units that incurred losses or subpar income in  and on intensified project and service performance training at the unit level 
based on these margin improvement efforts and developments  on our increased level of backlog as compared to recent periods  and on our belief that industry and economic conditions will remain strong  we expect that our full year profitability will improve as compared to our results 
compared to revenues revenues increased million  or  to million in compared to approximately of the increase in revenues related to internal growth and the remaining resulted from the acquisition of granite state plumbing heating granite in january the internal revenue growth stemmed primarily from generally improving nonresidential facilities markets throughout the united states especially in the institutional markets such as schools and hospitals approximately million  hotels approximately million  and in the multi family sector approximately million 
we have seen increased activity  primarily in our alabama  arizona  florida and wisconsin operations  resulting from the start up of several large projects 
these gains were offset to a lesser degree by lower revenues relating to our operations in southern california that were impacted by continued project delays resulting from extended inclement weather in the first quarter of backlog associated with continuing operations as of december  was million including million from the acquisition of granite  a increase from september  backlog of million  and a increase from december  backlog of million 
these gains result primarily from significant new multi family projects in alabama  as well as office building projects in the washington  dc area 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  historical gross profit for was  up from in the increase in gross profit percentage resulted primarily from increased profitability in our arizona operations approximately million  higher margin storm related project repair work performed by our operation in central florida approximately million and improved margins at an operation in wisconsin which was negatively impacted by increases in the prices for certain commodity materials in approximately million 
these gains were partially offset by job underperformance at one of our larger operations approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a increased million  or for as compared to as a percentage of revenues  sg a declined from in to in this decrease is consistent with our effort to control our sg a expenses as we experience internal revenue growth  partially offset by an increase resulting from higher medical costs approximately million in due to medical inflation in and favorable claims experience in goodwill impairment we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million and million during the fourth quarters of and  respectively 
the impairment charge during from continuing operations of million related to a reporting unit in northern michigan and was a result of concerns about the activity levels in this market that resulted in lower cash flow forecasts for the next several years 
during  we experienced modest revenue growth and improved profitability due to increased industry activity and favorable market conditions 
however  the revenue  operating profits and cash flows for certain reporting units were lower than expected despite these favorable market conditions 
primarily based upon this trend  the revenue  earnings and cash flow projections for certain reporting units were revised downward for the next several years as compared to previous projections 
as a result  an impairment charge of million was recognized in for these reporting units including operations in san diego  houston  grand rapids  central iowa  birmingham  buffalo and albany 
impairment must be reflected when the value of a given business unit in excess of its tangible net assets falls below the goodwill asset balance carried for that unit on the company s books 
if other business units have had increases in the value of their respective goodwill balances  such increases may not be recorded under sfas no 
accordingly  such increases may not be netted against impairments at other business units

other income expense other expense was million for and other income was million for other expense for includes losses of million resulting from mark to market adjustments on a warrant with a third party to buy shares of our stock 
the warrant also carried a put obligation 
this warrant was exercised in october this exercise also terminated the related put obligation 
as a result  there were no further mark to market adjustments to income associated with them 
income tax expense our effective tax rate associated with results from continuing operations for was 
excluding effects of the goodwill impairment charges  our effective tax rate was as compared to in our rate is lower than usual due to an increase in the fourth quarter of in our estimate of the amount of future state taxable income we will have against which we can apply state tax loss carryforwards 
this change in estimate resulted in a reduction in our allowance against state level deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rate is generally higher than statutory rates because of the effect of certain expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes 
in addition  adjustments to tax reserves are analyzed and adjusted quarterly as events occur to warrant such changes 
adjustments to tax reserves are a component of the effective tax rate 
during  the american jobs creation act of was signed into law 
the primary effect of this legislation was to permit us to claim a deduction for of earnings related to certain of our construction related activities beginning in this deduction moderately decreased our effective tax rate

liquidity and capital resources year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities free cash flow cash provided by operating activities taxes paid related to the sale of businesses purchases of property and equipment proceeds from sales of property and equipment free cash flow cash flow we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities excluding items related to sales of businesses  less customary capital expenditures  plus the proceeds from asset sales 
positive free cash flow represents funds available to invest in significant operating initiatives  to acquire other companies  or to reduce a company s outstanding debt or equity 
if free cash flow is negative  additional debt or equity is generally required to fund the outflow of cash 
free cash flow may be defined differently by other companies 
our business does not require significant amounts of investment in long term fixed assets 
the substantial majority of the capital used in our business is working capital that funds our costs of labor and installed equipment deployed in project work until our customers pay us 
customary terms in our industry allow customers to withhold a small portion of the contract price until after we have completed the work  typically for six months 
amounts withheld under this practice are known as retention or retainage 
our average project duration together with typical retention terms generally allow us to complete the realization of revenue and earnings in cash within one year 
accordingly  we believe free cash flow  by encompassing both profit margins and the use of working capital over our approximately one year working capital cycle  is an effective measure of operating effectiveness and efficiency 
we have included free cash flow information here for this reason  and because we are often asked about it by third parties evaluating the company 
however  free cash flow is not considered under generally accepted accounting principles to be a primary measure of an entity s financial results  and accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to operating income  net income  or amounts shown in our consolidated statements of cash flows as determined under generally accepted accounting principles 
for the year ended december   we had free cash flow of million as compared to million in this decrease primarily resulted from an investment in working capital due to higher activity levels 
during  we collected approximately million  primarily related to the sale of two operations to automated logic corporation and automated logic contracting services  inc of million and million related to the sale of arc to mesa energy systems  inc for the year ended december   we had free cash flow of million as compared to million in this increase resulted primarily from increased profitability  net of a slight increase in capital expenditures 
credit facility in june  we entered into a million senior credit facility the facility which is available for borrowings and letters of credit 
the facility is secured by substantially all of our assets except for assets related to projects subject to surety bonds 
as of december   the total of the facility was million  with no outstanding borrowings  million in letters of credit outstanding  and million of credit available 
on february   we amended the facility the amended facility 
the amended facility consists of a million revolving credit facility which is available for borrowings and letters of credit 
the amended facility will expire in february we have a choice of two interest rate options for borrowings under the amended facility  these rates are floating rates determined by the broad financial markets  meaning they can and do move up and down from time to time 
excluding the amortization of debt financing and arrangement costs  we estimate that the interest rate applicable to the borrowings under the amended facility would be approximately as of december  the company incurred certain financing and professional costs in connection with the arrangement of the facility and the related amendment 
these costs will be amortized as a non cash charge to interest expense over the term of the amended facility 
commitment fees are payable on the portion of the capacity not in use for borrowings or letters of credit at any given time 
these fees range from per annum  based on the ratio of debt to credit facility adjusted ebitda 
interest expense for  and included the following primary elements in thousands interest expense on borrowings  and unused commitment fees letter of credit fees amortization of deferred debt arrangement costs and discount total when a previous credit facility was replaced in  a corresponding amount of deferred debt arrangement costs were written off 
this charge of million is reported as write off of debt costs in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  covenant compliance is assessed as of each quarter end 
credit facility adjusted ebitda is defined under the facility for financial covenant purposes as net earnings for the four quarters ending as of any given quarterly covenant compliance measurement date  plus the corresponding amounts for a interest expense  b income taxes  c depreciation and amortization  and d other non cash charges 
the following is a reconciliation of credit facility adjusted ebitda to net income in thousands net income income taxes continuing operations and discontinued operations interest income  net depreciation and amortization expense credit facility adjusted ebitda under the amended facility  only two financial covenants remain 
leverage ratio the amended facility requires that the ratio of the company s total indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents to its credit facility adjusted ebitda not exceed 
fixed charge coverage ratio the amended facility requires that the ratio of credit facility adjusted ebitda  less non financed capital expenditures  tax provision  dividends and amounts used to repurchase stock to the sum of interest expense and scheduled principal payments be at least 
capital expenditures  tax provision  dividends and stock repurchase payments are defined under the facility for purposes of this covenant to be amounts for the four quarters ending as of any given quarterly covenant compliance measurement date 
the calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio was redefined to exclude acquisitions  stock repurchases and the payment of cash dividends  provided that the leverage ratio does not exceed other restrictions the amended facility permits acquisitions of up to million per transaction  or million in the aggregate 
however  these limitations only apply when the leverage ratio is greater than off balance sheet arrangements and other commitments as is common in our industry  we have entered into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets 
our most significant off balance sheet transactions include liabilities associated with noncancelable operating leases 
we also have other off balance sheet obligations involving letters of credit and surety guarantees 
we enter into noncancelable operating leases for many of our facility  vehicle and equipment needs 
these leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of facilities  vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them 
at the end of the lease  we have no further obligation to the lessor 
if we decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term  we would typically owe the lessor the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease 
certain of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf  such as to beneficiaries under our self funded insurance programs 
we have also occasionally used letters of credit to guarantee performance under our contracts and to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts 
the letters of credit we provide are actually issued by our lenders through the facility as described above 
a letter of credit commits the lenders to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified actions 
if this were to occur  we would be required to reimburse the lenders 
depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement  we may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement 
absent a claim  there is no payment or reserving of funds by us in connection with a letter of credit 
however  because a claim on a letter of credit would require immediate reimbursement by us to our lenders  letters of credit are treated as a use of the facility s capacity just the same as actual borrowings 
claims against letters of credit are rare in our industry 
to date we have not had a claim made against a letter of credit that resulted in payments by a lender or by us 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund claims under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future 
many customers  particularly in connection with new construction  require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety 
if we fail to perform under the terms of a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors who provided goods or services under a contract  the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond 
we must reimburse the sureties for any expenses or outlays they incur 
to date  we are not aware of any losses to our sureties in connection with bonds the sureties have posted on our behalf  and we do not expect such losses to be incurred in the foreseeable future 
surety market conditions are currently challenging as a result of significant losses incurred by many sureties in recent periods  both in the construction industry as well as in certain larger corporate bankruptcies 
as a result  less bonding capacity is available in the market and terms have become more restrictive 
further  under standard terms in the surety market  sureties issue bonds on a project by project basis  and can decline to issue bonds at any time 
historically  approximately of our business has required bonds 
while we have enjoyed a longstanding relationship with our primary surety and we have added another surety to further support our bonding needs  current market conditions as well as changes in our sureties assessment of our operating and financial risk could cause our sureties to decline to issue bonds for our work 
if that were to occur  our alternatives include doing more business that does not require bonds  posting other forms of collateral for project performance such as letters of credit or cash  and seeking bonding capacity from other sureties 
we would likely also encounter concerns from customers  suppliers and other market participants as to our creditworthiness 
while we believe our general operating and financial characteristics  including a significant amount of cash on our balance sheet  would enable us to ultimately respond effectively to an interruption in the availability of bonding capacity  such an interruption would likely cause our revenues and profits to decline in the near term 
the following recaps the future maturities of our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands twelve months ended december  thereafter total operating lease obligations absent any significant commitments of capital for items such as capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends and share repurchases  it is reasonable to expect the company to continue to maintain excess cash on its balance sheet 
therefore  we assumed that the company would continue its current status of not utilizing any borrowings under its revolving loan 
as of december  we also have million letter of credit commitments  of which million expire in and million expire in the substantial majority of these letters of credit are posted with insurers who disburse funds on our behalf in connection with our worker s compensation  auto liability and general liability insurance program 
these letters of credit provide additional security to the insurers that sufficient financial resources will be available to fund claims on our behalf  many of which develop over long periods of time  should we ever encounter financial duress 
posting of letters of credit for this purpose is a common practice for entities that manage their self insurance programs through third party insurers as we do 
while most of these letter of credit commitments expire in  we expect nearly all of them  particularly those supporting our insurance programs  will be renewed annually 
other than the operating lease obligations noted above  we have no significant purchase or operating commitments outside of commitments to deliver equipment and provide labor in the ordinary course of performing project work 
outlook we have generated positive net free cash flow for the last eight calendar years  most of which occurred during challenging economic and industry conditions 
we also expect to have no debt  significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility  and substantial uncommitted cash balances 
we believe these factors will provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
seasonality and cyclicality the hvac industry is subject to seasonal variations 
specifically  the demand for new installation and replacement is generally lower during the winter months the first quarter of the year due to reduced construction activity during inclement weather and less use of air conditioning during the colder months 
demand for hvac services is generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters due to increased construction activity and increased use of air conditioning during the warmer months 
accordingly  we expect our revenues and operating results generally will be lower in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
historically  the construction industry has been highly cyclical 
as a result  our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in new installation and replacement projects in various geographic regions of the united states 
new accounting pronouncements we have various stock based compensation plans 
prior to january   we accounted for those plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
no stock based employee compensation cost was recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  or  except with respect to the amortization of the intrinsic value of restricted stock grants totaling million and million  respectively 
options granted under our equity compensation plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and all terms were fixed  accordingly  no expense was recognized under apb opinion no 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment statement r  using the modified prospective transition method 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
the adoption of statement r resulted in compensation expense of million million after tax or per basic share and per diluted share for the year ended december  prior to adopting statement r  we presented the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs excess tax benefits as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
statement r requires these excess tax benefits to be reported as financing cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin is an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes 
in addition  fin requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes 
fin will be effective for us beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that fin will have on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates as discussed below 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continues to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we are not exposed to any other significant financial market risks including commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risks from the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments 
we have limited exposure to changes in interest rates due to our lack of indebtedness for borrowed money 
we have a debt facility under which we may borrow funds in the future 
we do not currently foresee any borrowing needs
