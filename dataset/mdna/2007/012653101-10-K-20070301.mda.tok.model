item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page recent acquisitions and joint ventures over the last three years  we have devoted a significant amount of resources to acquisitions  including the subsequent integration of acquired businesses  and to joint ventures 
these acquisitions and joint ventures have expanded our base business  provided our customers with a wider array of products and presented new alternatives for discovery through additional chemistries 
the following is a summary of our acquisitions and joint ventures during the last three years on september   we acquired the assets and fine chemistry services and pharmaceuticals business associated with the south haven  michigan facility of dsm pharmaceutical products dsm  a business group of royal dsm nv  for approximately million subject to final post closing adjustments 
on july   we completed the acquisition of the akzo nobel refinery catalysts business for approximately million  including expenses  at applicable exchange rates 
during and  we increased the purchase price by approximately million and million  respectively  due primarily to payments to akzo nobel as part of the post closing working capital adjustments 
during  refinements were made in the determination of the final purchase price allocation versus the estimated allocation at december  however  none of the changes made to the december  allocation were material to our financial position or results of operations 
as part of the acquisition  we acquired ownership of non consolidated joint ventures in brazil f brica carioca de catalisadores sa  japan nippon ketjen co  ltd  and france eurecat sa with affiliates in the united states  saudi arabia and italy 
effective january   we acquired the business assets  customer lists and other intangibles of taerim international corporation for approximately million and formed albemarle korea corporation  which is located in seoul  south korea 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries employees as of december   we had  employees of whom  or  are employed in the united states   or  are employed in europe  and  or  are employed in asia 
approximately of our us employees are unionized 
we have bargaining agreements at three of our us locations baton rouge  louisiana united steel workers usw  orangeburg  south carolina international brotherhood of teamsters industrial trades division  and pasadena  texas united steel workers usw  sheet metal workers international association  united association of journeymen apprentices of plumbing and pipefitting industry  and international brotherhood of electrical workers 
we believe that we have good working relationships with these unions  and we have operated without a labor work stoppage at each of these locations for more than years 
two of our bargaining agreements expire in and one expires in we have three works councils representing the majority of our european sites amsterdam and amersfoort  the netherlands  port de bouc  france  and bergheim  germany covering approximately  employees 
in addition  we have approximately employees at our manufacturing facility in avonmouth  united kingdom that are represented by unions through a current collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our relationship with these councils and bargaining representatives is generally good

risk factors 
you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information  including the financial information  contained in this annual report on form k 
our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy  on a timely basis or at all  could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products 
our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly 
increases are primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil  chlorine and metals  including molybdenum  which is used in the refinery catalysts business 
we generally attempt to pass changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers  but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so 
our inability to pass through price increases or any limitation or delay in our passing through price increases could adversely affect our margins 
in addition to raising prices  raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies 
constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt production and adversely affect the performance of our business 
we face competition from other specialty chemical companies  which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products 
we operate in a highly competitive marketplace  competing against a number of domestic and foreign specialty chemical producers 
competition is based on several key criteria  including product performance and quality  product price  product availability and security of supply  responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service 
some of our 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources 
these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry  changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions 
additionally  competitors pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices  which could affect our margins and profitability adversely 
our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is  and will continue to be  dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume  shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development 
if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position  we could lose market share to our competitors 
downturns in our customers cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales 
many of our customers are in industries  including the electronics  building and construction  and automotive industries  that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions 
historically  downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices  and we may experience similar problems in the future 
a decline in economic conditions in our customers cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 
our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products 
the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use  requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced  on average  once every one to three years 
the sales of our hpc catalysts  therefore  are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter 
in addition  the timing and profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter 
sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions  which may prevent farming for extended periods 
changes in our customers products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals 
our specialty chemicals are used for a broad range of applications by our customers 
changes in our customers products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary 
customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products 
for example  many of our flame retardants are incorporated into resin systems to enhance the flame retardancy of a particular polymer 
should a customer decide to use a different polymer due to price  performance or other considerations  we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer s new requirements 
consequently  it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use 
our business  results of operations  cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 
our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 
the specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements 
in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive  we must successfully develop  manufacture and market new or improved products 
as a result  we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development 
ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 
additionally  for any new product program  there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs 
moreover  new products may have lower margins than the products they replace 
we also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products 
for example  the fine chemicals segment is experiencing increased competition from large scale producers of pharmachemicals  particularly from asian sources 
in our catalysts segment  our petroleum refinery customers are processing crude oil feedstocks of declining quality  while at the same time operating under increasingly stringent regulations requiring the gasoline  diesel and other fuels they produce to contain fewer impurities  including sulfur 
as a result  our petroleum refining customers are demanding more effective and efficient catalysts products  and the average life cycle for new catalysts products has declined 
as new products enter the market  our products may become obsolete or competitors products may be marketed more effectively than our products 
if we fail to develop new products  maintain or improve our margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will suffer 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
protection of our proprietary processes  methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business 
we generally rely on patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright laws of the united states and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold  as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements  to protect our intellectual property rights 
the patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies 
additionally  some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and  even if a patent application has been filed  it may not result in an issued patent 
if patents are issued to us  those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 
we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or rendered unenforceable 
we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies 
if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others  we may be liable for damages  and we may be required to change our processes  to redesign our products partially or completely  to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely 
even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit  the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits 
we may not prevail in any intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 
we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise  continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property  we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached  that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 
our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the united states 
we and our joint ventures currently have approximately facilities located outside the united states  including facilities and offices located in austria  belgium  brazil  france  germany  italy  japan  jordan  korea  the netherlands  the people s republic of china  saudi arabia and the united kingdom 
we expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales and the net sales of our joint ventures 
accordingly  our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal  political  social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions 
risks inherent in international operations include the following fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in us dollars of products and services we provide in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency  transportation and other shipping costs may increase  intellectual property rights may be more difficult to enforce  foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income  or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment  including currency exchange controls  unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements may occur  agreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may be burdensome  unexpected adverse changes in export duties  quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses  general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations in those countries  foreign operations may experience staffing difficulties and labor disputes  foreign governments may nationalize private enterprises  and 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries our business and profitability in a particular country could be affected by political or economic repercussions on a domestic  country specific or global level from terrorist activities and the response to such activities 
in addition  certain of our joint ventures operate in high risk regions of the world such as the middle east and south america 
unanticipated events  such as geopolitical changes  could result in a write down of our investment in the affected joint venture 
our success as a global business will depend  in part  upon our ability to succeed in differing legal  regulatory  economic  social and political conditions by developing  implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 
we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate 
the financial condition and results of operations of each foreign operating subsidiary and joint venture are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities as foreign assets and liabilities that are translated into us dollars for presentation in our financial statements as well as our net sales  cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
the main foreign currencies for which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the european union euro  japanese yen and british pound sterling 
exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future 
significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currency denominated debt outstanding 
in addition to currency translation risks  we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it receives revenues 
our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 
we incur substantial costs in order to comply with extensive environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
in the jurisdictions in which we operate  we are subject to numerous federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties 
ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts 
environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years 
we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 
violations of environmental  health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines  penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices 
if we violate environmental  health and safety laws or regulations  in addition to being required to correct such violations  we can be held liable in administrative  civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations 
liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances  as well as personal injury  property damages or natural resource damages arising out of such hazardous substances  may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault  and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved  or even the entire loss 
such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue  including  for example  entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property  as well as entities that currently own or operate such property 
such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict 
we use  and in the past have used  hazardous substances at many of our facilities  and we have in the past  and may in the future  be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material 
we also have generated  and continue to generate  hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities 
some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination 
we have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no longer own or operate 
the nature of our business  including historical operations at our current and former facilities  exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production  storage  use  transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment 
additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites  and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable  that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries contractual indemnities may be ineffective in protecting us from environmental liabilities 
at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated  we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators  however  in the event we make a claim  the indemnifier may disagree with us 
if our contractual indemnity is not upheld  our accrual and or our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 
concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation  or reaction in our markets independent of regulation  that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 
we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups 
for example  for many years we have marketed methyl bromide  a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant 
in recent years  the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly  driven by the montreal protocol of and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemical s potential to deplete the ozone layer 
completion of the phase out of methyl bromide as a fumigant took effect january  with continued use for critical uses allowed on an annual basis until feasible alternatives are available 
in addition  there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities  legislative bodies and environmental interest groups of polybrominated diphenylethers  or pbdes  which are used as flame retardants 
we manufacture decabrom pde  a type of pbde compound 
in  our net sales of decabrom pde were less than of total net sales 
government regulation  including a ban on the use of decabrom pde in certain applications  if it occurs  or the threat of regulation  even if governmental regulation does not occur  may result in a decline in our net sales of decabrom pde 
we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 
our products provide important performance attributes to our customers products 
if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed  a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed 
these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because  in certain instances  we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees 
a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers 
we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside our control 
based on an average interest rate of at january  and outstanding borrowings at that date of million  our annual interest expense would be approximately million 
a change of in the interest rate applicable to such borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately million 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations  particularly if currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements are not realized on schedule or at all 
if we are unable to service our debt obligations  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity  reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets or raise additional equity 
we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all  which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 
our senior credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes contain restrictive covenants 
these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility 
the failure to comply with the covenants in the senior credit agreement  the indenture governing the senior notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness  including indebtedness incurred in the future  could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a downgrading of the ratings on our debt or an increase in interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase 
borrowings under our senior credit agreement bear interest at floating rates 
the rates are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured long term debt by standard poor s ratings services or s p and moody s investors services  or moody s 
s p has rated our senior unsecured long term debt as bbb and moody s has rated our senior unsecured long term debt as 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries baa s p and or moody s may  in the future  downgrade our ratings 
the downgrading of our ratings or an increase in benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on borrowings under our senior credit agreement 
in addition  the downgrading of our ratings could adversely affect our future ability to obtain funding or materially increase the cost of any additional funding 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses  any of which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing  storage  handling and transportation  including explosions  fires  inclement weather  natural disasters  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  transportation interruptions  remediation  chemical spills  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to  or destruction of  property and equipment and environmental contamination 
in addition  the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals 
accordingly  these hazards  and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole  including our results of operations and cash flows  both during and after the period of operational difficulties 
the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 
we maintain property  business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations  including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered 
we may incur losses beyond the limits  or outside the coverage  of our insurance policies  including liabilities for environmental remediation 
in addition  from time to time  various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or  in some cases  have not been available at all 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels  and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 
we may incur significant charges in the event we close all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 
we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner 
based on our assessments  we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units  move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility  discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 
we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised  we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations 
the closure of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges which could be significant 
if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel  it could have an adverse effect on our business 
the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business 
in addition  because of the specialized and technical nature of our business  our future performance is dependent on the continued service of  and on our ability to attract and retain  qualified management  scientific  technical  marketing and support personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel 
some of our employees are unionized  represented by workers councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the united states 
as of december   we had  employees 
approximately of our  us employees are unionized 
two of our collective bargaining agreements expire in and one expires in in addition  a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the united states 
such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements 
for example  most of our employees in europe are represented by workers councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment  including salaries and benefits and staff changes  and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce 
although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees  a strike  work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 
our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations  which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 
we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future 
the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties 
if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations  the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan 
in that case  our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture 
also  differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues 
if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans  our results of operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate future acquisitions into our business  which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
as part of our business growth strategy  we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future 
our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources  including available cash and borrowing capacity 
the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures  the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully  could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
furthermore  we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 
the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  unforeseen claims and liabilities  including unexpected environmental exposures  unforeseen adjustments  charges and write offs  problems enforcing the indemnification obligations of sellers of businesses or joint venture partners for claims and liabilities  unexpected losses of customers of  or suppliers to  the acquired business  difficulty in conforming the acquired business standards  processes  procedures and controls with our operations  variability in financial information arising from the implementation of purchase price accounting  inability to coordinate new product and process development  loss of senior managers and other critical personnel and problems with new labor unions  and challenges arising from the increased scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
although our pension plans are currently adequately funded  events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 
we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world  including in the united states  the netherlands  germany  belgium  france and japan  covering most of our employees 
the us plans represent approximately of the total liabilities of the plans worldwide 
we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries benefit and tax laws 
the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans actuaries 
during  we made no contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans 
our us qualified defined benefit pension plans in aggregate were approximately funded on an irs funding basis as of december  and  as a result  there are no required cash contributions to the plans in nor do we anticipate making discretionary contributions to the plans during however  the actual amount of contributions could vary depending on factors such as asset returns  then current interest rates  and legislative changes 
the amount we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly 
these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 
the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events  including domestic and international terrorist attacks  may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 
chemical related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the united states  or us  and throughout the world 
as an acc member company  we have completed vulnerability assessments of our us manufacturing locations and met the requirements of this industry standard 
we have a corporate security standard and audit our facilities for compliance 
recent investments have been made to upgrade site security 
however  federal legislation is under consideration that could impose new site security requirements  specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities  which may increase our overhead expenses 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries new federal regulations have already been adopted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the united states 
we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered 
we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous 
bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington  dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations 
broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 
the occurrence of extraordinary events  including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities  cannot be predicted  and their occurrence can be expected to continue to affect negatively the economy in general  and specifically the markets for our products 
the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets  or assets used by us  could include loss of life and property damage 
in addition  available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or  if available  may be prohibitively expensive

on july   we received a notice of violation nov from the us environmental protection agency region epa regarding the implementation of the pharmaceutical maximum achievable control technology standards at our plant in orangeburg  sc 
the alleged violations include i the applicability of the specific regulations to certain intermediates manufactured at the plant  ii failure to comply with certain reporting requirements  iii improper evaluation and testing to properly implement the regulations and iv the sufficiency of the leak detection and repair program at the plant 
we are currently engaged in discussions with the epa seeking to resolve these allegations  but no assurances can be given that we will be able to reach a resolution that is acceptable to both parties 
any settlement or finding adverse to us could result in the payment by us of fines  penalties  capital expenditures  or some combination thereof 
at this time  it is not possible to predict with any certainty the outcome of our discussions with the epa or the financial impact  which may result there from 
however  we do not expect any financial impact to have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types regarded as common in our businesses  particularly administrative or judicial proceedings seeking remediation under environmental laws  such as superfund  products liability and premises liability litigation 
we maintain a financial accrual for these proceedings that includes defense costs and potential damages  as estimated by our general counsel

the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
the following is a discussion and analysis of results of operations for the years ended december   and a discussion of consolidated financial condition and sources of additional capital is included under a separate heading financial condition and liquidity on page overview and outlook we are a leading global developer  manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered specialty chemicals 
our products and services enhance the value of our customers end products by improving performance  providing essential product attributes  lowering cost and simplifying processing 
we sell a highly diversified mix of products to a wide range of customers  including 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries manufacturers of consumer electronics  building and construction materials  automotive parts  packaging  pharmachemicals and agrichemicals  and petroleum refiners 
we believe that our commercial and geographic diversity  technical expertise  flexible  low cost global manufacturing base  and experienced management team enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate 
growth of our polymer additives segment is expected to be derived from increasing demand for electrical and electronic equipment  new construction and increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in many countries around the world 
growth in our catalysts segment is expected to be driven by increasing demand for petroleum products  generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements as a part of anti pollution initiatives 
the fine chemicals segment continues to benefit from the continued rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products  coupled with a movement by pharmaceutical companies to outsource certain research  product development and manufacturing functions 
highlights divestiture of thann  france facility 
in  we entered into a share purchase agreement pursuant to which we transferred all of the capital stock of albemarle france sas asas to international chemical investors sa icig for nominal consideration 
thann was our potassium and chlorine facility with approximately million in revenues and a history of low profitability 
in connection with the disposition of the thann facility to icig  we recorded a charge amounting to million million after income taxes  or per share 
we expect the total net after tax cash costs of the transaction to be less than million 
this divestiture was part of our strategic focus on fiscal improvements in our fine chemicals segment 
acquisition of south haven  michigan facility 
we acquired dsm s south haven  michigan fine chemicals facility during the third quarter this acquisition assists our ongoing effort to reposition the fine chemicals segment around services and higher value activities 
belgian based european trading company 
we have completed the implementation of a belgian based european trading company that centralized certain european activities at a single focal point and enables us to pay down external debt faster than we would otherwise 
the benefit of this structure provides approximately million monthly  or million annually  in tax savings on a sustainable basis that began in the third quarter of this year 
as part of this trading company structure  we have relocated certain of our long term debt  approximately million  from the us to europe  where we will be able to use lower taxed foreign earnings to repay it locally 
technology advances 
we continued to leverage our technological expertise by developing and introducing new products 
in we filed over patents  ending the year with approximately of our sales from products that were not in our portfolio five years ago 
stock repurchase plan 
during  we repurchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions at an average price of per share 
debt reduction 
we reduced our total debt by over million  lowering our debt to capitalization ratio to approximately 
we reduced our total net debt by over million  lowering our net debt to capitalization ratio to approximately 
we define net debt as total debt plus the portion of outstanding joint venture indebtedness guaranteed by us or less the portion of outstanding joint venture indebtedness consolidated but not guaranteed by us  less cash and cash equivalents 
increased dividends 
we increased our dividends for the th consecutive year  ending the year at an annual dividend rate of per share 
in february  we increased our quarterly dividend to per share of common stock 
outlook polymer additives growth of our polymer additives segment is expected to be derived from increasing demand for electrical and electronic equipment  new construction and increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in many countries around the world 
in  we expect stable volumes and continued pricing initiatives to offset raw material and energy costs that continue to rise 
we believe that in this segment may become our first billion dollar revenue market segment 
we are continuing our progress in china as a foundation for expanding our business in asia 
our technology center in nanjing is now operational 
this center provides technical support for our polymer additives customers in the asia pacific region 
in addition  we plan to build a phosphorous flame retardant plant in nanjing  which we believe could be fully operational in the second half of we intend to produce phosphorous flame retardants at this site to serve the growing asian construction and electronic markets 
catalysts revenue growth in our catalysts segment is expected to be modest in as compared to  being driven by global demand for petroleum products  generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock and implementation of more stringent 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries fuel quality requirements as a part of anti pollution initiatives 
we expect catalyst profit growth in will come primarily from new product introductions  new markets that we penetrate  fcc pricing improvements and the continued growth in our polyolefin catalyst business 
we expect conventional hpc catalysts volumes to remain stable for the entire year 
although refinery loading for new diesel sulfur specifications that went into effect in the united states on october  is now complete  we expect technology advantages and new product innovations will offset potential weakness in hpc in as oil prices remain elevated  we believe refiners will use more sour crudes  which will require hpc catalysts to remove the metals and impurities  further driving demand for these catalysts 
we have begun construction of our new hpc catalysts plant at bayport  texas  which is expected to be operational in second half of this plant will add approximately  metric tons to our capacity 
we are evaluating whether additional capacity expansion in and may be needed due to expected increased demand 
our focus in fcc catalysts is on improving margins to support the value these products bring to the market 
in  we announced the first significant price increase for these catalysts in over ten years and have focused in on achieving these increases 
in addition  we expect to see incremental benefits in future quarters on our most recent fcc price increase that went into effect in january we believe that these price increases will help partially offset the increasing raw material and energy costs to manufacture these catalysts and will allow margin recovery and expansion for these catalysts 
we are focused on new product development in catalysts  and have introduced high throughput experimentation to more rapidly test and develop new technologies 
our marketing and research groups are tightly aligned so we can continue to bring innovative technologies to the market 
we will continue to explore new opportunities for our catalysts in the alternative fuels business which include biodiesel  canadian tar sands  gas to liquids gtl and coal to liquids ctl markets 
these opportunities become increasingly viable as oil remains at historically high levels 
fine chemicals the fine chemicals segment continues to benefit from the continued rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products  coupled with a movement by pharmaceutical companies to outsource certain research  product development and manufacturing functions 
we expect to continue the turnaround of our fine chemicals segment in as our revenue base is smaller following the sale of our thann  france facility  we expect profitability to improve in in addition to an overall focus on margin improvement  our two strategic areas of focus in fine chemicals have been to maximize our bromine franchise value and to continue the growth of our fine chemistry services business 
our goal is to profitably grow our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets 
we will also continue our focus on developing our fine chemistry services business 
our new products pipeline in this business has approximately doubled in the last three years  allowing us to develop preferred outsourcing positions serving leading chemical innovators in diverse industries 
we remain confident in continuing to generate growth in profitable niche products leveraged from this service business 
corporate and other the benefit of the belgian based european trading company provides approximately million monthly  or million annually  in tax savings on a sustainable basis that began in the third quarter of as part of this trading company structure  we have relocated certain of our long term debt  approximately million  from the us to europe  where we believe we will be able to use lower taxed foreign earnings to repay it locally 
in  incremental income is more likely to be earned in locales with higher incremental rates 
we believe our global effective tax rate may approximate  but it will vary based on the locales in which incremental income is actually recognized 
we are continuing our focus on reducing working capital and repaying debt in we have increased our quarterly dividend payout in to per share 
under our existing share repurchase program  we expect to accelerate the amount of shares repurchased in as compared to we continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions that complement our business footprint

for  our catalysts segment income included purchase price adjustments for the step up accounting values assigned to the acquired refinery catalysts business inventory of million and the write off of million of purchased in process r d charges associated with the acquisition 
excluding these adjustments  our catalysts segment income increased million  or  from fine chemicals fine chemicals segment net sales for were million  up million  or  versus this increase was due mainly to pricing improvements of across the bromine portfolio and increased prices of in our fine chemistry services and improved volumes of in both our bromine portfolio and our fine chemistry services

summary of critical accounting policies estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be significant in the preparation of the financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate losses for uncollectible accounts based on the aging of receivables and the evaluation of the likelihood of success in collecting the receivables 
we also provide for claims receivables that are subject to legal proceedings 
depreciation 
depreciation is computed primarily by the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we have a policy where our internal engineering group provides asset life guidelines for book purposes 
these guidelines are 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries reviewed against the economic life of the business for each project  and asset life is determined as the lesser of the manufacturing life or the business life 
the engineering guidelines are reviewed periodically 
inventory obsolescence 
inventories are reviewed on a quarterly basis to determine age  movement and turnover 
reserves are setup periodically based upon estimates to adjust inventory values in line with their net realizable value 
recovery of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recovery of our long lived assets on a segment basis by periodically analyzing our operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 
acquisition accounting 
we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities when allocating the purchase price of an acquisition 
income taxes 
we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets 
legal accruals 
we estimate the amount of potential exposure and anticipated cost to defend that we may incur with respect to litigation  claims and assessments 
performance and life cycle guarantees 
we provide customers certain performance guarantees and life cycle guarantees 
these guarantees entitle the customer to claim compensation if the product does not conform to performance standards originally agreed upon 
performance guarantees relate to minimum technical specifications that products produced with the delivered product must meet  such as yield and product quality 
life cycle guarantees relate to minimum periods for which performance of the delivered product is guaranteed 
when either performance guarantees or life cycle guarantees are contractually agreed upon  an assessment of the appropriate revenue recognition treatment is evaluated 
environmental remediation liabilities 
we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on site specific facts and circumstances 
cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter  the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan  and the extent of other parties share of responsibility 
actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable  and has been earned  in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer  which usually occurs at the time shipment is made 
the majority of our sales are sold free on board fob shipping point or on an equivalent basis  other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements 
our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale  order confirmation documents and invoices 
we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed 
we have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts 
claims receivable we record receivables for non trade claims on a case by case basis whenever management deems that the claim for recovery is probable 
recording of such receivables is preceded by the gathering and evaluation of factually supportable evidence and conditions surrounding the claim  and is generally based on application of specific contractual terms with third parties from which the claim arises 
in accordance with gaap  we evaluate these receivables for collectibility on a regular basis  and we record provisions for uncollectible amounts when subsequent conditions indicate that collection of all or part of the receivable is not probable 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets not be amortized 
we test goodwill for impairment using a two step method by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value 
we measure the fair value based on present value techniques involving cash flows consistent with the objective of measuring fair value based on reasonable and supportive assumptions 
we test our recorded goodwill balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries definite lived intangible assets  such as purchased technology  patents  customer lists and trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives  generally for periods ranging from three to thirty five years 
we continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets 
see note  goodwill and other intangibles 
pension plans and other postretirement benefits we follow the guidance of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of certain requirements of fasb statements no 
 and r  sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  when accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
as required under sfas no 
 we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of the pension or postretirement benefit plans equal to the plan s funded status as of the measurement date 
the difference between a plan s funded status and its balance sheet position prior to adoption of the standard is recognized  net of tax  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after december  and is to be applied prospectively 
amounts provided for years prior to  contain delayed recognition differences between actual results and expected or estimated results based on the prior guiding principle of the standards 
the delayed recognition of actual results allowed for the recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans 
the primary assumptions are as follows discount rate the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits  which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 
expected return on plan assets we project the future return on plan assets based on prior performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plans as well as the expected long term allocation of plan assets for these investments 
these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs recorded currently 
rate of compensation increase for salary related plans  we project employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we project the expected increases in the cost of covered health care benefits 
during  we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate  the rate of compensation increase for salary related plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits 
we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 
in selecting the discount rate  consideration is given to fixed income security yields  including high quality bonds moody s aa and the international index company  or iboxx  aa corporate bond rates  along with a yield curve applied to the payments we expect to make out of our retirement plans 
the yield curve was produced for a universe containing us issued aa graded corporate bonds  all of which were non callable  non putable and non sinkable 
for each plan  the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments 
at december   the weighted average discount rate was increased for the pension plans from to and for the other postretirement plans from to as a result of higher market rates and a relatively flat yield curve for long term high quality bonds 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long term allocation of plan assets to these investments 
at december   the weighted average expected rate of return on pension plan assets was reduced from to and there was no change in the weighted average expected return on other postretirement benefit plan assets 
our us defined benefit plan for non represented employees was closed to new participants effective march  we adopted a defined contribution pension plan for us employees hired after march  in projecting the rate of compensation increase  we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates 
at december  and  the assumed weighted average rate of compensation increase was and  respectively  for the pension plans 
the assumed weighted average rate of compensation increase was and for the other postretirement plans at december  and  respectively 
in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits  we consider past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends 
at december   the previously assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees was increased 
the assumed health care cost trend rate for and for pre coverage was per year  dropping by per year to an ultimate rate of in year and  respectively 
the trend rate for post coverage was per year  dropping by per year to an ultimate rate of in the year and  respectively 
for  
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries the trend rate for pre coverage is again increased to per year  dropping by per year to an ultimate rate of in the year the trend rate for post coverage is increased to per year  dropping by per year to an ultimate rate of in the year the postretirement medical benefits provided to employees in the netherlands who retire after august includes an assumed increase in benefits of per year 
however  we elected that effective january  the netherlands postretirement medical benefits would lapse 
therefore  this plan will be settled in january and we will have no future liabilities under this plan 
the effect of a increase in the us health care cost trend rate would increase the benefit cost components by million and would increase the benefit obligation by million 
a decrease in the us heath care cost trend rate would decrease the benefit cost components by million and would decrease the benefit obligation by million 
a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations  the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities  and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions  primarily in the united states in thousands favorable unfavorable increase decrease increase decrease in benefit obligation increase decrease in benefit cost increase decrease in benefit obligation increase decrease in benefit cost actuarial assumptions discount rate pension other postretirement benefits expected return on plan assets pension other postretirement benefits rate of increase decrease in per capita cost of covered health care benefits not applicable income taxes we use the liability method for determining our income taxes  under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses and certain tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance  reducing deferred tax assets  is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we are subject to periodic audit of our income tax returns by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business 
we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years  based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter  which result primarily from intercompany transfer pricing  tax benefits from the foreign sales corporation and extra territorial income tax rules 
in the united states  the internal revenue service has completed a review of our income tax returns through the year in  tax assessments were received from the irs for the years through we have taken the issues contested to the appeals process 
our financial statements reflect the outcome we believe will ultimately result from this appeals process given the uncertainty that exists in the appeals process and the lack of assurances of the anticipated outcome 
for the years after  our income tax returns are either under review by the irs or could be subject to the irs review 
prior to september   except as otherwise noted  it was our policy to record deferred income tax liabilities on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that were not deemed to be permanently reinvested in those operations 
as of september   we designated the undistributed earnings of substantially all of our foreign operations as permanently reinvested and as a result recorded a tax benefit of million due to the reversal of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities 
we will not provide for deferred income taxes on the future earnings of these subsidiaries as a result of this designation 
our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits  or e p  principles 
in general  to the extent our financial reporting 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these e p amounts  deferred taxes have not been provided as they are essentially permanent in duration 
the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable 
as further discussed in note  income taxes  we asserted that we are permanently reinvested with respect to earnings derived from our investment in jbc for all periods beginning after september  investments we have investments in joint ventures  nonmarketable securities and marketable equity securities 
the majority of our investments are in joint ventures 
since we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of these joint ventures  they are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee between and  although other factors  such as representation on the investee s board of directors and the impact of commercial arrangements  are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate 
our share of the investee s earnings is included in the consolidated statement of income as equity in net income of unconsolidated investments 
it is also included in our computation of segment income 
investments in marketable securities are accounted for as both available for sale securities with changes in fair value included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets and trading equities that are marked to market on a monthly basis through the consolidated statement of income 
joint ventures and nonmarketable securities results for immaterial entities are estimated based upon the overall performance of the entity where financial results are not available on a timely basis 
internal control over financial reporting section of the sarbanes oxley act of or sox  requires that we make an assertion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form k filings 
our independent registered public accounting firm  pricewaterhousecoopers llp  attests to our management s assertion and provides its assessment of our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
in order to make our assertion  we are required to identify material financial and operational processes  document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls 
see management s report on internal control over financial reporting in part i  item a 
we have a dedicated sox team in house to facilitate ongoing internal control reviews  coordinate the process for these reviews  provide direction to the business groups and corporate staff involved in the initiative and assist in the assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
a steering committee  comprised of personnel from finance and alliance services  is in place to set uniform guiding principles and policies  review the progress of the compliance activities and direct the efforts of the sox team 
status updates are provided to our audit committee of our board of directors on an ongoing basis 
we also retain an accounting firm other than our independent registered public accounting firm to assist us in our compliance with sox our sox effort involves many of our employees around the world  including participation by our business areas and our alliance services group 
we view our ongoing evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as more than a regulatory exercise it is an opportunity to continually assess our financial control environment and make us even stronger 
financial condition and liquidity overview the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been investment in our assets  funding working capital  and repayment of debt 
cash to fund the needs of our business has been provided primarily by operations  debt financing  and equity issuances 
we expect business activity levels to continue to increase over the next twelve to twenty four months 
the increase in business activity may cause our working capital needs to increase 
we have initiated a program to improve working capital efficiency and working capital metrics particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory 
we expect our current cash balances and our availability under our revolving credit facility  which is discussed below  to be sufficient to fund working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
cash flow our cash balance increased by million to million at december  from million at december  for  our operations provided million of cash compared to million in primarily due to an increase in net income excluding the net thann divestiture charge as well as a net improvement in working capital accounts 
cash flows from operating activities funded investing activities of million  which consisted principally of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment improvements  the acquisition of the assets and fine chemistry services and pharmaceuticals business 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries associated with the south haven  michigan facility of dsm pharmaceutical products dsm and thann facility divestiture payments 
remaining cash flows from operating activities together with proceeds from borrowings of million and the exercise of stock options of million  funded long term debt repayments of million  purchases of our common stock of million and quarterly dividends to shareholders 
this resulted in net cash used by financing activity of million 
net current assets increased million to million at december  from million at december  the increase in net current assets was due primarily to an increase in cash partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and income taxes payable 
cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  up million from million at year end for  cash flows provided from operating activities of million  together with approximately million and million proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and common stock  respectively  million of proceeds from borrowings and million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options  were used to cover operating activities  repay debt of million  fund capital expenditures totaling million  pay quarterly dividends to shareholders of million  fund investments amounting to million  pay dividends to minority interest of million  pay million in financing costs  and increase cash and cash equivalents by million 
our foreign currency translation adjustments  net of related deferred taxes  included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity on pages and increased from december   primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro 
accumulated other comprehensive loss income also includes unrecognized losses and prior service benefit for our defined benefit plans in accordance with sfas no 
capital expenditures in of million were approximately higher than the level of million to expand capacities at existing facilities to support an expected increase in sales 
we expect our capital spending program to be approximately million in and capital spending in for environmental and safety projects is expected to be higher than that of  which was slightly lower than that in  driven by environmental regulations and our commitment towards sustainability goals 
we anticipate that future capital spending will be financed primarily with cash flow provided from operations with additional cash needed  if any  provided by borrowings  including borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 
long term debt we currently have million of senior notes that are due in these notes are senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding 
the senior notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured indebtedness and to existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries 
we may redeem the senior notes before their maturity  in whole at any time or in part from time to time  at a redemption price equal to the greater of of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semi annual basis assuming a day year consisting of twelve day months at the treasury rate as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes plus basis points  plus  in each case  accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption 
the principal amount of the senior notes becomes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries and may be declared immediately due and payable by the trustee or the holders of not less than of the senior notes upon the occurrence of an event of default 
events of default include  among other things failure to pay principal or interest at required times  failure to perform or remedy a breach of covenants within prescribed periods  an event of default on any of our other indebtedness or certain of our subsidiaries of million or more that is caused by a failure to make a payment when due or that results in the acceleration of that indebtedness before its maturity  and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries 
for additional funding and liquidity purposes  we currently maintain a senior credit agreement with financial institutions that consists of a million revolving credit facility and a million five year term loan facility 
in june  we amended our senior credit facilities to add certain additional subsidiary borrowers located outside the us and to allow borrowings by our foreign subsidiaries to be denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
key terms of this agreement remain unchanged 
there was an aggregate of million equivalent outstanding under the five year term loan facility at december  the aggregate of million equivalent outstanding was comprised of million of borrowings denominated in us dollars borrowed by domestic subsidiaries and million million based on the applicable exchange rate on december  of borrowings denominated in euros borrowed by a subsidiary in the netherlands 
borrowings under the five year term loan facility bear interest at variable rates  which was a weighted average of for the year ended december  as of december   borrowings under the domestic portion of the million five year term loan facility bore a variable interest rate of per annum 
the 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries million five year term loan facility is payable in quarterly installments of million and million million based on the applicable exchange rate on december  through june   and quarterly payments of million and million million based on the applicable exchange rate on december  at september   december  and march  borrowings under our senior credit agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following financial covenants a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  must be greater than or equal to as of the end of any fiscal quarter  b consolidated debt to capitalization ratio  as defined  at the end of any fiscal quarter must be less than or equal to  c consolidated tangible domestic assets  as defined  must be or greater than or equal to million for us to make investments in entities and enterprises that are organized outside the united states  and d with the exception of liens specified in our new senior credit agreement  liens may not attach to assets where the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens at any time exceeds of consolidated net worth  as defined in the agreements 
we believe that as of december   we were  and currently are  in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
noncompliance with any one or more of the debt covenants may have an adverse effect on financial condition or liquidity in the event such noncompliance cannot be cured or should we be unable to obtain a waiver from the lenders 
renegotiation of the covenant through an amendment to the senior credit agreement may effectively cure the noncompliance  but may have an effect on financial condition or liquidity depending upon how the covenant is renegotiated 
the noncurrent portion of our long term debt amounted to million at december   compared to million at december  in addition  at december   we had the ability to borrow an additional million under our various credit arrangements 
other obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for plant construction  purchases of equipment  unused letters of credit  and various take or pay and throughput agreements in thousands thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligation expected interest payments on long term debt obligations operating lease obligations rental take or pay throughput agreements letters of credit and guarantees capital projects facility divestiture obligation additional investment commitment payments total these amounts are based on a weighted average interest rate of for term loans  for variable rate long term debt obligations  a capital lease and the senior notes for the weighted average rate for years and thereafter is for term loans and for the variable rate long term debt obligations  a capital lease and the senior notes 
liquidity outlook we anticipate that cash provided from operating activities in the future and borrowings under our senior credit agreement will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses  satisfy debt service obligations  fund capital expenditures and make dividend payments for the foreseeable future 
for flexibility  we maintain a shelf registration statement that permits us to issue from time to time a range of securities  including common stock  preferred stock and senior and subordinated debt of up to million 
in addition  as we have historically done  we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses  which may require additional liquidity 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries capitalization on january   we completed the concurrent public offerings of  shares  on a split adjusted basis  of our common stock of which an aggregate of  shares were sold by a member of the family of fd gottwald  jr 
and certain affiliates of the family  and million of senior notes due we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of these shares by the selling shareholders 
our portion of the common stock offering sale  after the inclusion of  over allotment shares requested and sold by our underwriters  which was completed on january   totaled  shares 
the shares of common stock were offered and sold at a public offering price of per share and the senior notes were offered and sold at a public offering price of of par 
we used the net proceeds from both of our offerings to repay the million day bridge loan that we incurred in connection with our acquisition of the refinery catalysts business 
safety and environmental matters we are subject to federal  state  local  and foreign requirements regulating the handling  manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies  the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment 
to our knowledge  we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws  regulations  statutes and ordinances 
compliance with existing federal  state  local  and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have in the future a material effect on earnings or our competitive position  but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 
among other environmental requirements  we are subject to the federal superfund law  and similar state laws  under which we may be designated as a potentially responsible party  or prp  and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites 
management believes that in most cases  our participation is de minimis 
further  almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated  studied and in many cases settled 
in de minimis situations  our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement  enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp  except for remote contingencies 
in other than de minimis prp matters  our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial 
we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs 
because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters  we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to operations 
our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were approximately million in versus approximately million in and million in  excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures  and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years 
costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities  which at december  totaled approximately million  up million from million at december  we believe that most of the amount we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded  if any  should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations  but could have a material adverse impact in any particular quarterly reporting period 
see also item legal proceedings on page capital expenditures for pollution abatement and safety projects  including such costs that are included in other projects  were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for each of the next few years  capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and working towards sustainability goals 
management s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollution abatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations  and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful  or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  or sab sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity in practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
sab requires that registrants quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstated amount that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have any impact on our reported results of operations 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment  or sfas no 
r 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based awards under the intrinsic value method  which followed the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
the intrinsic value method of accounting resulted in compensation expense for restricted stock awards at fair value on date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock at grant date and for stock options to the extent exercise prices were set below market prices on the date of grant 
compensation expense for performance unit awards was recognized based on the number of units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at the end of each quarterly reporting period until distribution 
to the extent restricted stock awards and performance unit awards were forfeited prior to vesting  the corresponding previously recognized expense was reversed as an offset to operating expenses 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method  which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the modified prospective method does not require financial amounts for the prior periods presented in this form k to be restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing share based compensation 
the fair value of restricted stock awards and performance unit awards is determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at grant date  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
to the extent restricted stock awards  performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting  the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses 
the application of sfas no 
r had the following effect on december  reported amounts relative to amounts that would have been reported using the intrinsic value method under previous accounting in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  operating profit income before income taxes  minority interests and equity in net income of unconsolidated investments net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share net cash provided from operating activities net cash used in provided from financing activities the impact of sfas no 
r resulted in additional compensation expense related to stock options not fully vested as of january  million 
this was more than offset by the benefit of not recording additional compensation expense during for outstanding performance unit awards which otherwise would have been required under previous accounting standards 
under those standards  performance units were required to be recorded at fair value at the end of each reporting period 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  performance units are now based on a grant date fair value 
consequently  our stock based compensation expense associated with outstanding performance unit awards was favorably impacted by million during the current year as the fair value at grant date was lower than the fair value at the end of the reporting period  or december  the following table illustrates the effects on net income and earnings per share for the years ended december  and as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary currencies for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling and the us dollar in certain of its foreign locations 
in response to the greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods  we have increased the degree of risk management activities to minimize the impact on earnings of future periods 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from time to time of foreign exchange contracts 
the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks and or costs associated with global operating activities 
the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the other parties  and no material loss would be expected from their nonperformance 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  which generally expire within one year  in the regular course of business to assist in managing our exposure against foreign currency fluctuations on sales and intercompany transactions 
the primary method to cover foreign currency exposure is to seek a natural hedge  in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures 
in the event a natural hedge is not available  a foreign currency forward contract may be employed to reduce currency exposure 
while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying foreign currency exposures being hedged 
gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income  but do not have a significant impact on results of operations 
our financial instruments  subject to foreign currency exchange risk  consist of foreign currency forward contracts 
at december   no such contracts were outstanding 
in connection with the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business  we entered into foreign currency forward hedging contracts to partially hedge the purchase price  which was denominated in euros 
as a result  we incurred a net charge of approximately million during the year ended december  we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage the worldwide exposure of our interest rate risks and foreign exchange exposure through our regular operations and financing activities 
we had outstanding variable interest rate borrowings at december  of million  bearing an average interest rate of 
a change of in the interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately million 
we may enter into interest rate swaps  collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 
our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather  supply conditions  political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors 
historically  we have not used futures  options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 
however  the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide long term protection against changes in metals prices 
we seek to limit our exposure by entering into long term contracts when available  and we seek price increase limitations through contracts 
these contracts do not have a significant impact on results of operations 
in  we entered into treasury lock agreements  or t locks  with a notional value of million  to fix the yield on the us treasury security used to set the yield for approximately of our january public offering of senior notes 
the t locks fixed the yield on the us treasury security at approximately 
the value of the t locks resulted from the difference between the yield to maturity of the year us treasury security that had the maturity date most comparable to the maturity date of the notes issued and the fixed rate of approximately 
the cumulative loss effect of the t lock agreements was million and is being amortized over the life of the notes as an adjustment to the notes interest expense 
at december   there were unrealized losses of approximately million million after income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss income that remain to be expensed 
in addition  certain of our operations use natural gas as a source of energy which can expose our business to market risk when the price of natural gas changes suddenly 
in an attempt to mitigate the impact and volatility of price swings in the natural gas market  we purchase natural gas contracts  when appropriate  for a portion of our month rolling forecast for north american natural gas requirements 
our natural gas hedge transactions are executed with a major financial institution 
such derivatives are held to secure natural gas at fixed prices and not for trading 
our natural gas contracts qualify as cash flow hedges and are marked to market 
the unrealized gains and or losses on these contracts are deferred and accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive loss income to the extent that the unrealized gains and losses are offset by the forecasted transaction 
at december   there were no natural gas hedge contracts outstanding 
additionally  any unrealized gains and or losses on the derivative instrument that are not offset by the forecasted transaction are recorded in earnings as appropriate  but do not have a significant impact on results of operations
