table of contents autodesk subscription program and autodesk upgrade program in addition to sales of new software licenses  we offer our customers two ways to migrate to the most recent version of our products the autodesk subscription program and the autodesk upgrade program 
these programs are available for a majority of our products 
autodesk subscription program maintenance services under the autodesk subscription program  customers who own a perpetual use license for the most recent version of the underlying product are able to purchase a subscription that provides them with unspecified upgrades when and if available  download e learning courses and obtain optional on line support over a one year or multi year subscription period 
revenues from our subscription program are reported separately on our consolidated statements of income and are referred to throughout this document as maintenance revenue 
autodesk upgrade program the autodesk upgrade program allows customers to purchase upgrades  but only to the extent that they are still on a supported version of the product 
typically  the cost to upgrade is based on a multiple of the number of versions the customer is upgrading 
an existing customer also has the option to upgrade to a different  more recent discipline specific or d product  which generally has a higher price  for a premium fee  we refer to this as a crossgrade 
the cost of a crossgrade is substantially less than the cost of purchasing a new seat and is available to subscription customers as well 
revenues from our upgrade and crossgrade programs are reported on our consolidated statements of income in license and other 
product development and introduction we continue to enhance our product offerings and develop new products to meet changing customer demands 
research and development expenditures were million or of fiscal net revenues  million or of fiscal net revenues and million or of fiscal net revenues 
our software is primarily developed internally  however  we do contract services from software development firms  consultants and independent contractors to supplement our development efforts 
additionally  we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing some or all of the assets or stock of the entity that owns rights to the technology 
for example  in april  we acquired a ownership in hanna strategies holdings  inc hanna strategies  a privately held software development firm with operations in the us and china 
hanna strategies has been one of our software developers since fiscal our relationship with hanna strategies is intended to provide more efficient resources for the development of new products and the maintenance and enhancement of existing product offerings  among other things 
as of january   hanna strategies employed approximately  software developers primarily in china 
expenditures attributable to development work contracted from hanna strategies represented  and of our total research and development expenses for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the majority of our basic research and product development is performed in the us and canada  and to a growing extent in china 
our china application development center develops products for the worldwide market as well as products to specifically address the chinese market 
translation and localization of foreign market versions  as well as some product development  is performed by development teams or contractors in other local markets  particularly in our singapore and switzerland offices 
we generally translate and localize our products into french  italian  german  spanish  japanese and various chinese dialects 
we plan to increase our product development operations internationally over the next several years 
we believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development and lower costs 
however  international development  whether conducted by us or independent 
table of contents developers on our behalf  involves significant costs and challenges  including whether we can adequately protect our intellectual property and derive significant revenue in areas such as emerging economies where software piracy is a substantial problem 
the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware  operating systems and software  as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences 
to keep pace with these changes  we maintain an aggressive program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products 
we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies 
however  these investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or our competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers  either of which would likely adversely affect our competitive position 
our software products are complex and  despite extensive testing and quality control  may contain errors or defects 
these defects or errors could result in corrective releases to our software products  damage to our reputation  loss of revenues  an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products  any of which would likely harm our business 
we actively recruit and hire experienced software developers and license and acquire complementary software technologies and businesses 
in addition  we actively collaborate with and support third party software developers who offer products that enhance and complement our products 
independent firms and contractors perform some of our product development activities 
because talented development personnel are in high demand  these independent firms and contractors may not be able to provide development support to us in the future 
in addition  we license some technology from third parties 
use of this licensed technology may be restricted in ways that negatively affect our business in the future 
we may not be able to obtain and renew existing license agreements on favorable terms  if at all  and any failure to do so would likely harm our business 
in addition  our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with a network of third party developers who develop their own products that expand the functionality of our software 
some third party developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn 
these disruptions could negatively impact these third party developers and  in turn  end users  which could harm our business 
marketing and sales we sell our products and services in over countries primarily through an indirect channel consisting of distributors and resellers 
to a lesser extent we also sell directly to customers who are primarily large corporations 
our indirect channel model includes both a two tiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a one tiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers 
we have a network of approximately  resellers and distributors worldwide 
in addition  over  developers in the autodesk developer network create interoperable products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers 
for fiscal  approximately of our revenues were derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenues will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future 
one distributor  tech data corporation and its affiliates  accounted for  and of our net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
our customer related operations are divided into three geographic regions  the americas  europe middle east africa emea and asia pacific  and are supported by global marketing and sales organizations 
these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and international sales offices 

table of contents we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations  computer manufacturers  other software developers and peripheral manufacturers in cooperative advertising  promotions and trade show presentations 
we employ mass marketing techniques such as web casts  seminars  telemarketing  direct mailings and advertising in business and trade journals 
we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created on line user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 
our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks 
computer software resellers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future 
while we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of dealers and distributors prior to selling to them  if their financial condition were to deteriorate they might not be able to make repeat purchases 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in  business with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business 
our reliance on distributors and resellers subjects us to other risks  see item a  risk factors  for further discussion 
we intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages 
we believe that international sales will continue to comprise a significant portion of our net revenues 
economic weakness in any of the countries where we generate a significant portion of our net revenues could have an adverse effect on our business in those countries 
a summary of our financial information by geographic location is found in note  segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
customer and reseller support we provide technical support and training to customers through a leveraged support model  augmented by programs designed to address certain specific needs directly 
end users rely primarily on their resellers and distributors for technical support  however  we do provide certain direct support for our high end media and entertainment segment hardware systems 
we support the resellers and distributors through technical product training  sales training classes  the internet and direct telephone support 
we also provide optional online support directly to end users through our subscription program and support content is also available on the product support portion of our internet site 
there are also a number of user group forums in which customers are able to share information 
educational programs we offer education programs and specially priced software purchasing options tailored for educational institutions  students  and faculty to train the next generation of users 
we also offer classroom support  including standardized curricula developed by educators  instructor development  and a rich assortment of online learning resources 
users trained on autodesk products are broadly available both from universities and the existing workforce  reducing the cost of training for our customers 
developer programs one of our key strategies is to maintain an open architecture design of our software products to facilitate third party development of complementary products and industry specific software solutions 
this approach enables customers and third parties to customize our products for a wide variety of highly specific uses 
we offer several programs that provide marketing  sales  technical support and programming tools to developers who develop add on applications for our products 
backlog we typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order  which is common in the software industry 
our aggregate backlog is primarily comprised of deferred revenue 
deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred 
table of contents maintenance revenue from our subscription program 
to a lesser extent  deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from autodesk buzzsaw services  consulting services and deferred license sales 
backlog also includes current software license product orders which have not yet shipped 
the category of current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders from customers with approved credit status for currently available license software products and may include both orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 
aggregate backlog was million at january   of which million was deferred revenue and million related to current software license product orders which had not yet shipped at the end of the fiscal year 
aggregate backlog was million at january   of which million was deferred revenue and million related to current software license product orders which had not yet shipped 
deferred revenue increased over the prior year primarily due to an increase in deferred maintenance revenue resulting from the success of our subscription program  and we expect the increase in deferred maintenance revenue to continue to increase in the future 
we do not believe that aggregate backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of future results 
competition the markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid change 
in addition  in each of our markets  we compete with numerous regional and specialized software and services companies 
our design solutions segment competes with vendors that specialize primarily in one of the three industry segments in which we compete 
our competitors range from large  global  publicly traded software companies to small  geographically focused firms 
our primary global competitors in this segment include adobe systems inc  dassault systemes and its subsidiary solidworks corporation  google inc  environmental systems research institute  inc esri  intergraph corporation  nemetschek ag  parametric technology corporation  and ugs plm software  a global division of the siemens ag  and bentley systems  inc our media and entertainment segment competes with a wide range of different companies from large publicly traded corporations to small private entities 
large organizations that produce products that compete in some or all of our markets include avid technology  adobe systems inc  apple computer inc  sony and thomson 
the media and entertainment market is highly fragmented with complex interdependencies between many of the larger corporations 
as a result  some of our competitors also own subsidiaries that are our clients or our partners in developing or bringing to market some of our solutions 
the software industry has limited barriers to entry  and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding performance capacity at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry 
the design software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete  both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies 
because of these and other factors  competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced net revenues and profit margins and loss of market share  any of which could harm our business 
furthermore  in certain markets  some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and other resources 
we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer new products and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use  reliability  performance  range of useful features  continuing product enhancements  reputation  price and training 
intellectual property and licenses we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions 
nonetheless  our intellectual property rights may 
table of contents not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
enforcement of intellectual property rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims 
our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 
from time to time  we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party s intellectual property rights  including patents 
disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to  among other things  costly litigation or product shipment delays  which could harm our business 
we retain ownership of software we develop 
all software is licensed to users and provided in object code pursuant to either shrink wrap  embedded or on line licenses  or signed license agreements 
these agreements contain restrictions on duplication  disclosure and transfer 
we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid  ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries  we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to maintain and enhance our competitive market position 
while we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products  we are unable to measure the full extent to which piracy of our software products exists 
we believe  however  that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem 
production and suppliers production of our design solutions segment and certain media and entertainment segment software products involves duplication of the software media and the printing of user manuals 
the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors 
media for our products include cd roms which are available from multiple sources 
user manuals for our products and packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources 
production is either performed in leased facilities operated by us or by independent third party contractors 
to date  we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation 
in addition  the advanced systems business line has historically relied on third party vendors for the supply of hardware components used in its systems 
in the past  many of the advanced systems software products ran on workstations manufactured by silicon graphics  inc sgi 
during fiscal  the majority of our advanced systems product revenues migrated to standard  open  pc based linux platforms and away from the sgi platform 
we still generate some revenues from sgi hardware platforms and there is a risk that we may not be able to migrate all customer orders to linux based systems 
see item a  risk factors  for further discussion of this risk 
employees as of january   we employed  people 
none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union  however  in certain foreign countries  our employees are represented by work councils 
we have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good 
reliance upon employees in other countries entails various risks that possible government instability or regulation unfavorable to foreign owned businesses could negatively impact our business in the future 
competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry  especially highly skilled engineers  is intense 
we believe our continued growth and future success is highly dependent on our continued ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees

we cannot predict the outcome of the sec investigation 
if we or any of our current or former officers or directors is subject to an adverse finding resulting from the sec investigation  we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us which could adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial position  cash flows and the trading price of our securities 
in addition  if the informal investigation continues for a prolonged period of time  this could have the same effects  regardless of the outcome of the investigation 
we have been named as a party in lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related accounting  and we may be named in additional litigation in the future  all of which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and the trading price for our securities 
at least three lawsuits have been filed against us and our current directors and officers and certain of our former directors and officers relating to our historical stock option practices and related accounting 
see item  legal proceedings for a more detailed description of these proceedings 
these actions are in the preliminary stages  and the ultimate outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and the trading price for our securities 
we may become the subject of additional private or government actions regarding these matters in the future  including shareholder or employee litigation 
litigation may be time consuming  expensive and disruptive to normal business operations  and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict 
the defense of these lawsuits will result in significant expenditures and the continued diversion of our management s time and attention from the operation of our business  which could impede our business 
all or a portion of any amount we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment or settlement of any or all of these claims may not be covered by insurance 
if we do not maintain compliance with the listing requirements of the nasdaq global select market  our common stock could be delisted  which could  among other things  reduce the price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders 
in connection with the voluntary review and the restatement of our financial statements  we were delinquent in filing certain of our periodic filings with the sec  and consequently we were not in compliance with the listing requirements under the nasdaq global select market s marketplace rules 
as a result  we underwent an extensive review and hearing process with the nasdaq global select market to determine our listing status 
the nasdaq global select market ultimately permitted our securities to remain listed  however  our securities could be delisted in the future if we do not maintain compliance with applicable listing requirements 
if our securities are delisted from the nasdaq global select market  they would subsequently be transferred to the national quotation service bureau  or pink sheets 
the trading of our common stock on the pink sheets may 
table of contents reduce the price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders 
in addition  the trading of our common stock on the pink sheets would materially adversely affect our access to the capital markets and our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us or at all 
securities that trade on the pink sheets are no longer eligible for margin loans  and a company trading on the pink sheets cannot avail itself of federal preemption of state securities or blue sky laws  which adds substantial compliance costs to securities issuances  including pursuant to employee option plans  stock purchase plans and private or public offerings of securities 
if we are delisted in the future from the nasdaq global select market and transferred to the pink sheets  there may also be other negative implications  including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers  customers and employees and the loss of institutional investor interest in our company 
because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from autocad based software products  if these products are not successful  our net revenues will be adversely affected 
we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from sales of autocad software  including products based on autocad that serve specific vertical markets  upgrades to those products and products that are interoperable with autocad 
as such  any factor adversely affecting sales of these products  including the product release cycle  market acceptance  product competition  performance and reliability  reputation  price competition  economic and market conditions and the availability of third party applications  would likely harm our operating results 
changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices  or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 
changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices  new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules  or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business 
further  such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective 
in particular  for fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r which requires us to record stock based compensation charges to earnings for employee stock option grants using a fair value based method for determining such charges 
we believe that the adoption of sfas r will continue to materially adversely impact our earnings and may impact the manner in which we conduct our business 
our international operations expose us to significant regulatory  intellectual property  collections  exchange fluctuations  taxation and other risks  which could adversely impact our future net revenues and increase our net expenses 
we anticipate that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues and will provide significant support to our overall development efforts 
risks inherent in our international operations include the following the impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business  unexpected changes in regulatory practices and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations  longer collection cycles for accounts receivable  potential changes in tax laws  tax arrangements with foreign governments and laws regarding the management of data  possible future limitations upon foreign owned businesses  and greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property 
our international results will also continue to be impacted by economic and political conditions in foreign markets generally and in specific large foreign markets  especially by changes in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies 
these factors may adversely impact our future international operations and consequently our business as a whole 
our risk management strategy uses derivative financial instruments  in the form of foreign currency forward and option contracts  for the purpose of hedging foreign currency market exposures during each quarter which 
table of contents exist as a part of our ongoing business operations 
these instruments provide us some protection against currency exposures for only the current quarter 
significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currency markets may adversely impact our future net revenues 
while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting  we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of section  we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting 
the report contains  among other matters  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
the report must also contain a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on management s assessment of such internal controls 
while we have determined in our management report on internal control over financial reporting included in this annual report on form k that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january   we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting 
if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and such weakness remains uncorrected at fiscal year end  we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective at fiscal year end 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at fiscal year end or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest that our management s report is fairly stated or they are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which would likely have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 
as a result of the voluntary review of autodesk s historical stock option grant practices  our management identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting in periods ending prior to march for the period between july and february  autodesk generally followed an administrative process for monthly broad based employee grants that resulted in the selection of effective grant dates that were prior in time to the final preparation of action by written consent for such grants 
since march  we have implemented a number of changes that will resolve past measurement date errors and deter them from happening in the future 
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 
as more and more software patents are granted worldwide  as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and as the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps  we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims 
infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been  and may in the future be  asserted against us  and any such assertions could harm our business 
additionally  certain patent holders without products  like z technologies  have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents 
any such claims or threats  whether with or without merit  have been and could in the future be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation and diversion of resources  or could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
in addition  such royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  which would likely harm our business 

table of contents our business could suffer as a result of risks associated with strategic acquisitions and investments such as the acquisitions of alias and constructware and investment in hanna strategies 
we periodically acquire or invest in businesses  software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through strategic alliances  equity investments or acquisitions 
for example  we recently completed the acquisitions of alias systems holdings  inc and constructware and acquired a ownership in hanna strategies 
the risks associated with such acquisitions include  among others  the difficulty of assimilating the products  operations and personnel of the companies  the failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections  the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section  and the diversion of management s time and attention 
in addition  such investments and acquisitions may involve significant transaction or integration related costs 
we may not be successful in overcoming such risks  and such investments and acquisitions may negatively impact our business 
in addition  such investments and acquisitions have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
the fluctuations could arise from transaction related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments 
these costs or charges  including those relating to the alias or constructware acquisitions or investment in hanna strategies  could negatively impact results of operations for a given period or cause quarter to quarter variability in our operating results 
if silicon graphics  inc sgi  which recently emerged from chapter bankruptcy protection  fails to deliver products  provide product upgrades or provide product support  the business relating to our advanced systems products of our media and entertainment segment will be adversely affected 
in the media and entertainment segment  our customers buying patterns are heavily influenced by advertising and entertainment industry cycles  which have resulted in and could have a negative impact on our operating results 
in addition  a reducing but significant percentage of the media and entertainment segment s advanced systems products rely primarily on workstations manufactured by sgi 
on may   sgi announced that it has filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in us bankruptcy court  and on october  sgi emerged from chapter bankruptcy protection 
in addition  sgi has changed its management team and is refocusing its business 
significantly  sgi has recently announced its intention to cease development of new products for the media and entertainment industry 
although we have reduced our dependence on sgi workstations for the advanced systems products and will continue to do so in the future  the near term failure of sgi to deliver products  product upgrades or product support in a timely manner would likely result in an adverse effect upon our financial results for a given period 
although we offer a range of media and entertainment segment products for use on standard  open  pc based linux platforms  our customers may not choose to adopt our products using these alternative platforms  or may delay purchases while evaluating the new platforms  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period 
our operating results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenues and operating results difficult to predict 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the timing of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  slowing of momentum in upgrade or maintenance revenue  the adoption of sfas r  which required us to record compensation expense for shares issued under our stock plans beginning in the first quarter of fiscal with a negative impact on our results of operations  continued fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates  failure to achieve anticipated levels of customer acceptance of key new applications  unexpected costs or changes in marketing or other operating expenses  changes in product pricing or product mix  platform changes  failure to convert our d customer base to d products  delays in product releases  timing of product releases and retirements  failure to continue momentum of annual release cycles or to move a significant number of customers 
table of contents from prior product versions in connection with our programs to retire major products  unexpected outcomes of matters relating to litigation  failure to achieve continued cost reductions and productivity increases  unanticipated changes in tax rates and tax laws  distribution channel management  changes in sales compensation practices  the timing of large systems sales  failure to effectively implement our copyright legalization programs  especially in developing countries  failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies  failure to achieve sufficient sell through in our channels for new or existing products  the financial and business condition of our reseller and distribution channels  renegotiation or termination of royalty or intellectual property arrangements  interruptions or terminations in the business of our consultants or third party developers  failure to grow lifecycle management or collaboration products  unanticipated impact of accounting for technology acquisitions and general economic conditions  particularly in countries where we derive a significant portion of our net revenues 
we have also experienced fluctuations in operating results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic conditions 
in particular  our operating results in europe during the third quarter are usually affected by a slow summer period  and the asia pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in the third and fourth quarters 
our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability 
failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would negatively affect future profitability 
further  gross margins may be adversely affected if our sales of autocad lt  upgrades and advanced systems products  which historically have had lower margins  grow at a faster rate than sales of our higher margin products 
existing and increased competition may reduce our net revenues and profits 
the software industry has limited barriers to entry  and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition  both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies 
in addition  some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and other resources 
furthermore  a reduction in the number and availability of compatible third party applications may adversely affect the sale of our products 
because of these and other factors  competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future 
increased competition could result in continued price reductions  reduced net revenues and profit margins and loss of market share  any of which would likely harm our business 
we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer products that compete favorably with respect to reliability  performance  ease of use  range of useful features  continuing product enhancements  reputation and price 
net revenues or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline 
the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including the following net revenues or earnings shortfalls  unexpected deviations in results of key performance metrics  and changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations  developments in our industry  unusual events such as significant acquisitions  divestitures and litigation  and general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 

table of contents historically  after periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation 
this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources 
our efforts to develop and introduce new products and service offerings expose us to risks such as limited customer acceptance  costs related to product defects and large expenditures that may not result in additional net revenues 
rapid technological changes  as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences  characterize the software industry 
we are devoting significant resources to the development of technologies  like our lifecycle management initiatives  and service offerings to address demands in the marketplace for increased connectivity and use of digital data created by computer aided design software 
as a result  we are introducing new business models  requiring a considerable investment of technical and financial resources 
such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs  or competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers  adversely affecting our competitive position 
in particular  a critical component of our growth strategy is to convert our d customer base  including customers of autocad  autocad lt  and related vertical industry products  to our d products such as autodesk inventor family of products or autodesk revit family of products 
should sales of autocad  autocad upgrades and autocad lt products decrease without a corresponding conversion of customer seats to d products  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
product development may also be outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions 
such externally developed technologies have certain additional risks  including potential difficulties with effective integration into existing products  adequate transfer of technology know how and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property 
for example  in april  we acquired a ownership in hanna strategies  a privately held software development firm that has been one of our software developers since expenditures attributable to development work contracted from hanna strategies represented  and of our total research and development expenses for fiscal years  and  respectively 
additionally  the software products we offer are complex  and despite extensive testing and quality control  may contain errors or defects 
these defects or errors could result in the need for corrective releases to our software products  damage to our reputation  loss of revenues  an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products  any of which would likely harm our business 
we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies  our product and service development may be delayed 
we rely on certain software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  and the software may not be appropriately supported  maintained or enhanced by the licensors 
the loss of licenses to  or inability to support  maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs  or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software could be developed  identified  licensed and integrated  which would likely harm our business 
we are investing resources in updating and improving our internal information technology systems 
should our investments not succeed  or if delays or other issues with a new internal technology system disrupt our operations  our business would be harmed 
we rely on our network infrastructure  internal technology systems and our websites for our development  marketing  operational  support and sales activities 
we are continually investing resources to update and 
table of contents improve these systems in order to meet the growing requirements of our business and customers 
unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations  loss of revenues or damage to our reputation 
disruptions with licensing relationships and third party developers could adversely impact our business 
we license certain key technologies from third parties 
licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business 
similarly  we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms  if at all  and any failure to do so could harm our business 
our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with third party developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software 
some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn 
in particular markets  this disruption would likely negatively impact these third party developers and end users  which could harm our business 
as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development  our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 
we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities 
we believe our partnering strategy allows us to  among other things  achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings 
in addition  we have acquired an investment interest in one developer  hanna strategies 
we have historically and plan to continue to contract with hanna strategies in order to provide more efficient resources for the development of new products and features in existing products 
however  our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers 
independent developers  including those who currently develop products for us in the united states and throughout the world  may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future 
in addition  use of development resources through consulting relationships  particularly in non us jurisdictions with developing legal systems  may be adversely impacted by  and expose us to risks relating to  evolving employment  export and intellectual property laws 
these risks could  among other things  expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules 
general economic conditions may affect our net revenues and harm our business 
as our business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic and political conditions 
if economic growth in the united states and other countries economies is slowed  many customers may delay or reduce technology purchases 
this could result in reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles  slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition 
in addition  weakness in the end user market could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could  in turn  delay paying their obligations to us  which would increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenues on future sales to these customers 
any of these events would likely harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we do not maintain our relationships with the members of our distribution channel  or achieve anticipated levels of sell through  our ability to generate net revenues will be adversely affected 
we sell our software products both directly to customers and through a network of distributors and resellers 
our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our reseller network 
computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have 
table of contents previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future 
while we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of dealers and distributors prior to our sales to them  if their financial condition were to deteriorate  they might not be able to make repeat purchases 
we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions  including tech data corporation and their affiliates  who accounted for of fiscal net revenues and of fiscal net revenues 
the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers or the failure to achieve anticipated levels of sell through with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business 
in particular  if one or more of such resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us  we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenues on future sales to these customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period 
product returns could exceed our estimates and harm our net revenues 
we permit our distributors and resellers to return to of prior quarter purchases and to return a product when new product releases supersede older versions 
consistent with our experience in fiscal  we anticipate that product returns will continue to be driven by product update cycles  new product releases and software quality 
we establish reserves for stock balancing and product rotation 
these reserves are based on historical experience  estimated channel inventory levels and the timing of new product introductions and other factors 
while we maintain strict measures to monitor these reserves  actual product returns may exceed our reserve estimates  and such differences could harm our business 
if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights  our business could be harmed 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our software products is time consuming and costly 
while we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products  we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
furthermore  our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate  and our competitors may independently develop similar technology 
item b 
unresolved staff comments we have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the sec that were issued days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year that remain unresolved 
item properties we lease  square feet of office space in locations in the united states and internationally through our foreign subsidiaries 
our executive offices and corporate headquarters are located in leased office space in san rafael  california 
our san rafael facilities consist of  square feet under leases that have expiration dates ranging from october to february we and our foreign subsidiaries lease additional space in various locations throughout the world for local sales  product development and technical support personnel

restatement of previously issued financial results introduction on august   autodesk  inc autodesk or the company announced that the audit committee of the board of directors was conducting a voluntary review of autodesk s historical stock option granting practices and related accounting issues 
on february   autodesk announced the key results of the voluntary review  which were set forth in the form k filed on that date 
the audit committee engaged independent outside legal counsel  hogan hartson llp  who  with the assistance of forensic accounting experts  pricewaterhousecoopers  reviewed the facts and circumstances surrounding approximately separate stock option grant approvals made between january and august  or the relevant period 
during the course of the voluntary review  more than  documents were reviewed and interviews with over current and former employees  directors and advisors were conducted 
in february  the audit committee completed its review and presented its final report to autodesk s board of directors 
the following is a summary of the key findings of the audit committee throughout the relevant period  numerous administrative errors were made in the processing of option grants resulting in options being accounted for incorrectly  between july and february  the company made monthly broad based employee grants pursuant to authority delegated by the board to the ceo  where the grant dates for most of these broad based grants were selected by an administrative process to coincide with low trading prices during the month of the applicable grant  during the calendar year a broad based employee grant that included a grant to the company s then cfo and then general counsel were measured on an incorrect date  and the new hire grant to the then incoming ceo was measured on an incorrect date  there was no evidence that any officer or director backdated any stock option granted to himself or herself  based on the evidence developed during the review  the audit committee concluded that it was unlikely that those involved in the decisions and actions that resulted in measurement date errors understood the accounting impact of their actions or that they intended to misstate our financial statements  and 
table of contents there was no evidence of any measurement date error involving any stock option grant made to a person serving as a director 
the company had progressively  substantially and voluntarily improved its employee stock based compensation grant process prior to  before the intense regulatory and media focus on stock option grant practices began  and no company employees or officers who may have made discretionary determinations that resulted in measurement date errors in the past has any continuing role relating to the distribution  administration or accounting for stock based compensation 
as a result of the findings of the voluntary review  the board of directors has concluded  upon the recommendation of management and the audit committee  that the consolidated balance sheets as of january     and  and the related consolidated statements of income  stockholders equity  and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended january    and  should no longer be relied upon 
as a result  we are restating our previously issued financial statements for fiscal years through  inclusive  to correct errors related to accounting for total stock based compensation expense 
the pre tax  non cash charges to be restated are an aggregate million for stock based compensation expense over the year period of the review through fiscal approximately million of the restated amounts apply to the income statements for fiscal years through  inclusive  and the remainder  which is applicable to prior fiscal years  has been recorded as a charge to retained earnings as of january  such charges have the effect of decreasing net income and  correspondingly  retained earnings as reported in our historical financial statements 
the net of tax impact of the stock based compensation adjustments in the first quarter of fiscal were insignificant 
however  we restated our consolidated balance sheet as of january  to properly reflect retained earnings  common stock and deferred compensation balances as a result of previous period adjustments 
during the period of the voluntary stock option review  we determined that we incorrectly recorded certain credits to resellers 
as a result  adjustments were made to increase net revenues and decrease deferred revenue by million in fiscal and million in fiscal these adjustments  which have the effect of increasing net income and  correspondingly  retained earnings  are described in more detail below 
this form k reflects the restatement of our consolidated balance sheet as of january   the related consolidated statements of income  stockholders equity  and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended january  and  and each of the quarters in fiscal this form k also reflects the restatement of selected consolidated financial data in item for the fiscal years ended january    and  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item for the fiscal years ended january  and previously filed annual reports on form k and quarterly reports on form q prior to fiscal have been affected by the restatements  have not been amended  and should not be relied on 
in connection with the restatement of our consolidated financial statements  we applied judgment in determining whether to revise measurement dates for prior option grants 
in addition  if we determined that a measurement date needed to be revised  judgment was applied in determining the appropriate measurement date 
in addition  we have restated the pro forma expense under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas in part ii  item  note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements to include these adjustments for the years ended january  and all references to the number of option shares  option exercise prices  and share prices in this section have been adjusted for any subsequent stock splits 

table of contents stock option grant process pursuant to our non director stock plans  our board of directors has the authority to grant options or delegate this authority to a committee 
for portions of the relevant period  the right to grant options under our stock plans to all employees other than non employee directors was delegated to the compensation committee of the board of directors or to the chief executive officer  or ceo  as a committee of one 
executive officer option grants were generally approved by the compensation committee during regularly scheduled compensation committee meetings  although a small number were approved by unanimous written consent 
option grants by the ceo to all other employees were generally done on a monthly basis by written consent during the period between december and august accounting adjustments consistent with the applicable accounting literature and recent guidance from the sec staff  we organized the separate stock option grant approvals  totaling approximately  individual grants  made during the relevant period into categories based on grant type and the processes by which the grant approval was finalized 
we analyzed the evidence from the audit committee s review related to each category including  but not limited to  physical documents  electronic documents  underlying electronic data about documents  and witness interviews 
based on the relevant facts and circumstances  we applied the then appropriate accounting standards to determine  for every grant within each category  the proper measurement date 
if the measurement date was not the originally assigned grant date  accounting adjustments were made as required  resulting in stock based compensation expense and related tax effects 
after accounting for forfeitures  we recognized stock based compensation expense of million on a pre tax basis over the vesting terms for the affected grants 
no adjustments were required for the remaining grants 
the adjustments were determined by category as follows monthly date selection process grants for the period between july and february  we generally followed an administrative process for monthly broad based employee grants that resulted in the selection of effective grant dates that were prior in time to the final preparation of action by written consent for such grants the monthly date selection process grants 
usually  the grant dates selected by this process were chosen later in the same calendar month in which the applicable actions by written consent were signed and were dates prior in time to the final preparation of such written consents to coincide with low trading prices during the month of the applicable grant 
based on the voluntary review  the company determined that the measurement dates for approximately  individual grants of the approximate total  individual grants made to broad based employees pursuant to delegated authority must be revised because the grant dates selected by the administrative process were prior in time to the final approval of such grants 
for these grants  based upon the available evidence we chose as the measurement date the date upon which the terms of the specific monthly broad based employee grant was determined to be fixed and unchangeable 
accordingly  we recognized a pre tax stock based compensation expense of million for such grant approvals using the intrinsic value method of accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb 
new hire grant to incoming ceo in may  the compensation committee approved a grant to the company s then incoming ceo that was measured on an incorrect date 
the measurement date used was april   the date the company and the incoming ceo had reached a business agreement on most of the terms of her employment agreement  including the number of stock options to be granted 
however  discussions thereafter continued regarding other important matters  including the structure of  and exercise price for  her stock option grant 
the essential terms of the option grant  the grant price  number of options and date of grant  were presented to the board on april   and approved by the compensation committee on may  in connection with the grant to the then incoming ceo  both parties were represented by counsel 
we recognized pre tax stock based compensation expense of million from this grant based on a revised measurement date of may  using the intrinsic value method of accounting under apb anomalous add grants based on the voluntary review  the audit committee found that in certain instances  additions or error corrections were made to the details of grants that had already been approved by the 
table of contents ceo without obtaining additional approval the anomalous add grants 
for the period between december through august when the ceo had delegated authority to grant options  of approximately  individual option grants were considered to be anomalous add grants  for a total error rate of  with of anomalous add grants occurring prior to fiscal based on the voluntary review  management determined that the measurement dates for the related individual option grants must be revised 
accordingly  we recognized pre tax stock based compensation expense of million from such grants using the intrinsic value method of accounting under apb termination issues during the relevant period  two former executives and employees were permitted to vest in and subsequently exercise stock options to purchase an aggregate of approximately million shares of common stock for a period of time beyond what they were otherwise entitled to exercise under their original stock option agreement 
in most cases  vesting was extended for a period of time after the termination date and  thus  should have resulted in accounting consequences 
for the employees  it appears that these cases were most likely due to administrative error 
based on the voluntary review  management determined that the accounting for the related option grants must be revised and we recognized pre tax stock based compensation expense of million from such grants using the intrinsic value method of accounting under apb board authorized grant in  the board approved a broad based employee grant  which included a grant to the company s then cfo and then general counsel  that involved a measurement date error 
the error was caused by the company s use of the date on which the board approved the general scope and nature of a special one time grant to certain employees as the measurement date  rather than the date on which the specific grantees and grant amounts were finalized and approved by the board 
in addition  in  the board approved a broad based employee grant with an exercise price less than the fair market value on the date of grant 
accordingly  we recognized pre tax stock based compensation expense of million from these grants 
compensation committee grants from through i two individual option grants do not appear to have any evidence of compensation committee approval or authorization  ii four additional individual option grants appear to have been ratified at a date subsequent to the original grant date  and iii the original measurement date of one additional option grant approved by a unanimous written consent of the compensation committee appears to have been made more than a reasonable period of time prior to final approval of the grant for accounting purposes 
based on the voluntary review  management determined that the measurement dates for the related option grants must be revised 
accordingly  we recognized pre tax stock based compensation expense of million from seven grants 
judgment in light of the judgment used in establishing revised measurement dates  alternate approaches to those used by us could have resulted in different compensation expense charges than those recorded by us in the restatement 
we considered various alternative approaches 
for monthly date selection process grants  where for certain of the grants  there was no evidence to suggest a particular single date was the appropriate measurement date  company management narrowed the possible measurement date to a range of dates or a grant window 
the grant window was approximately four days on average and ranged from one day to sixteen days 
the company s management considered which date to use in this range and chose to use the last day of the grant window since the grants appeared to be fixed and unchangeable 
we believe the grant was fixed and unchangeable on the last day in the grant window because this was the day the award was communicated 
changing the measurement dates from the last day of the grant window to the highest price during the grant window would cause the pre tax compensation charges discussed above to increase by approximately million 
changing the measurement dates from the last day of the grant window to the lowest price during the grant window would cause the pre tax compensation charges discussed above to decrease by approximately million 

table of contents for the anomalous add grants  company management determined that the measurement date was the date the individual grant was fixed and unchangeable 
this was the date by which the award was likely communicated to the employee 
alternatively  we considered the date on which the employee and relevant grant information were added to the grant list 
however  because that date did not necessarily represent a date that the award was either approved or communicated to the employee  we rejected that alternative 
we believe the grant was fixed and unchangeable on the last day in the grant window because this was the day the award was communicated 
changing the measurement dates for the anomalous add grants from the date upon which the terms of the grant were likely communicated to the employee to the date when the grant information was likely added to the grant list would cause the pre tax compensation charges discussed above to decrease by approximately million 
changing the measurement dates for the anomalous add grants from the date upon which the terms of the award were likely communicated to the employee to the highest price in the grant window would cause the pre tax compensation charges to increase by approximately million 
we believe that the approaches we used for each of the categories were the most appropriate under the circumstances 
financial impact of the restatement the increase in net revenues and stock based compensation expense resulting from the restatement is as follows in millions fiscal year net revenues stock based compensation expense tax effect total adjustments  net of tax total impact total includes million of payroll tax expenses 
the net of tax impact of the stock based compensation adjustments in the first quarter of fiscal was insignificant 
however  we restated our consolidated balance sheet as of january  to properly reflect retained earnings  common stock and deferred compensation balances as a result of previous period adjustments 
please refer to note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also restated the pro forma expense under sfas in note business and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k to reflect the impact of these adjustments for the years ended january  and 
table of contents as mentioned above  while performing the voluntary stock option review  we identified that we incorrectly recorded certain credits to resellers 
certain credits to resellers for sales of new and renewal maintenance were recognized as a reduction of license and other revenues and maintenance revenues in the period the transaction was billed 
these credits should have been recorded as a reduction of deferred maintenance revenue when the transaction was billed which would have resulted in a reduction to maintenance revenues over the maintenance period 
the impact of this restatement resulted in adjustments to increase net revenues and decrease deferred revenues of million in fiscal and million in fiscal for more information regarding our restated financial statements  see financial statements and supplementary data in
