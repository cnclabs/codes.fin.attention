item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in item of part ii of this form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the research  development  and commercialization of drugs for life threatening diseases  such as malignant mesothelioma and other cancers 
our corporate strategy is to become a leader in the discovery  development  and commercialization of novel ribonuclease rnase therapeutics for cancer and other life threatening diseases 
we are a development stage company as defined in the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by development stage enterprises 
we are devoting substantially all of our present efforts to establishing a new business and developing new drug products 
our planned principal operations of marketing and or licensing new drugs have not commenced and  accordingly  we have not derived any significant revenue from these operations 
since our inception in  we have devoted the vast majority of our resources to the research and development of onconase  our lead drug candidate  as well as other related drug candidates 
in recent years we have focused our resources towards the completion of the clinical program for onconase in patients suffering from unresectable  or inoperable  malignant mesothelioma umm 
we have incurred losses since inception and we have not received food and drug administration fda approval of any of our drug candidates 
we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our research and development activities  which include the sponsorship of human clinical trials for our drug candidates 
until we are able to consistently generate revenue through the sale of drug or non drug products  we anticipate that we will be required to fund the development of our pre clinical compounds and drug product candidates primarily by other means  including  but not limited to  licensing the development or marketing rights to some of our drug candidates to third parties  collaborating with third parties to develop our drug candidates  or selling company issued securities 
during our fiscal year ended july   management s efforts were primarily focused on our confirmatory continued preparations for a potential onconase new drug application nda to be submitted to the fda upon completion of our confirmatory phase iiib clinical trial which is expected to occur prior to the end of  and our submission of various components of the nda to the fda as they are completed  which began in february changes to our executive team in included the appointment of lawrence a 
kenyon as our executive vice president  chief financial officer and corporate secretary in january 
mr 
kenyon replaced mr 
robert d 
love who served as chief financial officer from may until his retirement in january additionally  in management spent significant time attending to commercial matters primarily associated with the continued development of relationships with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that have expressed an interest in assisting us in the potential marketing and distribution of onconase in the event that our clinical trial results lead to approval of our nda by the fda  and making preparations for the planned phase ii clinical trials of onconase in patients suffering from cancers other than umm which are currently anticipated to begin later in during fiscal year we entered into our first two commercial agreements for onconase 
in december we entered into a distribution and marketing agreement with genesis pharma sa genesis  pursuant to which genesis was granted exclusive rights for the marketing  sales  and distribution of onconase for use in oncology in greece  cyprus  bulgaria  romania  slovenia  croatia  serbia  and the former yugoslavian republic of macedonia  that entitles us to receive milestone payments based on the achievement of certain regulatory approvals and certain sales goals 
in addition  we will receive a royalty on net sales as well as a transfer price for product sold by us to genesis 
in july  we entered into a distribution and marketing agreement with usp pharma spolka zoo  an affiliate of zoo pharmacia  for the exclusive marketing  sales  and distribution rights for use of onconase in oncology in poland  belarus  ukraine  estonia  latvia  and lithuania 
under the terms of this agreement  we received a total of million  which includes an upfront payment of  and a million equity investment in our company 
we will also be entitled to receive milestone payments based on the achievement of certain regulatory approvals and certain sales goals  and a royalty on net sales as well as a transfer price for product sold by us to us pharmacia 
in january  onconase was granted orphan drug designation by the fda 
orphan drug designation permits us to be awarded seven years of marketing exclusivity for onconase for the malignant mesothelioma indication upon fda approval for this indication 
other benefits for which we are eligible with the orphan drug designation include protocol assistance by the fda in the preparation of a dossier that will meet regulatory requirements  tax credits  research and development grant funding  and reduced filing fees for the marketing application 
previously  our onconase development program received fast track designation from the fda for the treatment of malignant mesothelioma patients 
we continue to have discussions with the fda to establish mutually agreed upon parameters for the nda to obtain marketing approval for onconase  assuming the phase iiib clinical trial for the treatment of malignant mesothelioma yields favorable results 
we also have previously received an orphan medicinal product designation for onconase from the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products  or emea  as well as orphan drug designation for onconase for malignant mesothelioma in australia from the therapeutics goods administration  or tga 
orphan drug designation from these agencies provides benefits such as marketing exclusivity  reduced filing fees and regulatory guidance 
almost all of the million of research and development expenses we have incurred since our inception has gone toward the development of onconase and related drug candidates 
for the fiscal years  and  our research and development expenses were approximately million  million  and million  respectively  almost all of which were used for the development of onconase and related drug candidates 
onconase is currently in an international  centrally randomized  confirmatory phase iiib registration trial 
the primary endpoint of the trial is a statistically significant improvement in overall survival 
the first interim analysis results based on one third of the required events deaths of the study  which evaluates the efficacy  safety and tolerability of the combination of onconase doxorubicin as compared to doxorubicin alone  have been reported 
the median survival time mst demonstrated a trend favoring the onconase doxorubicin treatment group months over the doxorubicin group months 
a two month improvement in median survival had previously been observed in the treatment target group n analysis from a previously completed phase iii single agent study that favored onconase over doxorubicin treatments months vs 
months 
the company s phase iiib confirmatory registration trial was designed based on the conclusions drawn from the ttg analysis but powered to reach a statistically significant difference in overall survival between the onconase doxorubicin treatment group and the doxorubicin treatment group at evaluable events 
the interim data  which represented only one third of the planned number of evaluable events  was sufficient for us to continue the trial as planned  but was not sufficient for supporting our filing for marketing approvals at that time 
at this time  we cannot predict with certainty when a sufficient number of deaths will occur to achieve statistical significance 
the timing of when we will be able to file for marketing registrations in the us  eu and australia is data driven 
therefore  we cannot predict with certainty what our total cost associated with obtaining marketing approvals will be  or when and if such approvals will be granted  or when actual sales will occur 
we are currently submitting the various components of the nda for onconase as they are completed  which began in february with our submission of the chemistry  manufacturing and controls cmc section  in anticipation of potentially achieving favorable results from the phase iiib trial 
we have reached evaluable events in the phase iiib clinical trial  and currently estimate that we will reach evaluable events  the point at which we can begin our statistical analysis of the clinical trial data  by the end of enrollment in the trial was completed in september we fund the research and development of our products primarily from cash receipts resulting from the sale of our equity securities and convertible debentures in registered offerings and private placements 
additionally  we have raised capital through other debt financings  the sale of our tax benefits and research products  interest income and financing received from our chief executive officer 
during the fiscal year ended july   we received net proceeds of approximately million as a result of private placements of common stock and from exercises of stock options and warrants 
these proceeds will be used primarily to complete our confirmatory phase iiib clinical trial and support our anticipated filing of an nda of onconase for malignant mesothelioma  assuming satisfactory results from the ongoing clinical trial 
we have incurred losses since inception and  to date  we have generated only small amounts of capital from marketing and distribution agreements for onconase 
results of operations fiscal year ended july   as compared to fiscal year ended july we are a development stage company as defined in the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
we are devoting substantially all our present efforts to establishing a new business and developing new drug products 
our planned principal operations of marketing of new drugs have not commenced and  accordingly  we have not derived any significant revenue from these operations 
we focus most of our productive and financial resources on the development of onconase 
we did not record any revenue in fiscal years or research and development expense for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of approximately million  or 
the increase primarily resulted from increased compensation expense related to employee salaries and benefits of approximately million mostly due to increased stock based compensation expenses in  in addition to an increase of approximately million in expenses incurred from our ongoing phase i ii onconase clinical trials that initiated in june and november these increased expenses were offset by decreased expenses of approximately million related to preparations for the completion of our phase iiib onconase clinical trial and the initiation of the related submissions of various sections of our rolling nda to the fda 
general and administrative expense for fiscal year was approximately million compared to approximately million for fiscal year  an increase of approximately million  or 
this increase was primarily due to increased compensation expense associated with employee salaries and benefits of approximately million related mostly to increased stock based compensation expenses  as well as increased investor relations expenses of approximately million resulting from our use of an investor relations firm beginning in fiscal year other general and administrative expenses  including legal  audit  consulting  travel and miscellaneous office expenses increased by a total of approximately million in investment income for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million 
the increase was due to higher balances of cash and cash equivalents on hand during the fiscal year as compared to the same period in new jersey has enacted legislation permitting certain corporations located in new jersey to sell a portion of its state tax loss carryforwards and state research and development credits in order to obtain tax benefits 
for the state fiscal year july  to june   we had approximately million of total available state tax benefits that qualified for sale  of which new jersey permitted us to sell approximately million 
in december  we received approximately million from the sale of these state tax benefits  which was recognized as state tax benefit in the fiscal year ended july  for the state fiscal year july  to june   we had approximately million of total available state tax benefits that were saleable  of which new jersey permitted us to sell approximately million 
in december  we received approximately million from the sale of these state tax benefits  which we recognized as state tax benefits for the fiscal year ended july  if still available under new jersey law  we will attempt to sell the remaining million of our state tax benefits between july  and june  state fiscal year 
this amount  which is a carryover of our remaining state tax benefits from state fiscal year and earlier  may increase if we incur additional state tax benefits during state fiscal year we cannot estimate  however  what percentage of our saleable state tax benefits new jersey will permit us to sell  how much money we will receive in connection with the sale  if we will be able to find a buyer for our state tax benefits or if such funds will be available in a timely manner 
we have incurred net losses during each year since our inception 
the net loss for fiscal year was approximately million as compared to million in fiscal year the increased net loss was primarily related to the increased general and administrative expenses in the cumulative loss from the date of inception  august   to july  amounted to million 
such losses are attributable to the fact that we are still in the development stage and  accordingly  have not derived sufficient revenues from operations to offset the development stage expenses 
fiscal year ended july   as compared to fiscal year ended july we did not record any revenue in fiscal years and research and development expense for fiscal year was approximately million compared to approximately million for fiscal year  an increase of approximately million  or 
the increase was primarily due to increased compensation expense of approximately which is primarily related to share based compensation 
this increase was offset by a decrease in patent expenses of approximately million and completion of key toxicology requirements and key requirements for chemistry  manufacturing and controls for our anticipated onconase nda resulting in a decrease in expenses of approximately million  and a decrease in pre clinical sponsored research and development expenses of approximately million 
general and administrative expense for fiscal year was approximately million compared to approximately million for fiscal year  an increase of approximately million  or 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense of approximately million which is primarily related to share based compensation 
the increase in general and administrative expense also resulted from increased legal fees of approximately million and increased compensation expense for consultants and board of director fees of approximately million  offset by decreases in other general and administrative expenses of approximately million 
investment income was approximately million for each of the fiscal years and new jersey has enacted legislation permitting certain corporations located in new jersey to sell a portion of its state tax loss carryforwards and state research and development credits in order to obtain tax benefits 
for the state fiscal year july  to june   we had approximately million of total available state tax benefits that were saleable  of which new jersey permitted us to sell approximately million 
in december  we received approximately million from the sale of these state tax benefits  which we recognized as state tax benefits for the fiscal year ended july  for the state fiscal year july  to june   we had approximately million total available state tax benefits that were saleable  of which new jersey permitted us to sell approximately million 
in december  we received approximately million from the sale of these state tax benefits  which we recognized as state tax benefits for the fiscal year ended july  the net loss for fiscal year was million as compared to million in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources we have reported cumulative net losses of approximately million for the three most recent fiscal years ended july  the net losses from date of inception  august   to july  amounts to approximately million 
we have financed our operations since inception primarily through the sale of our equity securities and convertible debentures in registered offerings and private placements 
additionally  we have raised capital through other debt financings  the sale of our state tax benefits and research products  and investment income and financing received from our chief executive officer 
as of july   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt 
we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand at july  can support our activities into the first quarter of our fiscal year based on our expected level of expenditures  which assumes timely and successful completion of our phase iiib clinical trial  and submission and approval of the related nda 
the primary use of cash over the next months will be to fund our regulatory and commercial efforts for onconase and our clinical and pre clinical research and development efforts 
the most significant expenses will be incurred in relation to completing the work necessary for our rolling nda submission and completion of the onconase phase iiib clinical trial 
additional expenses are also expected to be incurred as we continue to move our drug product candidates towards the next phase of clinical and pre clinical development 
we may seek to satisfy future funding requirements through public or private offerings of securities or with collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners 
additional financing may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if adequate financing is not available  we may be required to delay  scale back  or eliminate certain of our research and development programs  relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  drugs or products  or license third parties to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop ourselves 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no debt  no capital leases  no exposure to off balance sheet arrangements  no special purpose entities  nor activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value as of july  contractual obligations and commercial commitments our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to our building and equipment operating leases 
during the fiscal year ended july   we entered into a building and equipment operating leases  which obligates us to pay an average of  per month for the building and  per month for the equipment for ten and five years  respectively 
below is a table that presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july  payments due by fiscal year total and thereafter building lease     equipment lease      total contractual cash obligations     critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the accounting policies set forth below have been considered critical because changes to certain judgments  estimates and assumptions could significantly affect our financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
the carrying value of these investments approximates their fair market value due to their short maturity and liquidity 
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
maintenance and repairs that do not extend the life of assets are charged to expense when incurred 
when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operations for the period in which the transaction takes place 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
management provides valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered more likely than not to be realized 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  issued by the staff of the sec 
under sab no 
 revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we enter into marketing and distribution agreements  which contain multiple deliverables 
under the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables we evaluate whether these deliverables constitute separate units of accounting to which total arrangement consideration is allocated 
a deliverable qualifies as a separate unit of accounting when the item delivered to the customer has standalone value  there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of items that have not been delivered to the customer  and  if there is a general right of return for the items delivered to the customer  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company 
arrangement consideration is allocated to units of accounting on a relative fair value basis or the residual method if the company is unable to determine the fair value of all deliverables in the arrangement 
consideration allocated to a unit of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon future performance by the company 
upon determination of separate units of accounting and allocated consideration  the general criteria for revenue recognition are applied to each unit of accounting 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
these costs include  among other things  consulting fees and costs related to the conduct of human clinical trials 
we also allocate indirect costs  consisting primarily of operational costs for administering research and development activities  to research and development expenses 
share based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment sfas r  which amends sfas the new standard requires all share based payments  including stock option grants to employees  to be recognized as an operating expense in the statement of operations 
the expense is recognized over the requisite service period based on fair values measured on the date of grant 
we adopted sfas r effective august  using the modified prospective method and  accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
under the modified prospective method  the fair value of all new stock options issued after july  and the unamortized fair value of unvested outstanding stock options at august  are recognized as expense as services are rendered 
leases with respect to our operating leases  we apply the provisions of sfas accounting for leases and fasb technical bulletin ftb issues relating to accounting for leases  recognizing rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term due to escalating lease payments and landlord incentives 
contingencies liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation  fines  and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
recoveries from other parties are recorded when realized 
fair value of financial instruments financial instruments consist of cash  cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
the carrying value of these financial instruments is a reasonable estimate of fair value 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf addresses the diversity that exists with respect to the accounting for the nonrefundable portion of a payment made by a research and development entity for future research and development activities 
the eitf concluded that an entity must defer and capitalize nonrefundable advance payments made for research and development activities and expense these amounts as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
eitf will be effective for interim or annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of eitf will have  if any  on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
sfas will be effective for our company on august  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas will have  if any  on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a fasb staff position fsp eitf issue no 
accounting for registration payment arrangements fsp which addresses an issuer s accounting for registration payment arrangements 
fsp specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement  whether issued as a separate agreement or included as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement  should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with fasb statement no 
accounting for contingencies 
the guidance in fsp amends fasb statements no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and no  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  and fasb interpretation no  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others to include scope exceptions for registration payment arrangements 
fsp is effective immediately for registration payment arrangements and the financial instruments subject to those arrangements that are entered into or modified subsequent to the date of issue of fsp for registration payment arrangements and financial instruments subject to those arrangements that were entered into prior to the issuance of fsp  this is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have analyzed the provisions of fsp and determined that it will not have an effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require new fair value measurements 
we are required to adopt sfas as of august   and are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas will have  if any  on our reported financial results 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
quantifying misstatements in financial statements sab 
under sab  we are required to use a combination of the two previously acceptable approaches for quantifying misstatements  and to adjust our financial statements if this combined approach results in a conclusion that an error is material 
we adopted sab and determined that it did not have a material impact on our reported financial results 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a company s tax return 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and will  therefore  be effective for our fiscal quarter ending october   the first quarter of fiscal year ending july  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on our reported financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of july   we were exposed to market risks  primarily changes in us interest rates 
as of july   we held total cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
all cash equivalents have a maturity less than days 
declines in interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our investments 
based upon our balance of cash and cash equivalents as of july   a decrease in interest rates of would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income of approximately
