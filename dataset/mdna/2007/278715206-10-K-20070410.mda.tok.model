quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to certain market risks  including foreign currency and interest rates 
the majority of the company s operations are based in the us and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  the company has operations in australia  new zealand  singapore  canada and india  and conduct transactions in the local currencies of each location

the company does not feel such a change in interest rates would be significant to its results of operations 
the company does not currently use any derivative financial instruments
