table of contents during the year ended december   we completed the discontinuance of our winding equipment product line segment  which was sold in december  with the shipment of the final product order that we were obligated to fulfill 
therefore  the financial statements for fiscal  include the winding equipment product line segment in discontinued operations 
highlights for  we reported revenue of million and a net loss of million  or per diluted share  versus revenue of million and a net loss of million  or per diluted share for fiscal the higher net loss was a result of the production costs associated with our ramp up and phase in of increased manufacturing capacity within the boostcap product line 
we continue to face the challenge of ramping up production and keeping pace with demand while simultaneously achieving anticipated production efficiencies and cost reductions 
we expect to continue driving down production costs to meet the pricing requirements of the markets in which we compete 
once these efficiencies are fully achieved we anticipate achieving the manufacturing costs to meet our pricing strategy 
during fiscal  we developed strategic alliances  introduced new products  added capacity to meet future anticipated demand  provided capital improvements  perfected production processes 
some of these efforts are described below in january  general hydrogen corporation placed a  unit  three year  purchase order for boostcap ultracapacitors to enhance performance and energy management in its hydricity pack technology with strategic pricing conditioned on volume thresholds specified in the purchase order 
in february  enercon gmbh  one of the world s leading producers of wind energy systems  designated maxwell as a preferred supplier  and placed a million unit purchase order for ultracapacitors for wind turbine blade pitch systems

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared with million for the year ended december  compared to  total revenue increased million  or  from the prior year 
three quarters of the revenue increase came from the boostcap product line  which experienced increased demand for its products as well as license revenue that totaled million in approximately of the revenue increase came from the high tension product line 
management expects high tension revenue to continue to increase in  but at a lower rate than what was experienced in microelectronics revenue in was marginally lower than in maxwell expects microelectronics revenue to grow in driven by the npoess single board computer contract and demand for component products 
management believes that license revenue will continue in and we anticipate continued strong demand for boostcap products 
while the overall growth prospects for remain bright  we do expect company revenue for the first quarter of to be lower than it was in the fourth quarter  due to a major customer s internal production delays and due to shortages of other key materials for their products unrelated to ultracapacitors 
as this customer finds alternative sources of these non ultracapacitor key building blocks  we anticipate long term increased demand of our boostcap products 
gross profit gross profit for was approximately million  or of revenue  compared with million  or of revenue  for the prior year 
the gross profit within the boostcap product line decreased because of increased production costs associated with our ramp up and phase in of increased manufacturing capacity 
the challenge continues to be the ability to ramp up production and keep pace with demand while simultaneously achieving anticipated production efficiencies 
once these efficiencies are fully in place we anticipate achieving the required cost reductions to meet our pricing strategy 
we expect to continue driving down production costs to meet the pricing requirements of the markets in which we compete 
although our overall gross profit for was lower  there was an improvement in the gross profit of our high tension products compared with high tension gross profit improvements were primarily a result of reduced manufacturing costs and increased volume 
additionally  gross profit for microelectronics products improved compared with primarily as a result of increased single board computer demand from npoess 
for the year ended december  costs of sales also included  of stock compensation expense related to our adoption of sfas r versus the comparable period where there was no expense for stock compensation 
selling  general administrative sg a expense sg a expenses were million for compared with million for the increase is predominantly related to stock compensation expense for restricted stock and stock option awards of million recognized in related to our adoption of sfas r  compared with  for the same period in additionally  sales expense  including labor and labor related expenses  outside commissions and advertising  increased to support significantly increased boostcap revenue 
research development r d expense r d expenses were million for compared with million for increased r d spending was a result of new product development efforts for boostcap and microelectronics product lines as well as 
table of contents higher spending on intellectual property activity for patent filings 
boostcap development efforts included electrode  ultracapacitor  and module designs while microelectronics development efforts focused on single board computer development 
we introduced several new boostcap products in and we anticipate continuing our investment in r d at levels similar to provision benefit for income taxes we recorded a  tax provision during compared with a  tax provision during the provisions recorded relate to our swiss subsidiary 
the swiss subsidiary has a tax holiday  which was extended in for an additional five years 
we have not recorded an income tax benefit for our net loss from fiscal due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the associated deferred tax asset 
however  we have a recorded a deferred tax asset  of approximately million  and a deferred tax liability of similar amount  for the embedded conversion rights of our convertible debentures 
these amounts are netted in the balance sheet 
additionally  we have established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets other than those related to convertible debentures 
discontinued operations in march  we sold our government systems business for million and recorded a gain of million  net of a million provision mainly related to ongoing lease obligations 
as of december  there was no reserve provision as the lease expired in april we were named as a defendant in a suit filed on march  in the superior court of the state of california for the county of san luis obispo 
this suit  edmonds vs 
i bus phoenix  inc  was filed by the plaintiff on his behalf and allege damages concerning the repurchase of i bus phoenix  inc shares 
on september  a california jury ruled in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of  the company paid  including interest 
the expense is included in discontinued operations 
during fiscal  preferred shareholders of purepulse provided the company with a release of liability 
accordingly  a reserve of approximately  was reversed and is included in discontinued operations 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared with million for the year ended december  this represents an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
half of the revenue increase came from the boostcap product line  which experienced increased demand for its products as well as growth from the usabc contract revenue 
microelectronics revenue provided approximately of the revenue growth primarily due to revenue from the npoess contract 
revenue for the year ended december  included million in license fees received from yeong long technologies  inc yec and million from low margin magnetics based products  neither of which continued in gross profit gross profit for was approximately million  or of revenue  compared with million  or of revenue  for the prior year 
included in gross profit was the impact of contract revenue from both the usabc and npoess contracts 
these two contracts provided of the total gross profit for included in gross profit was the impact of license fee revenue from yec  which provided of the total of gross profit for excluding the impact of contract and license fee revenue  gross profit improvement during was driven primarily by the boostcap product line  which drove product costs below selling prices accepted at the end of 
table of contents boostcap volume increases drove of the gross profit improvement with the remainder driven by price 
reserves of million recorded for customer orders received in  which were priced below projected production costs  were fully utilized during additional reserves of approximately  were recorded in the first and third quarters of for customer orders received priced below production costs 
we have received a customer order subsequent to december  that is priced below projected production costs and will require a reserve of approximately  in the first quarter of additional reserves may be required against future orders depending on the degree to which we are able to reduce our product costs at the time orders are placed 
selling  general administrative sg a expense sg a expenses were million for compared with million for during  we recorded  for stock compensation expense and  for severance pay versus  of severance pay during sales commissions increased  and audit fees increased  in versus the voluntary reduction in executive pay realized in was reinstated in  and accounts for  of increased sg a cost 
higher compensation costs  excluding executive pay  were  which was driven primarily by new hires supporting our growth 
research development r d expense r d expenses were million for compared with million for increased r d spending was a result of new product development efforts for boostcap and microelectronics product lines as well as higher spending on intellectual property efforts for patent filings 
boostcap development efforts included electrode  ultracapacitor  and module designs while microelectronics development efforts focused on single board computer development 
we expect to introduce a large number of new boostcap products in and  therefore  expect to continue our investment in r d at levels similar to provision benefit for income taxes we recorded a  tax provision during compared with a  tax provision during the provisions recorded relate to our swiss subsidiary 
the swiss subsidiary had a tax holiday  which was extended in for an additional five years 
the extended tax holiday reduced maxwell s provision for income taxes by  in we have not recorded an income tax benefit for our net loss from fiscal due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the associated deferred tax asset 
however  we did record a deferred tax asset  of approximately million  and a deferred tax liability  of similar amount  for the embedded conversion rights of our convertible debentures 
these amounts are netted in the balance sheet 
additionally  we have established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets other than those related to convertible debentures 
discontinued operations the winding equipment product line included in discontinued operations had sales of million and cost of sales of  during  which are reflected in income from discontinued operations 
there was no activity related to the discontinued winding equipment product line in other events in  and  we made an assessment of the company s goodwill and intangible assets and determined that there was no impairment 
accordingly  no goodwill impairments were recognized for the years ended december   and 
table of contents amortization of other intangibles was  for the years ended december   and and relates to the amortization of developed core technology acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of montena components and the amortization of ultracapacitor intellectual property that was recorded in conjunction with the merger of the electronic components group  a majority owned subsidiary  into maxwell after the purchase of all shares not already owned by the company 
net interest expense for the year ended december  was  and interest income was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the large increase in interest payments creating an expense amount in is due to the convertible debt that was issued in december as a result of the registration rights on the shares acquired upon debt conversion and warrants exercised the fair value of the embedded conversion features and warrants are recorded as liabilities 
the initial fair value of million as of december  was treated as a discount to the million debenture and is being amortized over the four year life of the note 
in addition  there was million of prepaid fees related to the issuance of the convertible debt  which are also amortized over the four year life of the note 
the  of amortization of debt discount and prepaid fees is for the period of december  to december  the full year amortized debt discount and prepaid fees totals million for the year ended december  the fair value calculation at december  and was impacted by the change in maxwell s stock price and a reduction in the time which the holder has to exercise their rights 
the fair value of the embedded conversion features and warrants will be recalculated each reporting period and any difference in value from the prior period will be reflected in the statement of operations 
the future impact of fair value recalculations will be difficult to predict  given the historical volatility of maxwell s stock price  however  it is a non cash item and will not impact cash flow 
liquidity and capital resources changes in cash flow for the year ended december   cash used in operating activities was million compared with million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the use of cash for the years ended december    and was primarily attributed to operating losses from continuing operations in addition to increase accounts receivable and inventory balances in support of higher revenue 
capital expenditures for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
capital spending has been focused on automating production processes for the high tension and boostcap product lines 
capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million  which will be invested primarily in production equipment to increase capacity for the higher customer demand of boostcap products 
the financing activities for the years ended december   and were million  million and million with the majority of these proceeds from the issuance of stock and proceeds form long and short term borrowing 
liquidity as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash and approximately million in short term investments 
we have a line of credit for million swiss francs approximately million from a swiss bank for working capital in switzerland 
the line was fully used as of december  we also have a million swiss francs approximately  term loan from a swiss bank for capital equipment purchases 
approximately  of that facility was outstanding as of 
table of contents december  we have a million swiss francs approximately  line of credit with another swiss bank for working capital  approximately  of the line was utilized as of december  we entered into a lease agreement in may for the acquisition of manufacturing equipment up to a maximum of million swiss francs approximately million 
the lease term is months and  of the credit agreement had been used to purchase equipment under this agreement as of december  in december we secured a million loan from a us bank for capital equipment purchases  subject to a three year repayment period as of december  the entire line of the credit was drawn 
a million line of credit from a us bank  which was secured in and renewed in  was never used and we decided to not to renew it in january  we raised approximately million  net of issuance expenses  from a private placement of common stock in july we raised approximately million  net of issuance expenses  from the sale of convertible debentures in december warrants issued as part of the convertible debt placement would provide an additional million of cash if fully exercised 
we believe that the liquidity provided by existing cash  cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities  and borrowing available under our lines of credit  will provide sufficient capital to fund our capital equipment and working capital requirements and potential operating losses for more than the next months 
in november the company filed an s with the securities and exchange commission to from time to time sell up to an aggregate of  of the company common stock  warrants or debt securities 
if additional funds are required we have several options to raise capital that include negotiations to elimination the current restriction on million of cash or other options that include a bridge financing and or a private placement or public offering of marketable securities to provide additional liquidity 
debentures  short term and long term borrowings convertible debentures on december   the company issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated convertible debentures due and payable in quarterly installments from december through december the debentures and warrants to purchase  shares of maxwell common stock 
the net proceeds of the issuance totaled approximately million after direct placement costs of approximately million 
the debentures are convertible into million shares of maxwell s common stock at any time at the option of the holder 
interest is due quarterly with the interest rate fixed to the federal funds rate plus per annum 
all or a portion of the accrued and unpaid interest may be paid in shares of maxwell s common stock at the company s option 
for fiscal year ended december  we made interest payments of  with  shares of company common stock 
at the issuance date  the debentures were convertible by the holder at any time into common shares at a price of per share subject to adjustment upon certain events such as the sale of equity securities by maxwell at a price below the conversion price of the debenture 
after eighteen months from the issue date  maxwell may require that a specified amount of the principal of the debentures be converted if certain conditions are satisfied for a period of consecutive trading days 
the change in fair value on revaluation of debenture conversion rights and warrant liabilities represents the difference between the fair value of the warrants and debenture conversion between the two measurement dates using a black scholes calculation 
the effect of the fair market value adjustment are recorded as gain loss on embedded derivative liabilities 
the net fair value of the holder s and maxwell s conversion rights at december  and were liabilities of million  and million respectfully  these amounts are included in convertible debentures and long term debt on the balance sheet 

table of contents the warrants issued in connection with the issuance of the debentures had an exercise price of at the issuance date  subject to adjustment upon certain events such as the sale of equity securities by maxwell at a price below the then current exercise price 
the fair value of the warrants at december  and was million and million respectively and is included in stock warrants on the balance sheet 
the warrants are exercisable at any time through december  no warrants had been exercised as of december  as long as debentures are outstanding  the company is required to maintain a cash balance of million

table of contents stock sale in november and july  the company raised approximately and million  respectively  after deduction of expenses and fees through the sale of approximately million shares of common stock to institutional investors 
the company sold the shares directly to the investors in a negotiated transaction in which no underwriters were used for placement 
the shares had previously been registered under the securities act of  as amended  pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed on form s with the securities and exchange commission in september discontinued operations cash from discontinued operations has fluctuated from a source of cash in to a use of cash in and the use of cash from discontinued operations has been caused primarily by the purepulse business and by vacant facilities associated with the government systems business 
the source of cash in was a result of the discontinued winding equipment business  which generated sales of million in that more than offset the use of cash from the other discontinued operations 
government audits the company was the subject of government audits of two businesses sold or discontinued in a contract  not assumed by the acquirers of the company s former defense contract business  entered into in and completed in the late s was being audited by the defense department s auditing agency 
the defense department s audit was completed in and the company reimbursed an immaterial amount to finalize the audit 
the internal revenue service irs had assessed the company with a penalty of approximately  for failure to file form w s for a business sold in the acquiring company of our former business did write the irs stating that they would be responsible for the filing of form w s 
during  the irs fully released the company from the  penalty 
the defense department s auditing agency audited a contract entered into by our microelectronics group as a subcontractor in and completed in the company is contracted with a subcontractor  who received a letter after december  releasing them of any obligations from the primary contractor 
we have received a verbal release from the subcontractor and have requested that they provide a letter releasing maxwell from any obligations for the audit 
based on the information that we have received  we believe the contingent liability accrual is no longer probable 
therefore  the  liability was reversed in the fiscal year ending other events in  a customer brought to our attention a possible defect in a product that we sourced from another manufacturer and resold to the customer 
the matter has not been resolved and we have not yet been able to determine what  if any  warranty exposure maxwell may have  and therefore  we have not recorded any warranty reserve provision 
we carry insurance that we believe would cover all or a portion of any obligation that might ultimately arise from this matter 
minority equity interests in subsidiaries purepulse  which suspended operations in and is classified as discontinued operations  has minority equity investors 
these investors are former employees who were issued shares when purepulse originally was incorporated and former employees who have exercised stock options in that entity

table of contents contractual obligations payment due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase commitments debt obligations total operating lease obligations represent building leases  for us and switzerland locations 
purchase commitments primarily represent the value of non cancelable purchase orders and an estimate of purchase orders that if cancelled would result in a significant penalty to the company 
debt obligations represent long term and short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt and interest 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which we refer to as us gaap 
we have used certain assumptions and judgments in the preparation of these financial statements  which assumptions and estimates may potentially affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies as well as reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
the following may involve a high degree of judgment and complexity and  as such  management assumptions and conclusions in these areas may significantly impact the results of operations of the company 
revenue recognition for the fiscal year ended december   substantially all of our revenue was derived from the sale of manufactured products directly to customers and revenue recognized at the time costs were incurred for certain long term contracts 
licensing fees received for the right to manufacture products based on our proprietary ultracapacitors design was a revenue category in fiscal years ended december  and product revenue is recognized  according to the guidelines of sec staff accounting bulletin numbers revenue recognition in financial statements  and revenue recognition  when title passes to the customer at either shipment from our facilities  or receipt at the customer facility  depending on shipping terms  provided collectability is reasonably assured 
this method has been consistently applied from period to period and there is no right of return 
revenue on fixed price government contracts is recognized at the time costs are incurred and is calculated on a percentage of completion basis  in accordance with statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts and is limited by the funding of the prime contractor 
in prior years  certain continuing and discontinued segments involved revenues from both long term and short term fixed price contracts and cost plus contracts with the us government directly or through a prime contractor 
those revenues  including estimated profits  were recognized at the time the costs were incurred and included provisions for any anticipated losses 
these contracts are subject to rate audits and other audits  which could result in the reduction of revenue in excess of estimated provisions 
in turn  this could increase losses for the periods in which any such reduction occurs 
in the fiscal year ended december  the company recognized revenue that relates to specific deliverables  in accordance with eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this revenue involves a contract that grants a license to manufacture and market products in mainland china  using maxwell s proprietary large cell and multi cell module technology under a separate brand 
the contract  obligates the manufacturer to source ultracapacitor electrode material from maxwell  the agreement has no general right of return and requires no refunds 
table of contents excess and obsolete inventory we value inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with current and committed inventory levels 
the markets for the company s products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  new product development  product obsolescence and evolving industry standards 
in addition  price competition is intense and significant price erosion generally occurs over the life of a product 
we have recorded significant charges for reserves in recent periods to reflect changes in market conditions 
we believe that future events are subject to change and revisions in estimates may have a significant adverse impact on the balance sheet and statement of operations 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
the first step consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of the reporting units  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the residual fair value derived by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s assets and liabilities from its estimated fair value  which was calculated in step one 
the impairment charge represents the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of their goodwill 
we have determined the fair value of our reporting units based on the market value of the company s stock 
the market value of the company s stock at december  exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit and  therefore  the second step calculation to determine the implied fair value of goodwill was not necessary 
we cannot say with certainty that we may not incur charges for impairment of goodwill in the future if the fair value of maxwell technologies and maxwell sa decrease due to market conditions  revisions in our assumptions or other unanticipated circumstances 
any additional impairment charges will adversely affect our results of operations 
convertible debentures we account for convertible debentures and warrants in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard requires the conversion feature of convertible debt be separated from the host contract and presented as a derivative instrument if certain conditions are met 
eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company s own stock and eitf  the meaning of conventional convertible debt instrument in issue no 
were also analyzed to determine whether the debt instrument is to be considered a conventional convertible debt instrument and classified in stockholders equity 
the convertible debentures issued on december  were evaluated and determined not to be conventional convertible and  therefore  because of certain terms and provisions including liquidating damages under the associated registration rights agreement the embedded conversion option was bifurcated and has been accounted for as a derivative liability instrument 
the stock warrants issued in conjunction with the convertible debt on december  were also evaluated and determined to be a derivative instrument and  therefore  classified as a liability on the balance sheet 
the accounting guidance also requires that the conversion feature and warrants be recorded at fair value for each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in our statement of operations 
a black scholes valuation calculation was applied to both the conversion features and warrants at december   december  and the december  valuation was used for the effective debt discount that these instruments represent 
the debt discount is amortized over the four year life of the debentures using the effective interest method 
the december  and valuations were used to record 
table of contents the fair value of these instruments at the end of the reporting periods with any difference from prior period calculations reflected in the statement of operations 
the company s stock price is one input used in the black scholes calculation  which has a significant impact on the calculation 
the change in the company s stock price will have a gain or loss effect on embedded derivative liabilities in the statement of operations 
the volatility of the company s stock price is likely to generate large swings in the valuations of the conversion features and warrants in future periods 
stock compensation effective january  the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which establishes accounting for share based awards exchanged for employee services and requires companies to expense the estimated grant date fair value of these awards over the requisite employee service period
