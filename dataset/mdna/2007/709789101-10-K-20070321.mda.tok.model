item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other statistical information included in item of part ii of this annual report

application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
the most significant accounting policies that we follow are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheets 
note to consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses  and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included below under the caption financial condition market risk management 
results of operations we reported net income of  or per share  for the year ended december  which was an increase of  or over  or per share  for the year ended december  net interest income the primary source of our income is net interest income  which is the difference between revenue on interest earning assets  such as investment securities and loans  and interest incurred on interest bearing sources of funds  such as deposits and borrowings 
the level of net interest income is determined primarily by the average balance of interest earning assets and funding sources and the various rate spreads between our interest earning assets and our interest bearing funding sources 
the table average balances  interest  and yield that appears below shows our average volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for  and  and related income expense and yields 
changes in net interest income from period to period result from increases or decreases in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and increases or decreases in the average rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities 
the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is affected by the ability to manage the earning asset portfolio which includes loans  and the availability of particular sources of funds  such as noninterest bearing deposits 
the table analysis of changes in net interest income shows the amount of net interest income change from rate changes and from activity changes 
for the year ended december   net interest income increased  or  to  from  for the year ended december  net interest income for the year ended december  increased  or  over net interest income for the increase in net interest income in was the result of an increase of  in interest income offset by on increase in interest expense of  while s increase was the result of an increase of  in interest income offset by an increase to interest expense of  in  deposits grew moderately and our borrowed funds increased with loan demand  but in loan demand increased and we experienced a reduction in deposits  which caused an increase in borrowed funds 
net income increased since loan income was earning a higher yield than what was paid for borrowed funds 
the yield on interest earning assets on a fully taxable equivalent basis was in  in and in  with the combined effective rate on deposits and borrowed funds followed the same fluctuation by increasing from in to in and in the key performance measure for net interest income is the net margin on interest earning assets  or net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
our net interest margin for on a fully taxable equivalent basis was  compared to for and for management attempts to maintain a net margin on interest earning assets of or higher 
the net margin may decline  however  if competition increases  loan demand decreases  or the cost of funds rises faster than the return on loans and securities 
although such expectations are based on management s judgment  actual results will depend on a number of factors that cannot be predicted with certainty  and fulfillment of management s expectations cannot be assured

noninterest revenue noninterest revenue for the months ended december  was  compared to  in and  in these increases resulted primarily from increases in service charge income and overdraft checking fees during and when compared to  which were the direct result of the increase in volume of deposit accounts that we experienced during and a significant portion of the service charges were debit card fees  which were  a increase over for the year ended december  and  a increase over for the year ended december  these cards are gaining increased acceptance among our customer base

increases in net interest income and noninterest income with no provisions made to loan loss for the three months ended december   when compared to the corresponding period in  were offset by increased income taxes and increased noninterest expenses 
after provisions for loan losses  the net interest income increase of  from  for the three months ended december  to  for the three months ended december   was due primarily to loan revenues increasing faster than the cost of increased borrowed funds that we needed to fund loan demand 
when comparing the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of  interest revenue increased  while interest expense increased  with  of the increase being for borrowed funds 
there was also no funding to loan loss provisions in the fourth quarter of compared to  in noninterest income for the fourth quarter of increased  over noninterest income for the same period of to  this increase was due primarily to the increase in service charges as a result of an increased volume of deposits 
total noninterest expense increased  to  for the quarter ended decermber   from  for the corresponding quarter of this increase is primarily the result of an increase of  in salaries and employee benefits from  for the fourth quarter of to  for the corresponding quarter of directors fees increased  from  in to  in financial condition assets total assets increased to  at december  when compared to assets at december  average total assets for were  an increase of over the loan portfolio represented of average earning assets in  compared to in  and was the primary source of income for the company 
funding for loans is provided primarily by core deposits  fed funds  and federal home loan bank borrowings 
total deposits decreased to  at december   compared to the increase for over composition of loan portfolio because loans are expected to produce higher yields than investment securities and other interest earning assets assuming that loan losses are not excessive  the absolute volume of loans and the volume as a percentage of total earning assets is an important determinant of net interest margin

there are no industry concentrations in our loan portfolio 
a substantial portion of our loans are  however  secured by real estate and  accordingly  the real estate market in the region will influence the performance of our loan portfolio

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  to meet the financing needs of its customers  we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
we generally require collateral or other security to support the financial instruments with credit risk 
the amount of collateral or other security is determined based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
we evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
letters of credit are conditional commitments that we issue to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
letters of credit and other commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
because many of the letters of credit and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of part ii of this annual report  for further information about these commitments 
loan quality the allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for probable losses in the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated periodically based on a review of all significant loans  with a particular emphasis on non accruing  past due  and other loans that management believes require attention 
the determination of the reserve level rests upon management s judgment about factors affecting loan quality and assumptions about the economy 
management considers the year end allowance appropriate and adequate to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio  however  management s judgment is based upon a number of assumptions about future events  which are believed to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the loan loss allowance will not be required 
for significant problem loans  management s review consists of evaluation of the financial strengths of the borrowers and guarantors  the related collateral  and the effects of economic conditions 
the overall evaluation of the adequacy of the total allowance for loan losses is based on an analysis of historical loan loss ratios  loan charge offs  delinquency trends  and previous collection experience  along with an assessment of the effects of external economic conditions 
risk elements of loan portfolio for the years ended december non accrual loans accruing loans past due days or more the following table  allocation of allowance for loan losses  shows the specific allowance applied by loan type and also the general allowance included in the allowance for loan losses at december      and allocation of allowance for loan losses percentage percentage percentage percentage percentage commercial real estate consumer unallocated total percentage of loans in category to total loans the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings in the current period to replenish the allowance and maintain it at a level management has determined to be adequate 
the provision for loan loss was  in  which represents a decrease of  over the  that was funded in the provision in was  the fluctuations in the provision for loan losses were due to growth in the overall portfolio  specifically commercial real estate loans  which have a higher level of risk versus the banks historically low level of loss

these loans are classified as nonaccrual even though the presence of collateral or the borrower s financial strength may be sufficient to provide for ultimate repayment 
interest on nonaccrual loans is recognized only when received 
a delinquent loan is generally placed in nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due 
when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status  all interest that had been accrued on the loan but remains unpaid is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
we had nonperforming loans of     and  at december     and  respectively 
where real estate acquired by foreclosure and held for sale is included with nonperforming loans  the result comprises nonperforming assets 
nonperforming asset totals at december      and  were the same as nonperforming loan totals 
loans are classified as impaired when the collection of contractual obligations  including principal and interest  is doubtful 
management has identified no significant impaired loans as of december  investment securities our security portfolio is categorized as available for sale and held to maturity 
investment securities classified as available for sale are held for an indefinite period of time and may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions or for liquidity purposes as part of our overall asset liability management strategy 
available for sale securities are carried at market value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity  net of applicable income taxes 
we do not currently follow a strategy of making security purchases with a view of near term resales and  therefore  do not own any securities classified as trading securities 
investment securities classified as held to maturity are held until they mature 
held to maturity securities are held at amortized cost value

liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers and to fund current and planned expenditures 
liquidity is derived through increased customer deposits  maturities in the investment portfolio  loan repayments and income from earning assets 
to the extent that deposits are not adequate to fund customer loan demand  liquidity needs can be met in the short term funds markets 
the funds invested in federal funds sold also provide liquidity  as do lines of credit  overnight federal funds  and reverse repurchase agreements available from correspondent banks

market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates or equity pricing 
our principal market risk is interest rate risk that arises from our lending  investing and deposit taking activities 
our profitability is primarily dependent on the bank s net interest income 
interest rate risk can significantly affect net interest income to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different intervals than interest earning assets 
the degree to which these different assets mature or reprice is known as interest rate sensitivity 
the primary objective of asset liability management is to ensure the steady growth of net interest income 
to lessen the impact of these margin swings  the balance sheet should be structured so that repricing opportunities exist for both assets and liabilities in roughly equivalent amounts at approximately the same time intervals 
interest rate sensitivity may be controlled on either side of the balance sheet 
on the asset side  management can exercise some control on maturities 
also  loans may be structured with rate floors and ceilings on variable rate notes and by providing for repricing opportunities on fixed rate notes 
our investment portfolio  including federal funds sold  provides the most flexible and fastest control over rate sensitivity since it can generally be restructured more quickly than the loan portfolio 
on the liability side  deposit products can be restructured so as to offer incentives to attain the maturity distribution desired 
competitive factors sometimes make control over deposits more difficult and less effective 
the rate sensitive position  or gap  is the difference in the volume of rate sensitive assets and liabilities at a given time interval 
the general objective of gap management is to actively manage rate sensitive assets and liabilities to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the net interest margin 
management generally attempts to maintain a balance between rate sensitive assets and liabilities as the exposure period is lengthened to minimize our overall interest rate risk 
several aspects of the asset mix of the balance sheet are continually evaluated yield  credit quality  appropriate funding sources  and liquidity 
management of the liability mix of the balance sheet focuses on expanding the various funding sources 
the interest rate sensitivity position at december  is presented in the table interest sensitivity analysis 
the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  or the interest rate sensitivity gap  is shown at the bottom of the table 
we were liability sensitive for the first month time horizon and asset sensitive thereafter 
for asset sensitive institutions  if interest rates should decrease  the net interest margins should decline 
because all interest rates and yields do not adjust at the same velocity  the gap is only a general indicator of rate sensitivity

the model takes into consideration the effect of call features of investments as well as prepayments of loans in periods of declining rates 
when actual changes in interest rates occur  the changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may differ from the assumptions used in the model

our core deposits decreased  during primarily due to competition from other investment alternatives that generally pay higher yields 
in the past  deposits  and particularly core deposits  have been our primary source of funding and had enabled the company to meet its short term liquidity needs 
due to increased loan demand  we have borrowed from correspondent banks and the federal home loan bank of atlanta to meet liquidity needs 
the maturity distribution of our time deposits over  at december  is shown in the following table 
maturities of certificates of deposit and other time deposits of  or more december  after six after three through within three through after months six months months months total certificates of deposit  or more large certificate of deposit customers tend to be extremely sensitive to interest rates  making these deposits less reliable sources of funding for liquidity planning purposes than core deposits 
some financial institutions partially fund their balance sheets using large certificates of deposit obtained through brokers 
these brokered deposits are generally expensive and are unreliable as long term funding sources 
accordingly  we do not typically purchase brokered deposits 
the average balance of borrowings increased  or  in  compared to an increase of  or  in the increase in over was due primarily to the fact that deposits decreased during while the loan portfolio increased moderately
