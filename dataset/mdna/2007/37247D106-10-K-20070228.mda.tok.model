item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
risks relating to our businesses interest rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and profitability 
our insurance and investment products are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and expose us to the risk that falling interest rates will reduce our spread  or the difference between the returns we earn on the investments that support our obligations under these products and the amounts that we must pay policyholders and contractholders 
because we may reduce the interest rates we credit on most of these products only at limited  pre established intervals  and because some of them have guaranteed minimum crediting rates  declines in interest rates may adversely affect the profitability of those products 
during periods of increasing market interest rates  we may offer higher crediting rates on interest sensitive products  such as universal life insurance and fixed annuities  and we may increase crediting rates on in force products to keep these products competitive 
in addition  rapidly rising interest rates may cause increased policy surrenders  withdrawals from life insurance policies and annuity contracts and requests for policy loans  as policyholders and contractholders shift assets into higher yielding investments 
increases in crediting rates  as well as surrenders and withdrawals  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our term life and long term care insurance products also expose us to the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
the pricing and expected future profitability of these products are based in part on expected investment returns 
over time  term life and long term care insurance products generally produce positive cash flows as customers pay periodic premiums  which we invest as we receive them 
low interest rates may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins and may adversely affect the profitability of our term life and long term care insurance products 
in the us mortgage market  rising interest rates generally reduce the volume of new mortgage originations 
a decline in the volume of new mortgage originations would have an adverse effect on our new mortgage insurance written 
rising interest rates also can increase the monthly mortgage payments for insured homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages arm which could have the effect of increasing default rates on arm loans and thereby increasing our exposure on our mortgage insurance policies 
this is particularly relevant in our non us mortgage insurance business  where arms are the predominant mortgage product 
arms also have increased as a percentage of the us mortgage loans that we insure 
declining interest rates increase the rate at which insured borrowers refinance their existing mortgages  thereby resulting in cancellations of the mortgage insurance covering the refinanced loans 
declining interest rates may also contribute to home price appreciation  which may provide insured borrowers in the us with the option of canceling their mortgage insurance coverage earlier than we anticipated in pricing that coverage 
these cancellations could have an adverse effect on our results from our mortgage insurance business 
interest rate fluctuations also could have an adverse effect on the results of our investment portfolios 
during periods of declining market interest rates  the interest we receive on variable interest rate investments decreases 
in addition  during those periods  we are forced to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of 
table of contents principal on our investments in lower yielding high grade instruments or in lower credit instruments to maintain comparable returns 
issuers of fixed income securities also may decide to prepay their obligations in order to borrow at lower market rates  which exacerbates the risk that we may have to invest the cash proceeds of these securities in lower yielding or lower credit instruments 
interest rates during reached an historic low and have increased through downturns and volatility in equity markets could adversely affect our business and profitability 
significant downturns and volatility in equity markets could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in two principal ways 
first  market downturns and volatility may discourage purchases of separate account products  such as variable annuities and variable life insurance  that have returns linked to the performance of the equity markets and may cause some existing customers to withdraw cash values or reduce investments in those products 
second  downturns and volatility in equity markets can have an adverse effect on the revenues and returns from our mutual fund wrapped and separately managed account products and services 
because these products and services generate fees generally from the value of assets under management  a decline in the equity markets could reduce our revenues by reducing the value of the investment assets we manage 
defaults in our fixed income securities and commercial mortgage loan portfolio may reduce our income 
issuers of the fixed income securities and commercial mortgage loans that we own may default on principal and interest payments 
as of december  and  we had fixed maturities in or near default where the issuer has missed payment of principal or interest or entered bankruptcy with a fair value of million and million  respectively 
an economic downturn  or a variety of other factors could cause declines in the value of our fixed maturities portfolio and cause our net income to decline 
a downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could result in a loss of business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
financial strength ratings  which various ratings organizations publish as measures of an insurance company s ability to meet contractholder and policyholder obligations  are important to maintaining public confidence in our products  the ability to market our products and our competitive position 
our principal life insurance companies currently have financial strength ratings of aa very strong from s p and fitch and aa excellent from moody s 
our mortgage insurance companies currently have financial strength ratings of aa very strong from s p and fitch  aa excellent from moody s and or aa superior from dbrs 
the aa and aa ratings are the third and fourth highest of s p s ratings categories  respectively 
the aa and aa ratings are the third and fourth highest of moody s ratings categories  respectively 
the aa and aa ratings are the third and fourth highest of fitch s ratings categories 
the aa rating is the second highest of dbrs s ratings categories 
a downgrade in our financial strength ratings  or the announced potential for a downgrade  could have a significantly adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways  including reducing new sales of insurance products  annuities and other investment products  adversely affecting our relationships with independent sales intermediaries and our dedicated sales specialists  materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders  requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and services to remain competitive  adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance or obtain reasonable pricing on reinsurance  and increasing our cost of borrowing 

table of contents if our mortgage insurance companies financial strength ratings decrease below the thresholds established by fannie mae and freddie mac aa by s p and aa by moody s  we would not be able to insure mortgages purchased by fannie mae or freddie mac 
as of december   fannie mae and freddie mac purchased the majority of the flow loans we insured in the us an inability to insure mortgage loans sold to fannie mae or freddie mac  or their transfer of our existing policies to an alternative mortgage insurer  would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if our reserves for future policy claims are inadequate  we may be required to increase our reserve liabilities  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we calculate and maintain reserves for estimated future payments of claims to our policyholders and contractholders in accordance with us gaap and industry accounting practices 
we release these reserves as those future obligations are extinguished 
the reserves we establish necessarily reflect estimates and actuarial assumptions with regard to our future experience 
these estimates and actuarial assumptions involve the exercise of significant judgment 
our future financial results depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual future experience is consistent with the assumptions we have used in pricing our products and determining our reserves 
many factors can affect future experience  including economic and social conditions  inflation  healthcare costs  policyholder persistency resulting in adverse claims experience  and changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards in litigation 
therefore  we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments 
we regularly monitor our reserves 
if we conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected policy and contract benefits and claims payments  we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
as a holding company  we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us to pay dividends and to meet our obligations 
we act as a holding company for our insurance subsidiaries and do not have any significant operations of our own 
dividends from our subsidiaries and permitted payments to us under our tax sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries are our principal sources of cash to pay stockholder dividends and to meet our obligations 
these obligations include our operating expenses  interest and principal on our current and any future borrowings and contract adjustment payments on our equity units 
these obligations also include amounts we owe to ge under the tax matters agreement that we and ge entered into in connection with our ipo 
if the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to dividend payment and tax sharing arrangements is insufficient for us to fund any of these obligations  we may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of debt  the issuance of additional equity or the sale of assets 
the payment of dividends and other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance laws and regulations 
in general  dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require insurance regulatory approval 
in addition  insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employee or other services if they determine that such payment could be adverse to our policyholders or contractholders 
the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us  and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders  are also subject to various conditions imposed by the rating agencies for us to maintain our ratings 
intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability 
our businesses are subject to intense competition 
we believe the principal competitive factors in the sale of our products are product features  price  commission structure  marketing and distribution arrangements  brand  reputation  financial strength ratings and service 

table of contents many other companies actively compete for sales in our protection and retirement income and investments markets  including other major insurers  banks  other financial institutions  mutual fund and money asset management firms and specialty and capital markets providers 
in addition  alternative products that leverage the capital markets could compete with traditional insurance products and reduce our market share 
the principal direct and indirect competitors for our us and increasingly  international mortgage insurance businesses include other private mortgage insurers and structured transactions in the capital markets and with other financial instruments designed to manage credit risk  such as credit default swaps and credit linked notes  with lenders who forego mortgage insurance  or self insure  on loans held in their portfolios  and with lenders that provide mortgage reinsurance through captive mortgage reinsurance programs 
further  we also compete with governmental and quasi governmental agencies  including in the us  the fha and to a lesser degree  the va  fannie mae and freddie mac 
in canada and some european countries  our mortgage insurance business competes directly with government entities  which provide comparable mortgage insurance 
government entities with which we compete typically do not have the same capital requirements and do not have the same profit objectives as we do 
in many of our product lines  we face competition from competitors that have greater market share or breadth of distribution  offer a broader range of products  services or features  assume a greater level of risk  have lower profitability expectations or have higher financial strength ratings than we do 
many competitors offer similar products and use similar distribution channels 
the substantial expansion of banks and insurance companies distribution capacities and expansion of product features in recent years have intensified pressure on margins and production levels and have increased the level of competition in many of our business lines 
in addition  in recent years  banks  insurance companies and other financial services companies  many of which offer products similar to ours and use similar distribution channels  have consolidated 
further consolidation among banks  insurance companies and other financial services companies could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations if the surviving entity requires more favorable terms than we had previously been offering to one or more of the combined companies or if it elects not to continue to do business with us following the consolidation 
reinsurance may not be available  affordable or adequate to protect us against losses 
as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments 
market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase 
accordingly  we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms  which could adversely affect our ability to write future business 
if the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements or to the derivative instruments we use to hedge our business risks default or fail to perform  we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we use reinsurance and derivative instruments to mitigate our risks in various circumstances 
reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders  even when the reinsurer is liable to us 
accordingly  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers 
we cannot assure you that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverable owed to us now or in the future or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis 
a reinsurer s insolvency  inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
prior to the completion of the ipo  we ceded to uflic  effective as of january   policy obligations under our structured settlement contracts  which had reserves of billion  and our variable annuity contracts  which had general account reserves of billion and separate account reserves of billion  in each case as of december  these contracts represent substantially all of our contracts that were in force as of december  for these products 
in addition  effective as of january   we ceded to uflic policy 
table of contents obligations under a block of long term care insurance policies that we reinsured from the travelers insurance company travelers  which had reserves of billion as of december  uflic has established trust accounts for our benefit to secure its obligations under the reinsurance arrangements  and general electric capital corporation  an indirect subsidiary of ge  or ge capital  has agreed to maintain uflic s risk based capital above a specified minimum level 
if uflic becomes insolvent notwithstanding this agreement  and the amounts in the trust accounts are insufficient to pay uflic s obligations to us  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we use derivative instruments to hedge various business risks 
we enter into a variety of derivative instruments  including options  interest rate and currency swaps with a number of counterparties 
if our counterparties fail or refuse to honor their obligations under the derivative instruments  our hedges of the related risk will be ineffective 
such failure could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and international securities markets could negatively affect our profitability 
our international operations generate revenues denominated in local currencies 
for the years ended december   and   and of our revenues  respectively  and  and of our net income from continuing operations  respectively  were generated by our international operations 
we generally invest cash generated by our international operations in securities denominated in local currencies 
as of december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our invested assets were held by our international operations and were invested primarily in non us denominated securities 
although investing in securities denominated in local currencies limits the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuation on local operating results  we remain exposed to the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates as we translate the operating results of our foreign operations into our financial statements 
we currently do not hedge this exposure  and as a result  period to period comparability of our results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
for example  our net income for the year ended december  included approximately million  net of tax  due to the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  because we derive a significant portion of our income from non us denominated revenue  our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent the dollar value of non us denominated revenue is reduced due to a strengthening non us dollar 
our investments in non us denominated securities are subject to fluctuations in non us securities and currency markets  and those markets can be volatile 
non us currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our non us subsidiaries to their parent companies in the us our insurance businesses are heavily regulated  and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth 
our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations 
state insurance laws regulate most aspects of our us insurance businesses  and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and licensed 
our non us insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled 
state laws in the us grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to  among other things licensing companies and agents to transact business  calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements  mandating certain insurance benefits  regulating certain premium rates  reviewing and approving policy forms  
table of contents regulating unfair trade and claims practices  including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices  distribution arrangements and payment of inducements  establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards  fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts  approving changes in control of insurance companies  restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates  and regulating the types  amounts and valuation of investments 
state insurance regulators and the naic regularly reexamine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products 
changes in these laws and regulations  or in interpretations thereof  can be made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and thus could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our mortgage insurance business is subject to additional laws and regulations 
for a discussion of the risks associated with those laws and regulations  see risks relating to our mortgage insurance business changes in regulations that affect the mortgage insurance business could affect our operations significantly and could reduce the demand for mortgage insurance 
we have significant operations internationally that could be adversely affected by changes in political or economic stability or government policies where we operate 
we have a presence in more than countries around the world 
global economic and regulatory developments could affect our business in many ways 
for example  our operations are subject to local regulations  which in many ways are similar to the state regulations outlined above 
many of our international customers and independent sales intermediaries also operate in regulated environments 
changes in the regulations that affect their operations also may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or to distribute our products 
these changes could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel intensive  and changes in these laws and regulations may increase materially our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business  thus having an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
local economic conditions  including inflation  recession and currency fluctuations  as discussed above  also affect our international businesses 
political changes  some of which may be disruptive  can interfere with our customers and all of our activities in a particular location 
attempts to mitigate these risks can be costly and are not always successful 
we also outsource certain services to international providers 
for example  through arrangements with outsourcing providers in india  we have a substantial team of professionals who provide a variety of services to our insurance operations  including customer service  transaction processing  and functional support including finance  investment research  actuarial  risk and marketing 
a significant change in india s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could adversely affect business and economic conditions in india generally and our business in particular 
the political or regulatory climate in the us  europe or elsewhere could change so that it would not be practical or legal for us to use international operations centers  such as call centers 
for example  changes in privacy regulations  or more stringent interpretation or enforcement of these regulations  could require us to curtail our use of low cost operations in india to service our businesses  which could reduce the cost benefits we currently realize from these operations 

table of contents legal and regulatory investigations and actions are increasingly common in the insurance business and may result in financial losses and harm our reputation 
we face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses  including the risk of class action lawsuits 
our pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to us and others generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate 
in our insurance operations  we are  have been  or may become subject to class actions and individual suits alleging  among other things  issues relating to sales or underwriting practices  payment of contingent or other sales commissions  claims payments and procedures  product design  product disclosure  administration  additional premium charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis  denial or delay of benefits  charging excessive or impermissible fees on products  recommending unsuitable products to customers  our pricing structures and business practices in our mortgage insurance business  such as captive reinsurance arrangements with lenders and contract underwriting services  violations of respa or related state anti inducement laws and breaching fiduciary or other duties to customers 
in our investment related operations  we are subject to litigation involving commercial disputes with counterparties 
we are also subject to litigation arising out of our general business activities such as our contractual and employment relationships 
plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large or indeterminate amounts  including punitive and treble damages  which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
we are also subject to various regulatory inquiries  such as information requests  subpoenas and books and record examinations  from state  federal and international regulators and other authorities 
a substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation  regulatory action or investigation  we could suffer significant reputational harm  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for further discussion of current investigations and proceedings in which we are involved  see item legal proceedings 
we cannot assure you that these investigations and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
it is also possible that we could become subject to further investigations and have lawsuits filed or enforcement actions initiated against us 
in addition  increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings could result in new legal precedents and industry wide regulations or practices that could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operation 
for example  the naic and certain state insurance departments have adopted or proposed additional reporting and disclosure requirements relating to finite risk reinsurance 
our computer systems may fail or their security may be compromised  which could damage our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 
our business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of our computer systems 
we rely on these systems throughout our business for a variety of functions  including processing claims and applications  providing information to customers and distributors  performing actuarial analyses and maintaining financial records 
despite the implementation of security and back up measures  our computer systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions  computer viruses or other attacks  programming errors and similar disruptive problems 
the failure of these systems for any reason could cause significant interruptions to our operations  which could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
we retain confidential information in our computer systems  and we rely on sophisticated commercial technologies to maintain the security of those systems 
anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our computer systems could access  view  misappropriate  alter  or delete any information in the systems  including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information 
in addition  an increasing number of states and foreign countries require that customers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of personally identifiable customer information 
any compromise of the security of our computer systems that results in inappropriate disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation in the marketplace  deter people from purchasing our products  subject us to significant civil and criminal liability and require us to incur significant technical  legal and other expenses 

table of contents the occurrence of natural or man made disasters or a disease pandemic could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 
we are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters  including earthquakes  hurricanes  floods and tornadoes  and man made disasters  including acts of terrorism and military actions and disease pandemics such as could arise from the avian flu 
for example  a natural or man made disaster or a disease pandemic could lead to unexpected changes in persistency rates as policyholders and contractholders who are affected by the disaster may be unable to meet their contractual obligations  such as payment of premiums on our insurance policies  deposits into our investment products  and mortgage payments on loans insured by our mortgage insurance policies 
they could also significantly increase our mortality and morbidity experience above the assumptions we used in pricing our insurance and investment products 
the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets  and a natural or man made disaster or a disease pandemic could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster 
these consequences could  among other things  result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas  as well as an adverse effect on home prices in those areas  which could result in increased loss experience in our mortgage insurance business 
disasters or a disease pandemic also could disrupt public and private infrastructure  including communications and financial services  which could disrupt our normal business operations 
a natural or man made disaster or a disease pandemic also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us 
for example  a natural or man made disaster or a disease pandemic could lead to increased reinsurance prices and potentially cause us to retain more risk than we otherwise would retain if we were able to obtain reinsurance at lower prices 
in addition  a disaster or a disease pandemic could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio if it affects companies ability to pay principal or interest on their securities 
see we may face losses if there are significant deviations from our assumptions regarding the future persistency of our insurance policies and annuity contracts and a deterioration in economic conditions or a decline in home price appreciation may adversely affect our loss experience in mortgage insurance 
risks relating to our protection and retirement income and investments segments we may face losses if morbidity rates  mortality rates or unemployment rates differ significantly from our pricing expectations 
we set prices for our insurance and some annuity products based upon expected claims and payment patterns  using assumptions for  among other things  morbidity rates  or likelihood of sickness  and mortality rates  or likelihood of death  of our policyholders and contractholders 
the long term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual experience compares with our pricing assumptions 
for example  if morbidity rates are higher  or mortality rates are lower  than our pricing assumptions  we could be required to make greater payments under long term care insurance policies and annuity contracts than we had projected 
conversely  if mortality rates are higher than our pricing assumptions  we could be required to make greater payments under our life and payment protection insurance policies and annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum death benefits than we had projected 
the risk that our claims experience may differ significantly from our pricing assumptions is particularly significant for our long term care insurance products 
long term care insurance policies provide for long duration coverage and  therefore  our actual claims experience will emerge over many years after pricing assumptions have been established 
moreover  as a relatively new product in the market  long term care insurance does not have the extensive claims experience history of life insurance  and as a result  our ability to forecast future claim rates for long term care insurance is more limited than for life insurance 
in pricing our payment protection insurance  we also use assumptions regarding unemployment levels 
if unemployment levels are higher than our pricing assumptions  the claims frequency could be higher for our payment protection insurance business than we had projected 

table of contents we may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the present value of future profits  which would increase our expenses and reduce profitability 
deferred acquisition costs dac represent costs which vary with and are primarily related to the sale and issuance of our insurance policies and investment contracts that are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies 
these costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions  solicitation and printing costs  sales material and some support costs  such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses 
under us gaap  dac is subsequently amortized to income  over the lives of the underlying contracts  in relation to the anticipated recognition of premiums or gross profits 
in addition  when we acquire a block of insurance policies or investment contracts  we assign a portion of the purchase price to the right to receive future net cash flows from existing insurance and investment contracts and policies 
this intangible asset  called the present value of future profits pvfp  represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies 
we amortize the value of this intangible asset in a manner similar to the amortization of dac 
our amortization of dac and pvfp generally depends upon anticipated profits from investments  surrender and other policy and contract charges  mortality  morbidity and maintenance expense margins 
unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses  investment returns  mortality  morbidity  withdrawals or lapses may cause us to increase the amortization of dac or pvfp  or both  or to record a charge to increase benefit reserves 
we regularly review dac and pvfp to determine if they are recoverable from future income 
if these costs are not recoverable  they are charged to expenses in the financial period in which we make this determination 
for example  if we determine that we are unable to recover dac from profits over the life of a block of insurance policies or annuity contracts  or if withdrawals or surrender charges associated with early withdrawals do not fully offset the unamortized acquisition costs related to those policies or annuities  we would be required to recognize the additional dac amortization as a current period expense 
as of december  and  respectively  we had billion and billion of dac  and billion and billion of pvfp 
our net amortization of dac and pvfp was billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we may be required to recognize impairment in the value of our goodwill  which would increase our expenses and reduce our profitability 
goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire our subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of the acquisition 
under us gaap  we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level  which is either an operating segment or a business one level below the operating segment 
goodwill is impaired if the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole is less than the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  plus the carrying value of goodwill  at the date of the test 
for example  goodwill may become impaired if the fair value of a reporting unit as a whole were to decline by an amount greater than the decline in the value of its individual identifiable assets and liabilities 
this may occur for various reasons  including changes in actual or expected income or cash flows of a reporting unit  generation of income by a reporting unit at a lower rate of return than similar businesses or declines in market prices for publicly traded businesses similar to our reporting units 
if any portion of our goodwill becomes impaired  we would be required to recognize the amount of the impairment as a current period expense 
as of december  and  we had billion and billion  respectively  of goodwill related to our protection and retirement income and investments segments 
our reputation in the long term care insurance market may be adversely affected if we were to raise premiums on our in force long term care insurance products 
while we have not increased premiums on any direct in force long term care policies that we have issued  the terms of all our long term care insurance policies permit us to increase premiums during the premium paying 
table of contents period 
any premium increase could have an adverse effect on our reputation  our ability to market and sell new long term care insurance products  our ability to retain existing policyholders  agent attrition  independent channel market share and morbidity trends 
medical advances  such as genetic research and diagnostic imaging  and related legislation could adversely affect the financial performance of our life insurance  long term care insurance and annuities businesses 
genetic research includes procedures focused on identifying key genes that render an individual predisposed to specific diseases  such as particular types of cancer and other diseases 
other medical advances  such as diagnostic imaging technologies  also may be used to detect the early onset of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease 
we believe that if individuals learn through medical advances that they are predisposed to particular conditions that may reduce life longevity or require long term care  they will be more likely to purchase our life and long term care insurance policies or not to permit existing polices to lapse 
in contrast  if individuals learn that they lack the genetic predisposition to develop the conditions that reduce longevity or require long term care  they will be less likely to purchase our life and long term care insurance products but more likely to purchase certain annuity products 
in addition  such individuals that are existing policyholders will be more likely to permit their policies to lapse 
if we were to gain access to the same genetic or medical information as our prospective policyholders and contractholders  then we would be able to take this information into account in pricing our life and long term care insurance policies and annuity contracts 
however  there are a number of legislative and regulatory actions and proposals that make  or could make  genetic and other medical information confidential and unavailable to insurance companies 
pursuant to these legislative and regulatory actions and proposals  prospective policyholders and contractholders would only disclose this information if they chose to do so voluntarily 
these factors could lead us to reduce sales of products affected by these legislative and regulatory actions and proposals and could result in a deterioration of the risk profile of our portfolio  which could lead to payments to our policyholders and contractholders that are higher than we anticipated 
medical advances also could lead to new forms of preventative care 
preventative care could extend the life and improve the overall health of individuals 
if this were to occur  the duration of payments under certain of our annuity products likely would increase  thereby reducing net income in that business 
we may face losses if there are significant deviations from our assumptions regarding the future persistency of our insurance policies and annuity contracts 
the prices and expected future profitability of our insurance and deferred annuity products are based in part upon expected patterns of premiums  expenses and benefits  using a number of assumptions  including those related to persistency  which is the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next 
the effect of persistency on profitability varies for different products 
for most of our life insurance  group life and health insurance  and deferred annuity products  actual persistency that is lower than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability  especially in the early years of a policy or contract primarily because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy or contract 
for our universal life insurance policies  increased persistency that is the result of the sale of policies by the insured to third parties that continue to make premium payments on policies that would otherwise have lapsed  also known as life settlements  could have an adverse impact on profitability because of the higher claims rate associated with settled policies 
for our long term care insurance and some other health insurance policies  actual persistency in later policy durations that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have a negative impact on profitability 
if these policies remain in force longer than we assumed  then we could be required to make greater benefit payments than we had anticipated when we priced these products 
this risk is particularly significant in our long term care insurance business because we do not have the experience history that we have in many of our other businesses 

table of contents as a result  our ability to predict persistency for long term care insurance is more limited than for many other products 
some of our long term care insurance policies have experienced higher persistency than we had assumed  which has resulted in adverse claims experience 
because our assumptions regarding persistency experience are inherently uncertain  reserves for future policy benefits and claims may prove to be inadequate if actual persistency experience is different from those assumptions 
although some of our products permit us to increase premiums during the life of the policy or contract  we cannot guarantee that these increases would be sufficient to maintain profitability 
moreover  many of our products do not permit us to increase premiums or limit those increases during the life of the policy or contract 
significant deviations in experience from pricing expectations regarding persistency could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products 
regulation xxx may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations by requiring us to increase our statutory reserves for term life and universal life insurance or incur higher operating costs 
the model regulation entitled valuation of life insurance policies  commonly known as regulation xxx  requires insurers to establish additional statutory reserves for term life insurance policies with long term premium guarantees 
in addition  valuation of life insurance policies regulation  as clarified by actuarial guideline more commonly known as regulation axxx requires insurers to establish additional statutory reserves for certain universal life policies with secondary guarantees 
virtually all our newly issued term and universal life insurance business is now affected by regulation xxx and axxx  respectively 
in response to this regulation  we have increased term and universal life insurance statutory reserves and changed our premium rates for term life insurance products 
we also have implemented reinsurance and capital management actions to mitigate the capital and tax impact of regulation xxx and axxx 
however  we cannot assure you that there will not be regulatory  tax or other challenges to the actions we have taken to date 
the result of those potential challenges could require us to increase statutory reserves or incur higher operating and or tax costs 
any change to or repeal of regulation xxx or axxx could reduce the competitive advantage of our reinsurance and capital management actions and could adversely affect our market position in the life insurance market 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to implement actions to mitigate the impact of regulation xxx or axxx on future sales of term and universal life insurance products 
if we are unable to continue to implement those actions  we may be required to increase statutory reserves  incur higher operating costs than we currently anticipate  or reduce our sales of these products 
we also may have to implement measures that may be disruptive to our business 
for example  because term and universal life insurance are particularly price sensitive products  any increase in premiums charged on these products in order to compensate us for the increased statutory reserve requirements or higher costs of reinsurance may result in a significant loss of volume and adversely affect our life insurance operations 
if demand for long term care insurance continues to decline  we will not be able to execute our strategy to expand our long term care business 
we have devoted significant resources to developing our long term care insurance business  and our growth strategy relies partly upon continued growth of the sale of this product 
in recent years  industry sales of individual long term care insurance have declined 
annualized first year premiums for individual long term care insurance achieved a historical high in at approximately billion and decreased by to million in  according to limra international 
we believe this decrease was due primarily to decisions by several providers to cease offering long term care insurance  to raise premiums on in force policies and or to introduce new products with higher prices 
these actions resulted in decreased purchases of long term care insurance products and have caused some distributors to reduce their sales focus on these products 
while our 
table of contents individual long term care sales have grown over the preceding year  our annualized first year premiums of long term care insurance from to were relatively flat 
if the market for long term care insurance continues to decline  we may be unable to realize our growth strategy in this area and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
risks relating to our mortgage insurance segment fannie mae  freddie mac and a small number of large mortgage lenders exert significant influence over the us mortgage insurance market 
our mortgage insurance products protect mortgage lenders and investors from default related losses on residential first mortgage loans made primarily to home buyers with high loan to value mortgages generally  those home buyers who make down payments of less than of their home s purchase price 
the largest purchasers and guarantors of mortgage loans in the us are fannie mae and freddie mac  which were created by congressional charter to ensure that mortgage lenders have sufficient funds to continue to finance home purchases 
fannie mae and freddie mac purchased approximately for the years ended december  and and for the year ended december  of all the mortgage loans originated in the us  according to statistics published by inside mortgage finance 
we believe the reduction in the percentage of mortgages purchased by fannie mae and freddie mac has reduced the market size for flow private mortgage insurance 
fannie mae s and freddie mac s charters generally prohibit them from purchasing any mortgage with a face amount that exceeds of the home s value  unless that mortgage is insured by a qualified insurer or the mortgage seller retains at least a participation in the loan or agrees to repurchase the loan in the event of default 
as a result  high loan to value mortgages purchased by fannie mae or freddie mac generally are insured with private mortgage insurance 
these provisions in fannie mae s and freddie mac s charters create much of the demand for private mortgage insurance in the us fannie mae and freddie mac are also subject to regulatory oversight by hud and ofheo 
as of december   fannie mae and freddie mac purchased the majority of the flow mortgage loans that we insured 
as a result  a change in the charter provisions or other statutes or regulations relating to their purchase or guarantee activity could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
increasing consolidation among mortgage lenders resulted in significant customer concentration for us mortgage insurers 
as a result of this significant concentration  fannie mae  freddie mac and the largest mortgage lenders possess substantial market power  which enables them to influence our business and the mortgage insurance industry in general 
although we actively monitor and develop our relationships with fannie mae  freddie mac and our largest mortgage lending customers  a deterioration in any of these relationships  or the loss of business from any of our key customers  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if the fhlb s reduce their purchases of mortgage loans  purchase uninsured mortgage loans or use other credit enhancement products  this could have an adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
a decrease in the volume of high loan to value home mortgage originations or an increase in the volume of mortgage insurance cancellations could result in a decline in our revenue 
we provide mortgage insurance primarily for high loan to value mortgages 
factors that could lead to a decrease in the volume of high loan to value mortgage originations include a change in the level of home mortgage interest rates  a decline in economic conditions generally  or in conditions in regional and local economies  the level of consumer confidence  which may be adversely affected by economic instability  war or terrorist events  declines in the price of homes  adverse population trends  including lower homeownership rates  
table of contents high rates of home price appreciation  which in times of heavy refinancing affect whether refinanced loans have loan to value ratios that require mortgage insurance  and changes in government housing policy encouraging loans to first time homebuyers 
a decline in the volume of high loan to value mortgage originations would reduce the demand for mortgage insurance and  therefore  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a significant percentage of the premiums we earn each year in our us mortgage insurance business are renewal premiums from insurance policies written in previous years 
we estimate that approximately of our us gross premiums written in each of the years ended december  and  were renewal premiums 
as a result  the length of time insurance remains in force is an important determinant of our mortgage insurance revenues 
fannie mae  freddie mac and many other mortgage investors in the us generally permit a homeowner to ask his loan servicer to cancel his mortgage insurance when the principal amount of the mortgage falls below of the home s value 
factors that tend to reduce the length of time our mortgage insurance remains in force include declining interest rates  which may result in the refinancing of the mortgages underlying our insurance policies with new mortgage loans that may not require mortgage insurance or that we do not insure  significant appreciation in the value of homes  which causes the size of the mortgage to decrease below of the value of the home and enables the borrower to request cancellation of the mortgage insurance  and changes in mortgage insurance cancellation requirements under applicable federal law or mortgage insurance cancellation practices by mortgage lenders and investors 
our us policy persistency rates increased from for the year ended december  to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
a decrease in persistency in the us generally would reduce the amount of our insurance in force and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
these factors are less significant in our international mortgage insurance operations because we generally receive a single payment for mortgage insurance at the time a loan closes  and this premium typically is not refundable if the policy is canceled 
the amount of mortgage insurance we write could decline significantly if alternatives to private mortgage insurance are used or lower coverage levels of mortgage insurance are selected 
there are a variety of alternatives to private mortgage insurance that may reduce the amount of mortgage insurance we write 
these alternatives include origination of mortgages consisting of two simultaneous loans  known as simultaneous seconds  comprising a first mortgage with a loan to value ratio of and a simultaneous second mortgage for the excess portion of the loan  instead of a single mortgage with a loan to value ratio of more than 
over the past several years  the volume of simultaneous second loans as an alternative to loans requiring private mortgage insurance has increased substantially  using government mortgage insurance programs  including those of the fha  the va and cmhc  holding mortgages in the lenders own loan portfolios and self insuring  using programs  such as those offered by fannie mae and freddie mac  requiring lower mortgage insurance coverage levels  originating and securitizing loans in mortgage backed securities whose underlying mortgages are not insured with private mortgage insurance or which are structured so that the risk of default lies with the investor  rather than a private mortgage insurer  and using credit default swaps or similar instruments  instead of private mortgage insurance  to transfer credit risk on mortgages 

table of contents a decline in the use of private mortgage insurance in connection with high loan to value home mortgages for any reason would reduce the demand for flow mortgage insurance 
we believe in recent quarters there has been a reduction in this demand in part as the result of increasing originations of mortgages that do not meet the eligibility requirements of fannie mae and freddie mac and mortgages that are securitized in mortgage backed securities that do not use private mortgage insurance 
a prolonged decline of this nature could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our claims expenses would increase and our results of operations would suffer if the rate of defaults on mortgages covered by our mortgage insurance increases or the severity of such defaults exceeds our expectations 
our premium rates vary with the perceived risk of a claim on the insured loan  which takes into account factors such as the loan to value ratio  our long term historical loss experience  whether the mortgage provides for fixed payments or variable payments  the term of the mortgage  the borrower s credit history and the level of documentation and verification of the borrower s income and assets 
our ability to properly determine eligibility and accurate pricing for the mortgage insurance we issue is dependent upon our underwriting and other operational routines 
these routines may vary across the jurisdictions in which we do business 
deficiencies in actual practice in this area could have an adverse impact on our results 
we establish renewal premium rates for the life of a mortgage insurance policy upon issuance  and we cannot cancel the policy or adjust the premiums after the policy is issued 
as a result  we cannot offset the impact of unanticipated claims with premium increases on policies in force  and we cannot refuse to renew mortgage insurance coverage 
the premiums we agree to charge upon writing a mortgage insurance policy may not adequately compensate us for the risks and costs associated with the coverage we provide for the entire life of that policy 
the long term profitability of our mortgage insurance business depends upon the accuracy of our pricing assumptions and availability and reliability of underwriting data  which may vary across jurisdictions 
if defaults on mortgages increase because of an economic downturn or for reasons we failed to take into account adequately  we would be required to make greater claim payments than we planned when we priced our policies 
future claims on our mortgage insurance policies may not match the assumptions made in our pricing 
an increase in the amount or frequency of claims beyond the levels contemplated by our pricing assumptions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in recent years  our results of operations have benefited from historically low loss ratios because of significant home price appreciation and low levels of defaults 
increases from these recent historic lows could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   approximately of our us mortgage insurance risk in force and of our international mortgage insurance risk in force had not yet reached its anticipated highest claim frequency years  which are generally between the third and seventh year of the loan 
as a result  we expect our loss experience on these loans will increase as policies continue to age 
if the claim frequency on the risk in force significantly exceeds the claim frequency that was assumed in setting premium rates  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected 
in our us mortgage insurance business  we also provide mortgage insurance for alt a loans  loans with an initial interest only payment option and other non traditional loans 
alt a loans are originated under programs in which there is a reduced level of verification or disclosure of the borrower s income or assets 
alt a loans typically have a higher default rate than fully documented loans  and we generally charge higher premiums for mortgage insurance on alt a loans than on fully documented loans 
the interest only payment option allows the borrower flexibility to pay interest only or pay interest and as much principal as desired  during an initial period of time 
we impose credit score  occupancy type and loan to value restrictions on these loans 
although historical information is limited  we believe interest only loans may pose a higher risk of claims due to features such as deferred amortization of the loan 
if defaults on alt a or interest only or other non traditional loans 
table of contents are higher than the assumptions we made in pricing our mortgage insurance on those loans  then we would be required to make greater claims payments than we had projected  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
a deterioration in economic conditions or a decline in home price appreciation may adversely affect our loss experience in mortgage insurance 
losses in our mortgage insurance business generally result from events  such as reduction of income  unemployment  divorce  illness and inability to manage credit and interest rate levels that reduce a borrower s ability to continue to make mortgage payments 
the amount of the loss we suffer  if any  depends in part on whether the home of a borrower who defaults on a mortgage can be sold for an amount that will cover unpaid principal and interest and the expenses of the sale 
a deterioration in economic conditions generally increases the likelihood that borrowers will not have sufficient income to pay their mortgages and can also adversely affect housing values  which increases our risk of loss 
a decline in home price appreciation  whether or not in conjunction with deteriorating economic conditions  may also increase our risk of loss 
a substantial economic downturn  or decline in recent significant home price appreciation across the entire us or globally could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we also may be particularly affected by economic downturns or declines in recent significant home price appreciation in states where a large portion of our business is concentrated 
as of december   approximately of our us risk in force was concentrated in states with in florida  in texas and in new york 
similarly  our mortgage insurance operations in canada  australia and europe are concentrated primarily in or around the largest cities in those countries 
continued and prolonged adverse economic conditions or declines in recent significant home price appreciation in these states or cities could result in high levels of claims and losses  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
a significant portion of our risk in force consists of loans with high loan to value ratios  which generally result in more and larger claims than loans with lower loan to value ratios 
mortgage loans with higher loan to value ratios typically have claim incidence rates substantially higher than mortgage loans with lower loan to value ratios 
in canada  australia  and new zealand  the risks of having a portfolio with a significant portion of high loan to value mortgages are greater than in the us and europe because we generally agree to cover of the losses associated with mortgage defaults in those markets  compared to percentages in the us and europe that are typically to of the loan amount 
although mortgage insurance premiums for higher loan to value ratio loans generally are higher than for loans with lower loan to value ratios  the difference in premium rates may not be sufficient to compensate us for the enhanced risks associated with mortgage loans bearing higher loan to value ratios 
we cede a portion of our us mortgage insurance business to mortgage reinsurance companies affiliated with our mortgage lending customers  and this reduces our profitability 
we  like other mortgage insurers  offer opportunities to our mortgage lending customers that are designed to allow them to participate in the risks and rewards of the mortgage insurance business 
many of the major mortgage lenders with which we do business have established captive mortgage reinsurance subsidiaries 
these reinsurance subsidiaries assume a portion of the risks associated with the lender s insured mortgage loans in exchange for a percentage of the premiums 
in most cases  our reinsurance coverage is an excess of loss arrangement with a limited band of exposure for the reinsurer 
this means that we are required to pay the first layer of losses arising from defaults in the covered mortgages  the reinsurer indemnifies us for the next layer of losses  and we pay any losses in excess of the reinsurer s obligations 
the effect of these arrangements historically has been a reduction in the profitability and return on capital of this business to us 
approximately of our us primary new risk written as of december  was subject to captive mortgage reinsurance  compared to approximately as of december  us premiums ceded to these reinsurers were 
table of contents approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these premium cessions have adversely affected our profitability and could further reduce profitability if the terms of these arrangements require greater premium cessions 
we compete with government owned and government sponsored entities in our mortgage insurance business  and this may put us at a competitive disadvantage on pricing and other terms and conditions 
our mortgage insurance business competes with many different government owned and government sponsored entities in the us  canada and some european countries 
in the us  these entities include principally the fha and  to a lesser degree  the va  fannie mae and freddie mac  as well as local and state housing finance agencies 
in canada  we compete with the cmhc  a crown corporation owned by the canadian government 
in europe  these entities include public mortgage guarantee facilities in a number of countries 
those competitors may establish pricing terms and business practices that may be influenced by motives such as advancing social housing policy or stabilizing the mortgage lending industry  which may not be consistent with maximizing return on capital or other profitability measures 
in addition  those governmental entities typically do not have the same capital requirements that we and other mortgage insurance companies have and therefore may have financial flexibility in their pricing and capacity that could put us at a competitive disadvantage in some respects 
in the event that a government owned or sponsored entity in one of our markets determines to reduce prices significantly or alter the terms and conditions of its mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement products in furtherance of social or other goals rather than a profit motive  we may be unable to compete in that market effectively  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we compete in canada with the cmhc  which is owned by the canadian government and  as a sovereign entity  provides mortgage lenders with capital relief from bank regulatory requirements on loans that it insures 
in contrast  lenders receive only capital relief on loans we insure 
cmhc also operates the canadian mortgage bond program  which provides lenders the ability to efficiently guaranty and securitize their mortgage loan portfolios 
if we are unable to effectively distinguish ourselves competitively with our canadian mortgage lender customers  we may be unable to compete effectively with the cmhc as a result of the more favorable capital relief it can provide or the other products and incentives that it offers to lenders 
changes in regulations that affect the mortgage insurance business could affect our operations significantly and could reduce the demand for mortgage insurance 
in addition to the general regulatory risks that are described above under our insurance businesses are heavily regulated  and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth  we are also affected by various additional regulations relating particularly to our mortgage insurance operations 
us federal and state regulations affect the scope of our competitors operations  which has an effect on the size of the mortgage insurance market and the intensity of the competition in our mortgage insurance business 
this competition includes not only other private mortgage insurers  but also us federal and state governmental and quasi governmental agencies  principally the fha  and to a lesser degree  the va  which are governed by federal regulations 
increases in the maximum loan amount that the fha can insure  and reductions in the mortgage insurance premiums the fha charges  can reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance 
the fha has also streamlined its down payment formula and made fha insurance more competitive with private mortgage insurance in areas with higher home prices 
these and other legislative and regulatory changes could cause demand for private mortgage insurance to decrease 
our us mortgage insurance business  as a credit enhancement provider in the residential mortgage lending industry  also is subject to compliance with various federal and state consumer protection and insurance laws  including the real estate settlement procedures act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair housing act  the 
table of contents homeowners protection act  the federal fair credit reporting act  the fair debt collection practices act and others 
among other things  these laws prohibit payments for referrals of settlement service business  require fairness and non discrimination in granting or facilitating the granting of credit  require cancellation of insurance and refund of unearned premiums under certain circumstances  govern the circumstances under which companies may obtain and use consumer credit information  and define the manner in which companies may pursue collection activities 
changes in these laws or regulations could adversely affect the operations and profitability of our mortgage insurance business 
for example  the department of housing and urban development was considering a rule that would exempt certain mortgages that provide a single price for a package of settlement services from the prohibition in respa against payments for referrals of settlement service business 
if mortgage insurance were included among the settlement services that  when offered as a package  would be exempt from this prohibition  then mortgage lenders would have greater leverage in obtaining business concessions from mortgage insurers 
in may  the office of thrift supervision amended its capital regulations to remove the loan to value standard from the definition of qualifying mortgage loan  instead incorporating the federal interagency guidelines for real estate lending  which do not contain an explicit loan to value standard but provide that an institution should require credit enhancement for a loan with a loan to value equal to or exceeding 
the capital regulations assign a lower risk weight to qualifying mortgage loans than to non qualifying loans 
as a result  these amended regulations no longer penalize ots regulated institutions for retaining loans that have loan to value ratios between and without credit enhancements 
other regulators  including the us federal deposit insurance corporation  also do not explicitly refer to a loan to value standard but do refer to the interagency guidelines 
regulations in canada require the use of mortgage insurance for all mortgage loans extended by banks  trust companies and insurers with loan to value ratios greater than 
in november  as a result of a periodic review of the federal financial services regulatory framework  the canadian government introduced a bill on setting out a wide variety of changes to the regulations of financial services  including increasing the statutory requirement for mortgage insurance on all loans with loan to value ratios from ltv to greater than ltv 
this may result in a reduction in the amount of business we write in future years in canada 
the canadian department of finance has informed us that they intend to review the guarantee agreement with the canadian government and target completion of this by the end of although we believe the canadian government will preserve the guarantee and maintain competition in the canadian mortgage industry  we cannot be sure what  if any  changes will be made to the terms of the guarantee 
the failure of the canadian government to maintain the guarantee on terms similar to the current guarantee could have an adverse effect on our ability to offer mortgage insurance products in canada and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
apra regulates all financial institutions in australia  including general  life and mortgage insurance companies 
apra also determines the minimum regulatory capital requirements for depository institutions 
apra s current regulations provide for reduced capital requirements for depository institutions that insure residential mortgages with loan to value ratios above in the case of standard loans and  from october   with loan to value ratios above in the case of non standard type loans 
apra s regulations currently require apra regulated lenders to determine the criteria for determining if a loan is a non standard type loan within certain parameters determined by apra 
under proposed rules released by apra during in connection with the basel ii framework  certain approved deposit taking institutions adis in australia would be required to hold less capital on high loan to value mortgage loans and would also receive a capital incentive for using mortgage insurance  but at a reduced level when compared to current regulations in australia 
apra has also proposed that adis would need to acquire mortgage insurance coverage levels lower than existing requirements in order to obtain these reduced capital incentives 
we continue to work with apra on this proposed rulemaking  which is expected to become 
table of contents effective january  if the final rules retain these provisions  lenders in australia may be able to reduce their use of mortgage insurance for high loan to value ratio mortgages  which may have an adverse affect on our australian business 
we believe the revisions to a set of regulatory rules and procedures governing global bank capital standards that were introduced by the basel committee of the bank for international settlements  known as basel ii  may encourage growth of international mortgage insurance 
basel ii has been designed to reward banks that have developed effective risk management systems by allowing them to hold less capital than banks with less effective systems 
basel ii was finalized and issued in june  however  its adoption by individual countries internationally and in the us is ongoing 
therefore  we cannot predict the benefits that ultimately will be provided to lenders  or how any such benefits may affect the opportunities for the growth of mortgage insurance 
if countries implement basel ii in a manner that does not reward lenders for using mortgage insurance as a credit risk mitigant on high loan to value mortgage loans  or if lenders conclude that mortgage insurance does not provide sufficient capital incentives  then we may have to revise our product offerings to meet the new requirements and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
our us mortgage insurance business could be adversely affected by legal actions under respa 
respa prohibits paying lenders for the referral of settlement services  including mortgage insurance 
this precludes us from providing services to mortgage lenders free of charge  charging fees for services that are lower than their reasonable or fair market value  and paying fees for services that others provide that are higher than their reasonable or fair market value 
in addition  respa prohibits persons from giving or accepting any portion or percentage of a charge for a real estate settlement service  other than for services actually performed 
a number of lawsuits  including some that were class actions  have challenged the actions of private mortgage insurers  including our company  under respa  alleging that the insurers have provided or received products or services at improperly set prices in return for the referral of mortgage insurance 
we and several other mortgage insurers  without admitting any wrongdoing  reached a settlement in these cases 
we cannot predict whether plaintiffs will institute new litigation against private mortgage insurers  including us  seeking damages or under relief under respa 
in addition  us federal and state officials are authorized to enforce respa and to seek civil and criminal penalties  and we cannot predict whether these proceedings might be brought against us or other mortgage insurers 
any such proceedings could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
potential liabilities in connection with our us contract underwriting services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we offer contract underwriting services to many of our mortgage lenders in the us  pursuant to which our employees and contractors work directly with the lender to determine whether the data relating to a borrower and a proposed loan contained in a mortgage loan application file complies with the lender s loan underwriting guidelines or the investor s loan purchase requirements 
in connection with that service  we also compile the application data and submit it to the automated underwriting systems of fannie mae and freddie mac  which independently analyze the data to determine if the proposed loan complies with their investor requirements 
under the terms of our contract underwriting agreements  we agree to indemnify the lender against losses incurred in the event that we make material errors in determining whether loans processed by our contract underwriters meet specified underwriting or purchase criteria  subject to contractual limitations on liability 
as a result  we assume credit and interest rate risk in connection with our contract underwriting services 
worsening economic conditions  a deterioration in the quality of our underwriting services or other factors could cause our contract underwriting liabilities to increase and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
although we have established reserves to provide for potential claims in connection with our contract underwriting services  we have limited historical experience that we can use to establish reserves for these potential liabilities  and these reserves may not be adequate to cover liabilities that may arise 

table of contents if the european and other mortgage insurance markets do not grow as we expect  we will not be able to execute our strategy to expand our business into these markets 
we have devoted resources to marketing our mortgage insurance products in europe and other parts of the world  and we plan to continue these efforts 
our growth strategy depends partly upon the development of favorable legislative and regulatory policies throughout europe that support increased homeownership and provide capital relief for institutions that insure their mortgage loan portfolios with private mortgage insurance 
in furtherance of these policies  we have collaborated with government agencies to develop bank regulatory capital requirements that provide incentives to lenders to implement risk transfer strategies such as mortgage insurance  as well as governmental policies that encourage homeownership as a wealth accumulation strategy for borrowers with limited resources to make large down payments 
we have invested  and we will continue to invest  significant resources to advocate such a regulatory environment at the national and regional levels 
however  if legislative and regulatory agencies fail to adopt these policies  then these markets for high loan to value lending and mortgage insurance may not expand as we currently anticipate  and our growth strategy in those markets may not be successful 
other risks we have agreed to make payments to ge based on the projected amounts of certain tax savings we expect to realize as a result of the ipo 
we will remain obligated to make these payments even if we do not realize the related tax savings and the payments could be accelerated in the event of certain changes in control 
we entered into a tax matters agreement with ge in connection with the ipo 
we refer to this agreement as the tax matters agreement 
under the tax matters agreement  we have an obligation to pay ge a fixed amount over approximately the next years 
this fixed obligation  the estimated present values of which were million and million as of december  and  respectively  equals subject to a cumulative million maximum amount of the tax savings projected as a result of the ipo 
even if we fail to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the projected tax savings  we will remain obligated to pay ge  and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 
we could also  subject to regulatory approval  be required to pay ge on an accelerated basis in the event of certain changes in control of our company 
in connection with the sale of our group life and health insurance business previously mentioned  we are required to pay ge approximately million pursuant to the tax matters agreement at or prior to the closing of the sale 
this payout represents accelerated tax benefits 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws and our tax matters agreement with ge may discourage takeover attempts and business combinations that stockholders might consider in their best interests 
our certificate of incorporation and by laws include provisions that may have anti takeover effects and may delay  deter or prevent a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests 
for example  our certificate of incorporation and by laws permit our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock  limit the ability of stockholders to remove directors  limit the ability of stockholders to fill vacancies on our board of directors  limit the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders and take action by written consent  and impose advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at stockholder meetings 
under our tax matters agreement with ge  if any person or group of persons other than ge or its affiliates gains the power to direct the management and policies of our company  we could become obligated immediately 
table of contents to pay to ge the total present value of all remaining tax benefit payments due to ge over the full term of the agreement 
the estimated present value of our fixed obligation as of december  was million 
similarly  if any person or group of persons other than us or our affiliates gains effective control of one of our subsidiaries  we could become obligated to pay to ge the total present value of all such payments due to ge allocable to that subsidiary  unless the subsidiary assumes the obligation to pay these future amounts under the tax matters agreement and certain conditions are met 
the acceleration of payments would be subject to the approval of certain state insurance regulators  and we are obligated to use our reasonable best efforts to seek these approvals 
this feature of the agreement could adversely affect a potential merger or sale of our company 
it could also limit our flexibility to dispose of one or more of our subsidiaries  with adverse implications for any business strategy dependent on such dispositions

item properties we own our headquarters facility in richmond  virginia  which consists of approximately  square feet in four buildings  as well as several facilities in lynchburg  virginia with approximately  square feet 
in addition  we lease approximately  square feet of office space in locations throughout the us we also own two buildings outside the us with approximately  square feet  and we lease approximately  square feet in locations outside the us most of our leases in the us and other countries have lease terms of three to five years  although some leases have terms of up to years 
our aggregate annual rental expense under all these leases was million during the year ended december  we believe our properties are adequate for our business as presently conducted 

table of contents item legal proceedings we face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses  including the risk of class action lawsuits 
our pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to us and others generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate 
in our insurance operations  we are  have been  or may become subject to class actions and individual suits alleging  among other things  issues relating to sales or underwriting practices  payment of contingent or other sales commissions  bidding practices in connection with our management and administration of a third party s municipal guaranteed investment contract business  claims payments and procedures  product design  product disclosure  administration  additional premium charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis  denial or delay of benefits  charging excessive or impermissible fees on products  recommending unsuitable products to customers  our pricing structures and business practices in our mortgage insurance business  such as capital reinsurance arrangements with lenders and contract underwriting services  violations of respa or related state anti inducement laws  and breaching fiduciary or other duties to customers 
plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large or indeterminate amounts  including punitive and treble damages  which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
in our investment related operations  we are subject to litigation involving commercial disputes with counterparties 
we are also subject to litigation arising out of our general business activities such as our contractual and employment relationships 
we are also subject to various regulatory inquiries  such as information requests  subpoenas and books and record examinations  from state  federal and international regulators and other authorities 
a substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation  regulatory action or investigation  we could suffer significant reputational harm  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
recently  the insurance industry has become the focus of increased scrutiny by regulatory and law enforcement authorities concerning certain practices within the insurance industry 
in this regard  in may  we received a subpoena from the northeast regional office of the sec  requiring the production of documents related to certain loss mitigation insurance products  such as finite risk reinsurance
