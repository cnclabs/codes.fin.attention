item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations covers periods prior and subsequent to the dynamit nobel acquisition consummated on july  in connection with the dynamit nobel acquisition  we entered into new financing arrangements and significantly altered our capital structure 
the historical financial information of rockwood during the periods prior to the dynamit nobel acquisition included in this annual report does not reflect the significant impact the dynamit nobel acquisition has had on us 
the results of operations of the dynamit nobel businesses for the periods ended subsequent to july  are included in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and the groupe novasep combination was completed on december  see note  acquisitions  however  no results of operations are reflected in our income statement for the year ended december  the results of operations and cash flows of the rheological additives and carbonless developers businesses of s d chemie ag are not included in the twelve month period ended december  as the acquisition was completed on december  on january   we completed the sale of our groupe novasep segment 
as a result  our consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to reflect the groupe novasep segment as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
see note  discontinued operations  for further details 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties  including those set forth under item  business forward looking statements and item a  risk factors 
you should read the following discussion and analysis together with item  selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
amounts may not recalculate due to rounding differences 
given the significance of the dynamit nobel acquisition  we have included a limited discussion of the results of our operations on a pro forma basis as if the dynamit nobel acquisition had taken place on january  see pro forma net sales  income loss before taxes and adjusted ebitda below 
the results of operations on a pro forma basis also assumes the pigments and dispersions acquisition and the groupe novasep combination had also taken place on january  general we are a global developer  manufacturer and marketer of technologically advanced  high value added specialty chemicals and advanced materials 
we serve more than  customers across a wide variety of industries and geographic areas 
we operate through six business segments specialty chemicals  performance additives  titanium dioxide pigments  advanced ceramics  specialty compounds  and electronics 
of these six segments  we acquired specialty chemicals  titanium dioxide pigments and advanced ceramics in the dynamit nobel acquisition 
our net sales consist of sales of our products  net of sales discounts  product returns and allowances 
sales are primarily made on a purchase order basis 
our cost of products sold consists of variable and fixed components 
our variable costs are proportional to volume and consist principally of raw materials  packaging and related supplies  certain energy costs  and certain distribution costs including inbound  outbound  and internal shipping and transfer costs 
our fixed costs are not significantly impacted by production volume and consist principally of certain fixed manufacturing costs and other distribution network costs  including warehousing 
fixed manufacturing costs comprise headcount related costs and overhead  including depreciation  periodic maintenance costs  purchasing and receiving costs  inspection costs and certain energy costs 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include research and development costs  sales and marketing  divisional management expenses and corporate services including cash management  legal  benefit plan administration and other administrative and professional services 
we financed the dynamit nobel acquisition primarily through the proceeds of net equity investments of million from kkr and dljmb  term loans of approximately  million and a senior subordinated loan facility of approximately million  as described in detail under liquidity and capital resources below 
we later refinanced significant portions of this indebtedness with indebtedness bearing lower interest rates 
nonetheless  as a result of the dynamit nobel acquisition  our interest expense currently is  and will continue to be  higher than it was prior to the dynamit nobel acquisition 
as a result of the repayment of debt in connection with the ipo  interest expense will be lower than it was prior to the ipo 
we are focused on growth  productivity  cost reduction  margin expansion and debt reduction 
in connection with this focus  among other things we have cut costs  reduced overhead and eliminated duplicative positions in both acquired and existing businesses 
for example  during the first quarter of  we closed facilities in the united states and the uk in our wafer reclaim business in our electronics segment 
we have also announced the consolidation in of several uk facilities resulting from the recent acquisition by our specialty compounds segment 
we also implemented other restructuring measures in our other segments  including the closure of our baulking  uk facility in our clay based additives business  we reduced our net working capital as a percentage of net sales by implementing more effective systems to monitor working capital  augmenting further our just in time inventory management and creating incentives for managers to focus on working capital management  we implemented stringent controls to help ensure that maintenance capital expenditures are appropriate and that expansion capital is in line with both capacity and market demands 
we closely monitor capital expenditures in all of our segments  and we completed the sale of our groupe novasep subsidiary in january and our united states wafer reclaim business in february factors which affect our results of operations our markets because the businesses in our segments generally serve many unrelated end use markets  we discuss the principal market conditions on a segment basis rather than a consolidated basis 
the principal market conditions in our segments and regions in which we operate that impacted our results of operations during the periods presented include the following specialty chemicals demand for surface treatment products in our specialty chemicals segment generally follows the activity levels of metal processing manufacturers  including the automotive supply  steel and aerospace industries 
in  we benefited from a growth in demand for most of the markets and regions we serve  especially in the aerospace and automotive industry which continued in despite the less favorable automotive conditions in the us  we have been able to sustain sales growth in our global automotive business due to market penetration as our business primarily focuses on the european automobile industry market 
growth in the surface treatment business occurred in in all markets and regions served  especially in the aerospace and coil industries  as price and volume increases offset raw material cost increases 
we expect the surface treatment business to grow in in all markets as price and volume increases are expected to offset raw material cost increases and higher personnel costs to support the continuing growth of the business 
demand for our lithium products in the fine chemicals business line of our specialty chemicals segment is generally driven by demand for lithium carbonate in industrial applications  the aluminum business  glass ceramics  cement and the general demand in china 
sales of lithium products specifically used in life science applications depend on the trends in drug development and growth in pharmaceuticals markets as well as generic competition 
market conditions for lithium products in the industries served provided increasing price trends for lithium salts in and growth in the fine chemicals business occurred in in most market segments  especially driven by lithium salt applications through price increases and strong demand for lithium applications  particularly sales of butyllithium  specialty products to the pharmaceutical industry and lithium battery products 
tight supplies in the global market and unfavorable weather conditions at the lithium ponds in chile in early led to shortages in lithium salts as a raw material and customer demand for lithium carbonate was not completely satisfied 
although we expect shortages for lithium carbonate to continue for  growth in the fine chemicals business is expected in all market segments  particularly driven by lithium salt applications through price increases and higher demand for lithium specialties 
performance additives although the growth in demand in the north american construction market in general has slowed  sales in our color pigments and services business in north america increased in on higher construction volumes and selling price increases that were necessary to recover raw material and energy cost increases 
generally  a continuing trend towards the increased use of colored concrete products in the north american construction market has had a positive effect on our color pigments and services business line 
growth in north america in is expected in all markets  especially in the construction market on higher volumes and selling price increases to offset raw material and energy cost increases 
demand for treated wood was negatively impacted in by the increasing use of wood substitutes and we expect this trend to continue in demand in certain european end use markets over the last few years has slowed 
this affected sales of color pigments and services in the construction market and  as a result  we experienced a decrease in european construction volumes in our color pigments and services business in and european construction sales in our color pigments and services business increased slightly in as the higher selling prices necessary to recover raw material and energy cost increases offset lower volumes 
european construction sales in are expected to increase on higher selling prices and increased volumes resulting from a stronger european economy 
the change in the market to environmentally advanced wood treatment chemical products  such as acq  and the phase out of chromated copper arsenate  or cca  for residential use had a positive impact on our timber treatment chemicals business in  which is a leading supplier of these higher margin products 
however  in the timber treatment chemicals business  our acq market position was negatively impacted in by some customer losses and competitive pricing pressure 
in addition  the expiration of the acq patent in may could have a negative impact on our acq market position  sales and margins 
our clay based additives business supplies specialty rheology modifiers and additives  both clay based and synthetic  to a variety of end use markets 
for  the major drivers of growth in the clay based additives business have been the acquisition of s d chemie s rheological additives and carbonless clay businesses  continued strength in oilfield sales and growth in additives for water based coatings 
growth is expected in from continued strength in oilfield  coatings and inks sales 
raw material costs have increased in general in the performance additives segment since and continue to trend upward 
in the color pigments and services business  selling price increases were initiated to partially offset the increases in raw material and energy costs and we expect to continue to implement increases in in  the timber treatment chemicals business experienced record high costs for copper  a primary component in the acq production process 
costs of mono ethanolamine were also higher in the business was unable to pass on these increased material costs to customers in  but selling price increases are expected to be implemented in to partially offset raw material cost increases 
in the clay based additives business  price increases were implemented in in selective product lines and continued in in a majority of product lines to partially offset energy and raw material cost increases 
further price increases are expected in as needed to offset any additional increases in raw material and energy costs 
titanium dioxide pigments demand for our titanium dioxide products in anatase grade is driven mainly by demand in the synthetic fiber industry  while demand for titanium dioxide products in rutile grade and our functional additives is driven by demand in the coatings  paper and plastics industries 
we experienced an unexpected decrease in volume of our titanium dioxide products in anatase grade in due  in part  to the lower cost of cotton  which negatively affected demand for synthetic fibers and in turn our products 
volumes and selling prices in the fiber anatase business increased in and are expected to continue to increase in our functional additives business increased in on higher selling prices and volumes  which is expected to continue in throughout and  we experienced pricing pressure from global suppliers in asia  specifically chinese suppliers related to titanium dioxide products in anatase grade 
we also experienced pricing pressures on our titanium products in rutile grade 
sales of titanium dioxide products in rutile grade were down slightly in as lower volumes were partially offset by higher selling prices 
sales of titanium dioxide products in rutile grade are expected to increase in on higher volumes and some selling price increases 
advanced ceramics demand for our ceramic medical devices is mainly tied to the aging population in europe and the united states 
as a result of this demographic as well as our market share penetration  the volume of our products used in medical device applications sold has experienced double digit growth each year from through however  in some customers in the us reduced their demand due to high inventory levels and delayed approvals 
as a result  demand stabilized which resulted in lower volumes in growth of our medical device applications is expected in on higher volumes and slightly higher selling prices 
sales of ceramic products for use in cutting tool products and mechanical systems were higher in as volume increases were partially offset by the negative impact of pricing pressure from asian competitors 
growth of ceramic products for use in cutting tool products and mechanical systems is expected in on higher volumes and increased market share 
selling prices in our electronic products business as well as for some piezo applications were lower in in  sales of our electronics products business is expected to decrease on lower volumes 
sales of our piezo applications are expected to be higher in from increased volumes partially offset by continued lower selling prices for tape related products 
specialty compounds our largest product line in the specialty compounds segment is wire and cable compounds 
sales within this product line are dependent upon the telecommunications market and related sectors  specifically demand for high end voice and data communication wire and cable  for which our specialty compounds segment is a significant provider of sheathing materials 
sales for these wire and cable products were up slightly in and are expected to be higher in primarily due to the acquisition of the megolon division of scapa group  plc 
newly developed non halogen products for wire and cable data communication  military and other applications have expanded business in north america and created opportunities in europe 
most of the other end use markets for which specialty compounds products are used generally track growth of gross domestic product  but many are also application specific  such as automotive 
our net sales in medical and regulated packaging and consumer industrial thermoplastic elastomers were up in expectations are for continued growth in these markets for we are focusing more of our efforts towards increasing high margin specialty products  in particular  thermoplastic elastomers  and less of our efforts in automotive and footwear 
the price of ammonium octamolybdate aom and polyvinyl chloride pvc resin and plasticizers  key raw materials used in the production of wire and cable products  have increased since selling price increases were successfully initiated in and to help offset the raw materials price increase to help compensate for the higher raw material costs 
raw material prices are not expected to be as volatile in electronics demand for our electronics products generally follows the activity levels of semiconductor and printed circuit board manufacturers 
the global semiconductor and printed circuit board pcb markets are cyclical in nature 
worldwide sales of semiconductors increased in and we expect sales to continue to rise in driven by strong demand for consumer electronics  including cell phones and pc s 
the printed circuit board industry in the united states and europe declined in  but improved in  while the market in asia experienced significant growth during this period 
despite the declines in the united states and europe in  volumes in our electronic chemicals business increased in and  particularly in asia  which provides nearly half of the global market 
we expect this trend to continue in the price of certain of our products is insulated to some degree from the effect of changes in the price of semiconductors and printed circuit boards due to the fact that the cost of these products is generally a small component of the cost of the end product 
despite this  we have experienced pricing pressure in certain businesses  particularly with respect to photomasks in europe due to very aggressive competition 
we expect that this pricing pressure will continue during global exposure we operate a geographically diverse business 
of our net sales  were shipments to europe  to north america predominantly the united states and to the rest of the world 
for a geographic description of the origin of our net sales and location of our long lived assets  see note  segment information 
we estimate that we sold to customers in more than countries during this period 
currently  we serve our diverse and extensive customer base with manufacturing facilities in countries 
consequently  we are exposed to global economic and political changes  particularly currency fluctuations that could impact our profitability 
our sales and production costs are mainly denominated in us dollars or euros 
our results of operations and financial condition have been historically impacted by the fluctuation of the euro against our reporting currency  the us dollar 
for the twelve months ended december   the average exchange rate of the euro against the us dollar was higher compared to the same period in as a result  our net sales  gross profit and operating income were positively impacted 
historically  however  our operating margins have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuations because  in general  sales and costs of products sold are generated or incurred in the same currency  subject to certain exceptions 
raw materials raw materials constituted approximately of our cost of products sold 
we have a broad raw material base  with the cost of no single raw material representing more than of our cost of products sold in nonetheless  the significant price fluctuations our raw materials have experienced in the past during periods of high demand have had an adverse impact on our results of operations 
in particular  record high prices for copper used in the timber treatment chemicals business of our performance additives segment had a negative impact on results in we cannot accurately predict the impact of any future price increases for raw materials or any raw material shortages on our business as a whole or in specific geographic regions 
in addition  we may not be able to pass on raw material price increases to our customers 
energy costs in  energy purchases represented approximately of our cost of products sold 
however  within certain business lines  such as our titanium dioxide pigments segment and the color pigments and services and clay based additives businesses of our performance additives segment  energy costs are more significant 
the cost of products sold for certain of our businesses  including color pigments and services and clay based additives  increases when the price of natural gas in north america rises 
natural gas prices were volatile and continued to increase in north america in in contrast  natural gas prices in europe  where our titanium dioxide pigments segment is located  have historically been relatively stable  although prices were higher in income taxes as of december   the company has us federal and foreign corporate tax loss carryforwards excluding state and local amounts of approximately million  of which million expire in years through and of which million have no current expiration date 
included in the us federal and foreign carryforwards are us federal tax loss carryforwards of million  of which million expire in and beyond 
the company also has state and local tax loss carryforwards of approximately million expiring in years through the company has increased its worldwide valuation allowance during by million  from million on a continuing operations basis to million primarily due to increases in the us valuation allowance due to the increase in us deferred tax assets 
the increase consists of million recorded to goodwill in connection with prior year acquisitions  million recorded to other comprehensive income and recorded as an expense to continuing operations 
the remainder relates to foreign currency fluctuations 
acquisitions during the periods presented  we made acquisitions pursuant to our business strategy of achieving profitable growth 
see note  acquisitions  for further details 
special charges and credits during the periods presented  we incurred certain special charges  along with certain other items  substantially in connection with the establishment of the post acquisition corporate entity that incorporates the business segments acquired in the dynamit nobel acquisition as well as in connection with the ipo 
these items include systems organization establishment expenses  restructuring and related charges  foreign exchange gains and losses and inventory write up reversals 
see items excluded from adjusted ebitda section in note  segment information  for a discussion of special charges and credits recorded in the years ended december   and special note regarding non gaap financial measures a non gaap financial measure is generally defined by the sec as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable us gaap measure 
from time to time in this management s discussion and analysis  we disclose non gaap financial measures  primarily adjusted ebitda  as defined below 
definition of adjusted ebitda the presentation of consolidated adjusted ebitda contained in this report is calculated using the definition set forth in the senior secured credit agreement as a basis and reflects management s interpretations thereof  including treatment of discontinued operations 
adjusted ebitda  which is referred to under the senior secured credit agreement as consolidated ebitda  is defined in the senior secured credit agreement as consolidated earnings which  as defined in the senior secured credit agreement  equals income loss before the deduction of income taxes of rockwood specialties group  inc and the restricted subsidiaries as such term is defined in the senior secured credit agreement  excluding extraordinary items plus interest expense  depreciation expense  amortization expense  including amortization of deferred financing fees  extraordinary losses and non recurring charges  non cash charges  losses on asset sales  restructuring charges or reserves including severance  relocation costs and one time compensation charges and costs relating to the closure of facilities  expenses paid by us or any of our subsidiaries in connection with the dynamit nobel acquisition  the senior secured credit agreement  the granting of liens under the security documents as such term is defined in the senior secured credit agreement  the indenture governing the notes and the offering of the notes and any other related transactions  any expenses or charges incurred in connection with any issuance of debt or equity securities  any fees and expenses related to permitted acquisitions  any deduction for minority interest expense  and items arising in connection with cca litigation related to our timber treatment chemicals business of our performance additives segment  less extraordinary gains and non recurring gains  non cash gains  and gains on asset sales  in all cases  subject to certain exclusions 
for presentation purposes within this report  we use the computation set forth in our senior secured credit agreement as a basis which reflects management s interpretations thereof  including treatment of discontinued operations 
specifically  calculation of adjusted ebitda according to the indentures underlying our notes and notes excludes certain adjustments prescribed within the senior secured credit agreement 
given that borrowings under the senior secured credit agreement are secured by most of our assets and given that the calculation does not materially differ from the calculation of adjusted ebitda for performance measurement purposes  we believe this is the most appropriate computation of adjusted ebitda to present 
management s uses we use adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis to assess our operating performance 
we believe this financial measure on a consolidated basis is helpful in highlighting trends in our overall business because the items excluded in calculating adjusted ebitda have been deemed by management to have little or no bearing on our day to day operating performance 
it is also the most significant criterion in our calculation of performance based cash bonuses and our determination of whether certain performance based stock options vest  both of which are tied to adjusted ebitda targets 
we also use adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis as a liquidity measure 
we believe this financial measure on a consolidated basis is important in analyzing our liquidity because our senior secured credit agreement and indentures governing the notes and notes contain financial covenants that are determined based on adjusted ebitda 
these covenants are material terms of these agreements  because they govern substantially all of our long term debt  which in turn represents a substantial portion of our capitalization 
non compliance with these financial covenants under our senior secured credit facilities our maximum total leverage ratio and our minimum interest coverage ratio  in particular could result in the lenders requiring us to immediately repay all amounts borrowed 
any such acceleration could also lead to the noteholders accelerating the maturity of the notes and the notes 
in addition  if we cannot satisfy these financial covenants in the indentures governing the notes and notes  we cannot engage in certain activities  such as incurring additional indebtedness or making certain payments 
consequently  adjusted ebitda is critical to our assessment of our liquidity 
we also use adjusted ebitda on a segment basis as the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate the ongoing performance of our business segments and reporting units 
on a segment basis  we define adjusted ebitda as operating income excluding depreciation and amortization  certain non cash gains and charges  certain other special gains and charges determined by our senior management to be non recurring gains and charges and certain items deemed by our senior management to have little or no bearing on the day to day operating performance of our business segments and reporting units 
the adjustments made to operating income directly correlate with the adjustments to net income in calculating adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis pursuant to the senior secured credit agreement  which reflects management s interpretations thereof  including treatment of discontinued operations 
limitations adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for us gaap measures of earnings and cash flows 
material limitations associated with making the adjustments to our earnings and cash flows to calculate adjusted ebitda  and using this non gaap financial measure as compared to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measures  include the cash portion of interest expense  net  income tax provision benefit  and restructuring as well as non recurring charges related to securities issuance  acquisition activities  and systems organization establishment  generally represent charges gains which may significantly affect funds available to use in our operating  investing and financing activities  non operating foreign exchange gains losses  although not immediately affecting cash used in investing activities  may affect the amount of funds needed to service our debt if those currency impacts remain in place as we meet our future principal repayment obligations  depreciation  amortization  non cash gains charges and impairment charges  though not directly affecting our current cash position  represent the wear and tear and or reduction in value of the plant  equipment and intangible assets which permit us to manufacture and or market our products  these items may be indicative of future needs for capital expenditures  for development or acquisition of intangible assets or relevant trends causing asset value changes  and the results of our groupe novasep segment that was sold in january have been reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
an investor or potential investor may find any one or all of these items important in evaluating our performance  results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
management compensates for the limitations of using non gaap financial measures by using them only to supplement our us gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
adjusted ebitda is not an alternative to net income loss or income loss before taxes or operating income or cash flows from operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap 
you should not rely on adjusted ebitda as a substitute for any such us gaap financial measures 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliations of adjusted ebitda to gaap financial measures and other financial information  in each case included elsewhere in this annual report 
we also strongly urge you not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to those of other companies 
results of operations actual results of operations the following table presents the major components of our operations on an actual basis and adjusted ebitda the reconciliation to net income is set forth in reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda for the years ended december   and  including as a percentage of net sales  for the periods presented

actual year ended december  compared to actual year ended december  net sales increased million for the year ended december  compared with the same period in as a result of sales increases in all segments 
in particular  our specialty chemicals segment had higher sales on increased volumes and selling prices to offset higher raw material costs 
in addition  our electronics segment posted solid results on increased sales volumes to the printed circuit board and semiconductor markets 
net sales in our performance additives segment benefited from the impact of the acquisition of the s d chemie businesses at the end of and higher selling prices to offset higher raw material and energy costs 
lastly  net sales in our advanced ceramics segment were up primarily from increased volumes of mechanical systems and mechanical and electronic applications 
see further discussion by segment below 
we also had increased operating income and adjusted ebitda in primarily due to the sales increases noted above 
operating income and adjusted ebitda results were negatively impacted by higher raw material and energy costs in all businesses  particularly from the impact of record high copper costs in in our timber treatment chemicals business in our performance additives segment  higher zinc  phosphoric acid and lithium solvent costs in our specialty chemicals segment  higher aom  pvc resin and plasticizer costs in our specialty compounds segment and higher zinc and slag costs in our titanium dioxide segment 
net income from continuing operations decreased million for the year ended december  compared with the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in foreign currency gains reflecting the non cash currency impact on our euro denominated debt and higher raw material and energy costs 
in october  we designated the majority of our euro denominated debt as a net investment hedge 
as a result  since october   foreign exchange gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity for as long as the hedge remains effective 
this was partially offset by increased net sales  the loss on early extinguishment of debt of million recorded in and the management services agreement termination fee of million recorded in income from discontinued operations  net of tax and minority interest  increased million for the year ended december  compared with the same period in the prior year primarily due to losses incurred in related to capacity utilization issues at the rohner plant and an impairment charge of million recorded in related to the downsizing of the rohner manufacturing facility 
this was partially offset by the pre tax loss of million recorded in in connection with the sale of rohner 
see note  discontinued operations  for further details 
net income increased million for the year ended december  compared with the same period in the prior year primarily due to the reasons noted above 
net sales specialty chemicals 
net sales for our specialty chemicals segment increased million over the prior year  primarily on higher volumes in the surface treatment business  and higher selling prices of million in the fine chemicals businesses and million in the surface treatment business 
net sales in the surface treatment business were favorably impacted by growth in all markets and regions  particularly in general industrial and coil applications 
in the fine chemicals business  strong demand for lithium applications  particularly sales of butyllithium to the pharmaceutical industry  lithium specialty compounds and lithium battery products  continued to have a favorable impact on sales 
unfavorable weather conditions at our lithium ponds in chile in early had a negative impact on sales volumes 
performance additives 
net sales for our performance additives segment increased million over the prior year primarily due to higher selling prices million and volumes 
higher selling prices were reported in all businesses  particularly the color pigments and services and clay based additives businesses to offset higher raw material and energy costs 
volumes were up primarily in the clay based additives  water treatment chemicals and color pigments and services businesses 
in the clay based additives business  volumes were up on increased sales to the carbonless paper and rheological additives markets primarily from the acquisition of the s d chemie businesses on december  and increased coatings and inks and oilfield sales 
in the water treatment chemicals business  volumes were higher on increased sales of pool and spa chemical products and surface water products 
higher construction volumes in north america in our color pigments and services business also had a favorable impact on net sales 
lower volumes of acq products in our timber treatment chemicals business had a negative impact on sales year over year 
titanium dioxide pigments 
net sales for our titanium dioxide pigments segment increased million over the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to higher selling prices of our titanium dioxide products in anatase and rutile grade  as well as volume and selling price increases in our functional additives products 
in addition  currency changes of million had a positive impact on net sales 
advanced ceramics 
net sales for our advanced ceramics segment increased million over the prior year 
the increase was due to increased sales in most businesses  particularly from increased volumes of mechanical systems and mechanical  electronic and cutting tool applications and the positive impact of currency changes million 
this increase was partially offset by lower volumes of medical products and selling price declines of million primarily in piezo and electronic applications 
specialty compounds 
net sales for our specialty compounds segment increased million over the prior year primarily due to the impact of higher selling prices of million to offset higher raw material costs  a favorable product mix and the impact of positive currency changes million  partially offset by lower sales volumes 
lower volumes of wire and cable  automotive and footwear products had a negative impact on net sales 
electronics 
net sales for our electronics segment increased million over the prior year primarily due to higher volumes in our electronic chemicals and photomasks businesses in all regions on sales to the printed circuit board and semiconductor markets 
this increase was partially offset by lower volumes in the wafer reclaim business primarily due to the closure of our uk facility in january and the closure of one of our us facilities in march gross profit gross profit increased million over the prior year primarily due to the sales increases noted above 
this was partially offset by raw material cost increases  particularly from the impact of record high copper costs in our timber treatment chemicals business in the performance additives segment  higher zinc and slag costs in the titanium dioxide segment  pvc resin and aom cost increases in the specialty compounds segment and higher zinc  phosphoric acid and lithium solvent costs in the specialty chemicals segment  and higher energy costs 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in the year ended december  versus in the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  increased million primarily due to higher sg a costs in a number of our segments related to increased sales volumes 
in addition  higher corporate costs to meet the requirements of being a public company including external and internal audit costs of section of sarbanes oxley  fees relating to the implementation of a new consolidation software system  as well as higher incentive compensation resulted in higher sg a costs 
sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales were in the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  impairment charges we recorded an impairment charge of million in related to the writedown of machinery and equipment in the fine chemicals division of the specialty chemicals segment 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million for a plant closure in our color pigments and services business within our performance additives segment 
see note  impairment charges  for further details

adjusted ebitda loss at corporate increased million as higher central costs to operate the significantly larger business due to the dynamit nobel acquisition were partially offset by savings from headcount reductions at the former dynamit nobel corporate headquarters 
reconciliation of pro forma income loss before taxes to pro forma adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  because we view adjusted ebitda on both a consolidated and segment basis as an operating performance measure  we use net income loss as the most comparable us gaap measure on a consolidated basis and income loss before taxes and minority interest as the most comparable us gaap measure on a segment basis

net cash provided by operating activities increased in primarily from lower cash interest expense and higher operating income  partially offset by higher operating working capital 
net cash provided by operating activities increased in over primarily from higher operating income  partially offset by an increase in working capital primarily due to higher sales levels in and certain one time payments in investing activities

net cash used for investing activities for the year ended december  and was primarily comprised of capital expenditures and acquisitions 
net cash used for acquisitions in was related to businesses acquired in our advanced ceramics and specialty compounds segments 
in  we acquired the s d chemie businesses that are part of the clay based additives business in our performance additives segment 
net cash used for investing activities in was primarily related to the dynamit nobel acquisition and also included net cash used for the acquisition of the pigments and dispersions business of johnson matthey plc 
and the groupe novasep combination 
net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations was comprised primarily of capital expenditures for and financing activities

net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations was comprised primarily of payments of long term debt for all years presented 
liquidity our primary source of liquidity has been and will continue to be cash generated from the operations of our subsidiaries 
in addition  the following events are also sources of liquidity on january   our wholly owned subsidiary and rohm and haas company formed viance  llc  a joint venture company 
we received cash proceeds of million and used approximately million to pay fees and expenses associated with this transaction 
the remainder was used for general corporate purposes 
on january   we sold our groupe novasep subsidiary and received net cash proceeds of million 
we expect to use a portion of the proceeds to repay indebtedness  which should cause interest expense to be lower than it was prior to the sale 
we expect the interest savings associated with the reduction of debt to largely offset the historic cash flow from this subsidiary 
under the terms of the company s senior secured credit facility  the company is generally not permitted to repay any subordinated debt unless it repays an equal amount of term loans 
the company is currently seeking an amendment of its senior secured credit facility  among other things  to permit the redemption in may of its outstanding notes without a concurrent term loan repayment 
on february   we completed the sale of our united states wafter reclaim business for approximately million 
we expect to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes 
see note  subsequent events  for further details on the above events 
on august   we completed an ipo of  shares of our common stock  which included  shares issued and sold as a result of the underwriters exercise of the over allotment option 
as a result  we received net proceeds of approximately million net of underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses aggregating million 
the net proceeds were primarily used to repay indebtedness 
see note  long term debt  and note  redeemable convertible preferred stock  for further details 
our primary liquidity requirements are working capital  debt service  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
our debt service requirements and other contractual obligations and commitments over the next several years are significant and are substantially higher than historical amounts 
we believe that our currently available sources of liquidity will be sufficient for these needs 
furthermore  any future major acquisitions  business combinations or similar transactions will likely require additional capital resources 
if our present operating performance and current market conditions continue  we believe that such resources will be available to us for certain transactions 
we would need access to alternative sources of liquidity for larger acquisitions such as through additional borrowings  equity issuances or other sources 
we may not have access to these sources of cash for a variety of reasons 
see item  business  and item a  risk factors 
we believe that based on current and anticipated levels of operations and conditions in our industry and markets  cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be adequate for and the foreseeable future to make required payments of principal and interest on our debt and fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
we are taking actions to reduce overhead and excess or unprofitable manufacturing capacity  in part to improve our long term liquidity 
as noted in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  general  above  we are also applying the same initiatives used after the kkr acquisition reducing net working capital as a percentage of net sales through improved systems and manager incentives as well as implementation of stringent controls to help ensure that maintenance capital expenditures are appropriate and that expansion capital expenditures are in line with both capacity and market demands 
we expect this to further improve our short and long term liquidity 
if our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility are insufficient to fund our currently existing liquidity requirements  we may be forced to use other means available to us  such as reduce or delay capital expenditures and seek additional capital 
we may not have adequate capital for future acquisitions  business combinations or similar transactions 
as of december   we had actual total indebtedness of  million 
as of december   the revolving credit facility under the senior secured credit facilities provided for additional borrowings of up to million  after giving effect to million of letters of credit issued on our behalf and outstanding borrowings of million under the revolving credit facility 
we incurred substantial amounts of debt in connection with the dynamit nobel acquisition 
specifically  we entered into new senior secured credit facilities of approximately  million and a new senior subordinated loan facility of million based on the exchange rate at july  
we also received an equity contribution of million from affiliates of kkr and dljmb 
the proceeds from the acquisition financings were used at the closing of the dynamit nobel acquisition to finance the purchase price of the businesses acquired in the dynamit nobel acquisition  repay all amounts outstanding under our old senior credit facilities which totaled approximately million  repay assumed debt of approximately million  fund approximately million of cash settlement of derivative transactions related to the dynamit nobel acquisition and pay related fees and expenses 
we also assumed certain standby letters of credit and comparable obligations 
in connection with the dynamit nobel acquisition  we also received equity contributions of approximately million from management and certain other employees 
specifically  from september to december  we sold  shares of our common stock to members of our management and certain other employees for gross proceeds of million 
in connection with the sale of these shares  pursuant to the stock plan  we granted stock options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock to these members of our management and certain other employees 
subsequent to the closing of the dynamit nobel acquisition  on september   we drew the remaining million of the term loans in connection with the acquisition of the pigments and dispersions business of johnson matthey plc 
in addition  on october   we amended the senior secured credit facilities to borrow an additional million and million or million in aggregate of term loans and used the additional borrowings to repay a portion of our senior subordinated loan and to pay related fees 
on november   we issued the notes and used the net proceeds to repay the remaining outstanding borrowings under the senior subordinated loan facility of million and million or million in the aggregate  plus accrued interest on the remaining outstanding borrowings and pay related fees and expenses and fund general corporate purposes 
on december   we refinanced all outstanding borrowings under the tranche b term loans with new tranche d term loans in order to reduce interest expense 
senior secured credit facilities 
the senior secured credit facilities  as amended  consist of tranche a term loans in an aggregate principal amount of million or approximately million at december  and tranche a term loans in an aggregate principal amount of million or approximately million at december   each maturing on july  and bearing interest at adjusted euribor plus  tranche e term loans in an aggregate principal amount of  million at december   maturing on july  and bearing interest at the company s option of either i adjusted libor plus or ii abr plus  tranche f term loans in an aggregate principal amount of million or approximately million at december   maturing on july  and bearing interest at adjusted euribor plus  and a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of million maturing on july   bearing interest at the company s option of either i adjusted libor plus or ii abr plus 
as of december   we had borrowings of million outstanding under this facility and had outstanding letters of credit of million that reduced our availability under the credit facility

tranche a and a term loans are payable in january and july of each year at escalating percentages of the original principal amount 
tranche e and tranche f term loans are payable in january and july of each year at amounts equal to of the principal amount of the former tranche c term loans and tranche d term loans  respectively  with the remainder due at the final maturity date 
the company s borrowings and the borrowings of rockwood specialties limited under the senior secured credit facilities are guaranteed and secured by assets and pledges of capital stock 
in addition to the financial covenants described below under covenant compliance  the company s senior secured credit facilities contain various affirmative and restrictive covenants 
the restrictive covenants limit our ability to  among other things  incur indebtedness and other liabilities  create liens  merge or consolidate  dispose of assets  make investments  pay dividends and make payments to shareholders  make payments on certain indebtedness or to amend documents related to certain indebtedness and to enter into sale leaseback transactions 
notes and notes 
the notes had an aggregate principal amount of million  at december   and mature on may  and the notes have an aggregate principal amount of million million in the case of the euro notes and million in the case of the dollar notes  and mature on november  we redeemed million  or  of the notes as part of the ipo 
interest on both the notes and notes is payable semi annually on may and november interest on the notes accrues at the rate of per year  and interest on the notes accrues at the rate of in the case of euro notes and in the case of dollar notes 
certain of our domestic subsidiaries guarantee the notes and notes on a senior subordinated unsecured basis 
the company may redeem the notes in whole or in part  at a premium  which declines annually through maturity 
the notes and notes contain various affirmative and restrictive covenants 
the restrictive covenants limit our ability  and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries  to  among other things  incur or guarantee additional indebtedness as described below under covenant compliance  pay dividends or make other equity distributions or repurchase capital stock  make investments or other restricted payments  create liens  transfer or sell assets  restrict dividends or other payments to us  engage in transactions with affiliates  and merge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of our assets 
covenant compliance 
in addition to the affirmative and restrictive covenants  the senior secured credit agreement contains the following financial covenants that are determined based on our adjusted ebitda  which reflects management s interpretations thereof  including treatment of discontinued operations a maximum total leverage ratio for the twelve month period ended december   net debt to adjusted ebitda must be less than to  for such period  our ratio equaled to  and a minimum interest coverage ratio for the twelve month period ended december   adjusted ebitda to cash interest expense interest expense  net excluding deferred debt issuance cost amortization and the movements in the mark to market value of our interest rate and cross currency interest rate derivatives must be at least to  for such period  our ratio equaled to these covenants are material terms of the senior secured credit agreement 
non compliance with these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit agreement and the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed immediately due and payable 
any such acceleration would also result in a default under the indentures governing the notes and the notes  which could lead to the note holders electing to declare the principal  premium  if any  and interest on the then outstanding notes immediately due and payable 
the indentures governing the notes and notes prohibit us from incurring additional debt  subject to certain permitted incurrences  unless the fixed charge coverage ratio  which is the ratio of adjusted ebitda as defined therein excluding certain adjustments permitted under the senior secured credit agreement to fixed charges as defined therein  for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters is at least to in addition  the indentures prohibit us from making restricted payments such as dividends or other equity distributions  repurchases of capital stock or restricted investments  subject to certain permitted payments  unless  among other things  the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters is at least to for the four fiscal quarter period ended december   the fixed charge coverage ratio equaled 
this covenant is a material term of the indentures governing the notes and notes 
we were in compliance with all of the above covenants as of december  and given our use of adjusted ebitda see special note regarding non gaap financial measures for the definition of adjusted ebitda and management s uses of adjusted ebitda as a liquidity measure  the following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted ebitda year ended december  in millions net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations changes in assets and liabilities  net of the effect of foreign currency translation and acquisitions current portion of income tax provision interest expense  net  excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and unrealized losses gains on derivatives restructuring and related charges a cca litigation defense costs systems organization establishment expenses cancelled acquisition and disposal costs costs incurred related to debt modifications stamp duty tax inventory write up reversal management services agreement termination fee bad debt provision gains related to asset sales other adjusted ebitda from continuing operations discontinued operations total adjusted ebitda a includes inventory writedowns of million and million recorded in cost of products sold for the years ended december  and  respectively 
contractual obligations the following table details rockwood s fixed contractual cash obligations as of december  in millions total less than year years years after years debt  including current portion a operating leases purchase obligations b total c d a amounts represent the expected principal payments of our long term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments or bond premiums or discounts 
this amount also includes estimated scheduled cash interest payments totaling  million 
a portion of the debt balance outstanding as of december  contained a variable interest rate component 
therefore  interest was calculated on this portion based upon the average of the rates in effect as of december  see note  long term debt 
b purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
c statutory minimum funding requirements for for defined benefit pension plans are not included as such amounts have not been determined 
for  the company expects to make contributions of approximately million to pension trusts and million directly to plan participants as benefit payments 
future contributions are not included  as they are not fixed either as to timing or amount 
d obligations relating to eventual settlement of derivative contracts are not included as the timing and amounts are not fixed 
these contracts are marked to market with the related liabilities or assets depending on the mark to market position 
at december   the mark to market position of obligations relating to derivative contracts was an asset and was recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
capital expenditures rockwood s capital expenditures in consisted primarily of replacements of worn  obsolete or damaged equipment as well as investments in new equipment  mostly for our specialty chemicals  advanced ceramics  and titanium dioxide pigments segments 
capital expenditures in our advanced ceramics segment primarily related to expanding our medical products production facility 
in our specialty chemicals segment  we made a significant investment in connection with lithium production 
in addition  capital expenditures in our titanium dioxide pigments segment were primarily at our existing manufacturing facilities 
for the year ended december   capital expenditures  excluding capital leases  were million 
capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately the same as expenditures 
for the years ended december  and  our capital expenditures  excluding capital leases  amounted to million and million  respectively 
we may incur future costs for capital improvements and general compliance under safety  health and environmental she laws 
for the year ended december   our capital expenditures for she matters totaled approximately million  excluding costs to maintain and repair pollution control equipment 
for  we estimate capital expenditures for compliance with she laws to be at similar levels  however  because capital expenditures for these matters are subject to changes in and new she laws  we cannot provide assurance that our recent expenditures will be indicative of future amounts required to comply with these laws 
we are applying our capital discipline and stringent controls to reduce our future capital expenditures 
our annual capital expenditures could increase in amount  but we do not believe they will change significantly from current levels in proportion to the size of the combined entity or as a percentage of net sales 
foreign currency related transactions as of december   based on the friday  december  exchange rate of   million of the debt outstanding is denominated in euros million

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates include assessing  among other things the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations  the use and recoverability of inventory  the valuation of deferred tax assets  impairment of goodwill  property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets  and the useful lives of tangible and intangible assets 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe the following to be the most critical accounting policies and estimates affecting preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete 
product sales are recognized when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the terms of the contract of sale  title and risk of loss have been transferred and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we believe that we have adequate credit granting procedures in place and operating effectively so that collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have a low incidence of uncollectible accounts 
additionally  credit insurance is purchased at times by certain of our businesses  particularly in europe  to protect against collection risk 
accruals are made for sales returns based on our experience and for other allowances based on the terms of allowance programs put in place 
although we believe that sufficient experience and history exists to make reasonable estimates as to such accruals and allowances  actual results can differ depending on market conditions 
impairment accounting 
the recoverability of goodwill is reviewed on an annual basis during the fourth quarter 
additionally  the recoverability of goodwill  long lived tangible  and certain intangible assets is reviewed when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
initial goodwill impairment review begins with the estimate of fair value of each reporting unit generally based on an industry metric such as the ratio of enterprise value commonly defined as market capitalization  plus long term debt  less cash to adjusted ebitda of the reporting unit for the current year and the following year budget 
if potential impairment is identified  we may expand the review to take into account expected future cash flows in subsequent years 
similarly  when we test for impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill we initially review the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset or asset group collectively asset 
if it appears that the asset is impaired based on undiscounted cash flows  the estimated fair value of the asset is calculated on a present value basis by multiplying the estimated future annual cash flows of the asset by the then current enterprise value ratio a discounted measure or by a discount factor appropriate to the related reporting unit  in accordance with paragraph of sfas an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of the asset or goodwill exceeds the discounted cash flow or other measure of fair value 
we did not recognize a goodwill impairment loss for the years ended december  and as a result of the impairment analysis that was performed 
for the year ended december   we did recognize a goodwill impairment loss of million in our electronics segment as a result of the impairment analysis that was completed 
these calculations are based on inherent assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and appropriate benchmark peer companies or groups 
subsequent changes in these assumptions could result in future impairment 
although we consistently use the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations  such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results 
for example  if the peer group multiples used in had been lower  we might have had a potential goodwill impairment of million in one of our reporting units 
if the peer group multiples used in had been lower  we might have had a potential goodwill impairment of million in one of our reporting units 
if the peer group multiples used in had been lower  no additional potential goodwill impairment would have been identified 
as noted above  if we had discovered such a potential impairment we might have expanded the review to prepare more detailed estimates of future cash flows in subsequent years  which might have resulted in a different impairment assessment 
during the fourth quarter of  management performed an impairment review of a business within the fine chemicals division of the specialty chemicals segment due to poor profitability 
based on this review  an impairment charge of million was recorded to write down the full value of machinery and equipment 
in  we reviewed for impairment the assets of our rohner ag facility within our former groupe novasep reporting unit see note  discontinued operations  for further details 
based on this review  it was determined that an impairment charge of million to the remaining amount of property  plant and equipment of the rohner facility should be recorded 
as discussed  our groupe novasep subsidiary was sold in january and the results of this subsidiary are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during  we did not have any other circumstances that caused us to review the values of any other individual long lived assets for impairment 
in  we also reviewed for impairment the assets of an entire reporting unit within our electronics segment as goodwill impairment charges were recorded 
had the future cash flow estimates in been lower  we would have recorded an additional impairment in this reporting unit of approximately million in business combinations 
we account for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting as required by sfas  business combinations 
under the purchase method of accounting  we are required to allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
examples of material estimates from our previous acquisitions are the fair values of work in process and finished goods inventories are estimated based on selling price less selling profit 
the calculation of selling profit requires a judgment on the relative margins derived from manufacturing vs 
marketing efforts 
the fair value of property  plant and equipment can be estimated by a variety of methods taking into account market values  replacement cost  and remaining useful life 
although market value and replacement cost is sometimes readily obtainable  often this requires judgment  as does determining the estimated remaining useful life 
when we believe that property  plant and equipment acquired will be material to our overall balance sheet  or that fair value might represent a significant difference from the historical cost net of accumulated depreciation of such assets  we have engaged an independent appraiser to provide us with expert advice on such estimates  as we have done in our recent acquisitions 
however  it is not uncommon for appraisers to differ on the valuation of items such as manufacturing equipment where a ready secondary market does not exist 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as patents and other intellectual property  customer lists  and trademarks  can be estimated by discounted cash flow and return on royalties 
the process utilized to identify intangible assets is consistent with the requirements of sfas when considered material  we have engaged an independent appraiser to provide expert advice in the identification of intangible assets acquired  valuation of such assets and determination of the estimated useful life 
an independent appraiser  with management s oversight and input  is required to make judgments and estimates that could cause such appraisals to differ from those of other appraisal experts 
in order to determine the fair value of intangible assets and other long term assets  a discount rate and royalty rate is determined in conjunction with our independent appraiser 
the royalty rate is based on professional judgment taking into consideration the type of product  market and perceived strength 
the discount rate and royalty rate has a material impact on the determination of the fair value 
purchase accounting often involves the same critical estimates that are required in our ordinary course of business including estimates deferred tax assets or liabilities  pension liabilities  restructuring liabilities and legal and environmental reserves 
goodwill is an intangible asset that represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
while goodwill itself does not represent an estimate  under sfas we must assign goodwill to one or more reporting units 
allocation of goodwill to reporting units requires judgments about the relative fair values of reporting units including the fair value of their identifiable assets and estimates as to the present value of future cash flows expected from the reporting units as adjusted by weighted average and or risk adjusted costs of capital 
goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually 
some of our business combinations have complex terms that may result in conflicting claims between buyer and seller concerning the purchase price itself 
management is required to assess the probability and amount or range of amounts of such claims  and  where possible  determine the most likely amount due 
legal matters 
we are involved in various legal proceedings  including commercial  product liability  intellectual property and environmental matters  of a nature that can be expected in our business 
it is our policy to accrue for amounts related to these matters in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies  if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
the probability that a contingent liability has been incurred is regularly assessed by our legal staff  based on periodic reviews of available facts and circumstances for our legal matters  with senior operating and finance management both at the business accountable for the potential liability and at our corporate offices 
this is supplemented where applicable by consultation with outside counsel 
we do not believe it is informative to quantify past experience at assessing probability or estimating exposure since material matters of this nature at rockwood often represent unique situations with little applicability to the assessment of probability or estimation of potential liability regarding other legal matters 
it is our policy to disclose such matters when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred 
environmental matters 
we accrue costs of a non capital nature related to environmental clean up when those costs are believed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated 
expenditures that extend the life of the related property or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized  and expenditures related to existing conditions resulting from past or present operations and from which no current or future benefit is discernible are immediately expensed 
the quantification of environmental exposures requires an assessment of many factors  including changing laws and regulations  advancements in environmental technologies  the quality of information available related to specific sites  the assessment stage of each site investigation and the length of time involved in remediation or settlement 
as such  it can be extremely difficult to accurately estimate such costs 
we do not include anticipated recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties in our accruals for environmental liabilities 
we have estimated and established financial reserves relating to anticipated environmental cleanup obligations  site reclamation and remediation and closure costs 
on a consolidated basis  we have accrued approximately million for known environmental liabilities as of december  given that these obligations may be paid relieved over extended time periods years in some cases  charges or credits to operations may be required as information is gathered and estimates refined 
we have evaluated our total environmental exposure based on currently available data and believe that such environmental matters will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 
if matters previously identified by management are resolved in a manner different from original estimates  there is the potential for a material adverse effect on operating results or cash flows in any one accounting period 
see note  commitments and contingencies 
restructuring 
we record restructuring charges from time to time that represent expenses incurred in connection with consolidations and cessations of certain of our operations as well as headcount reduction programs 
these charges consist primarily of write offs of surplus assets and severance costs 
these charges are based on various factors including the employee s length of service  contract provisions  salary levels and local governmental legislation 
at the time a related charge is recorded  we calculate our best estimate based upon detailed analysis 
although significant changes are not expected  actual costs may differ from these estimates 
for example  we have accrued liabilities of million as of december  to cover restructuring liabilities for employee severance  facility closure and relocation costs 
the portion of this accrued liability that was recorded as part of purchase accounting is not charged to operations  but was recorded as part of goodwill 
in the event that our estimates of such costs are too low  an additional charge to operations would be required 
deferred taxes 
we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on available evidence weighted toward evidence that is objectively verifiable 
while we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income or decrease goodwill for any net deferred tax assets acquired in the dynamit nobel acquisition in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our recorded net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
we have cumulative net operating loss carry forwards in the us  germany and italy for which we have reserved 
the valuation allowance also includes certain states in the us as we have concluded realizability of these net operating loss carry forwards is not more likely than not 
we have not recorded valuation allowances on a significant portion of our german net operating loss carry forwards as we have considered positive evidence such as forecasted future taxable income based on historical taxable income adjusted for charges which are not indicative of future operations and as the carry forward period is indefinite 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  sfas paragraph  requires consideration of future taxable income and other available evidence when assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
various assumptions and strategies including elections for tax purposes are implicit in estimates of forecasted future taxable income 
we believe that  in situations in which future realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on taxable income from future operations  sfas requires the relative significance of cumulative losses be addressed within the guidance provided in paragraphs and accordingly  in assessing the realization of us jurisdiction net operating loss carry forwards for the years ended december   and  and  considering future taxable income  we have identified the key elements of both positive and negative evidence and evaluated such evidence by applying the guidance provided by paragraphs and of sfas the worldwide valuation allowance increased by million to million at december   primarily due to the increase in us deferred tax assets 
of this amount  million has been recorded to other comprehensive income  million as an increase to income tax expense and million as an increase to goodwill 
the remainder relates to foreign currency translation adjustments 
as of december   we had three years of net cumulative losses in the uk as such  we evaluated the net deferred tax assets of approximately million related to our uk entities 
our policy to determine future income available to realize the deferred tax assets is based on determining the normalized annual taxable income 
based on our steady state analysis prepared in accordance with our policy  we had sufficient income available to utilize the deferred tax assets 
the steady state analysis prepared includes material management assumptions that relate to the appropriateness of including non recurring permanent cost reductions as well as the impact from recent acquisitions in the uk furthermore  we have identified a tax planning strategy which would reduce the amount of future losses as part of our evaluation of evidence regarding the need for a valuation allowance 
based on our steady state analysis and available tax planning strategy  we have concluded that no valuation allowance is needed as of december  we are committed to buying and selling businesses within our portfolio of businesses as opportunities arise to enhance our overall results 
we are committed to selling assets which are non core and which would generate a taxable gain in the event of expiring us federal nol s 
to the extent that the provision for income taxes increases decreases by of income before taxes  consolidated net income would have declined improved by million in stock based compensation 
the sales of common stock and grants of stock options during the year ended december  were made to management and certain other employees in connection with the dynamit nobel acquisition 
accordingly  our board of directors determined that sales and grants would be made at the same purchase price and related exercise price per share paid by kkr and dljmb 
we and kkr had negotiated this price with dljmb on an arm s length basis based on our financial condition  historical results of operations and forecasts of the combined entity resulting from the dynamit nobel acquisition 
determination of fair value at the time the shares of common stock were sold and the stock options were granted  our board of directors determined that the price per share paid by dljmb as part of the dynamit nobel acquisition provided objective in evidence of the fair value of the common stock sold and options granted in the management equity program  and thus did not obtain a contemporaneous valuation by an unrelated valuation specialist 
our board of directors further determined the fair value of the common stock sold and options granted did not change from july  the date of consummation of the dynamit nobel acquisition to november  the date the management equity program was substantially completed because  among other reasons our operations and forecasts had not changed in any material respect  largely due to the proximity in time to the consummation of the dynamit nobel acquisition  uncertainty and risk surrounded the integration of the acquired dynamit nobel businesses with our historical businesses  and at the time of the sales of common stock and the grants of stock options  we had not yet completed the groupe novasep combination  which was subject to numerous closing conditions 
subsequently  we performed a valuation of our common stock as of november  using a retrospective approach consistent with the valuation techniques applied in connection with the july equity investment by kkr and dljmb 
the results of this valuation approach were materially consistent with our board of director s conclusion that the fair value of the common stock on the date of sale or grant was the same as the price per share paid by dljmb 
additionally  we performed an implied market value analysis based on the stock price performance of our eight most comparable peers 
in calculating this implied market value  we applied the percentage change in market value of these peers on a monthly basis beginning with july  the analysis further validated the conclusion that the fair value of the common stock on the date of sale or grant at per share was reasonable 
based on an initial public offering price of per share  the intrinsic value of the options outstanding at december  was million  of which million related to vested options and million related to unvested options 
significant factors  assumptions  and methodologies used in determining fair value in determining the fair value of our common stock prior to becoming a public company  we needed to make complex and subjective judgments 
this determination represented a critical accounting estimate 
specifically  we retrospectively determined fair value as of november  by multiplying the adjusted ebitda of the combined company on a pro forma last twelve months basis by the same multiple at which kkr and dljmb valued the combined rockwood and dynamit nobel businesses in july the enterprise value of the combined company was then determined by subtracting from this amount the combined company s long term debt  net of cash and cash equivalents  as of november  this resulting enterprise value was then divided by the outstanding number of shares as of november  to determine the estimated fair value per share 
significant factors contributing to the difference between fair value as of the dates of each grant and ipo price during the year ended december   we granted  stock options  each with an exercise price of per share  which we also determined to be the fair value of our common stock 
we believe the difference between per share and the public offering price is due to several factors that were not anticipated on the dates of the common stock sales and stock option grants and certain events that have occurred  and have resulted  in an increased fair value of our common stock in connection with the initial public offering 
they include market factors successful initial public offerings by two chemical companies two chemical companies successfully completed an initial public offering in november and january this return of chemical companies to the public equity markets in an initial public offering context bolstered our equity value by significantly increasing our chances of successfully completing an initial public offering 
based on the successful initial public offering in the united states of one of these companies  previously listed in germany  the likelihood of a successful us initial public offering of a chemicals company with significant european operations  such as rockwood  increased significantly 
completion of the initial public offering the completion of the initial public offering in august increased the value of our common stock due to the resulting significant increase in liquidity and marketability 
in addition  due to the repayment of our pay in kind loans and redemption of our pay in kind notes and senior discount notes  which had a high rate of interest and due to the significant reduction in the cost of equity as a public company  we believe our weighted average cost of capital has declined contributing to a higher valuation of our common stock 
business factors reduced leverage the application of a substantial portion of the net proceeds of the initial public offering to reduce our substantial leverage has improved our liquidity significantly 
this positively affects the net equity value  increasing the overall fair value of the common stock 
successful integration of dynamit nobel 
the integration risk associated with the dynamit nobel acquisition has been largely eliminated since the time of the sales of common stock and grants of stock options 
completion of the groupe novasep combination 
on december   we completed the groupe novasep combination 
we believe this combination improved the value of this former segment and our overall value 
during and  we granted stock options for  shares and  shares  respectively  of common stock 
these options had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  which we adopted on january   we are required to recognize the cost resulting from all share based payment awards in our statement of operations beginning in the first quarter of the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company in see note  stock based compensation  for further details 
pensions  postemployment and postretirement costs 
in connection with the kkr  dynamit nobel  and pigments and dispersion acquisitions as well as the groupe novasep combination  rockwood assumed responsibility for the pension and postretirement benefits for substantially all of the employees of the businesses acquired that were active as of the date of the acquisition 
for the kkr and pigments and dispersion acquisitions  obligations related to retired and terminated vested employees as of such date remained the responsibility of the seller  and accordingly  these obligations are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
defined benefit costs and liabilities have been determined in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for pensions and sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
postretirement benefit costs and liabilities have been determined in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
postemployment benefit costs and liabilities have been determined in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
the measurement of our pension obligations  costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants  with consideration to the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases due to marketplace conditions and or inflation and demographic experience such as retirement and mortality rates 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions or benefit payments 
for funded plans  the plan trustee obtains an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets and prepares estimates of expected returns based on target asset allocations multiplied by current marketplace rates of return for comparable assets 
we base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on aa rated corporate long term bonds 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore are likely to affect our recognized expense in those periods 
we cannot predict these bond yields or investment returns and therefore cannot reasonably estimate whether adjustments to our stockholders equity for minimum pension liability in subsequent years will be significant 
estimated sensitivity of our pension funded status and stockholders equity and annual pension expense to a increase decrease in the discount rate assumption is shown below as of and for the year ended december  the estimates were based on inquiries of the actuaries of plans representing approximately of total pension funded status as of december  remaining plans are assumed to have similar sensitivities 
the december  funded status and stockholders equity are affected by assumptions as of december  while annual pension expense is affected by december  assumptions as of december  in millions us plans non us plans pension impact of a change in discount rate a funded status funded status equity expense basis points basis points a based on sensitivities provided by actuaries for the main german and uk schemes 
other countries plans are assumed to have similar sensitivities 
as shown above  changes in the discount rate can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans and stockholders equity 
as noted above  the funded status and stockholders equity of our funded plans might also be significantly affected by assumptions concerning expected return of plan assets 
however  given that most of our pension obligations do not require funding  such sensitivity would be significantly less 
useful lives of plant and equipment 
we determine the estimated useful lives and related depreciation charges for our plant and equipment 
depreciation is determined using the straight line method over the various asset classes 
estimated lives range from years for buildings and improvements including land improvements  years for machinery and equipment  years for furniture and fixtures and years for mining rights 
to the extent actual lives are less than previously estimated lives  we will increase our depreciation charge or will write off or write down obsolete assets 
to the extent that our plant and equipment actual useful lives differ from management s estimates by percent  consolidated net income would be an estimated million higher lower based upon results  depending upon whether the actual lives were longer shorter  respectively  than the estimates 
useful lives of other intangible assets 
we determine the estimated useful lives and related amortization charges for our other intangible assets 
other intangible assets primarily consist of patents and other intellectual property  trade names and trademarks  and customer relationships 
patents and other intellectual property are recorded at their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition and are being amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives  ranging from to years 
trade names and trademarks are being amortized over years  and customer relationships are amortized from to years 
to the extent actual lives are less than previously estimated lives  we will increase our amortization charge or will write off or write down obsolete other intangible assets 
to the extent that the actual useful lives of our other intangible assets differ from management s estimates by percent  consolidated net income would be an estimated million higher lower based upon results  depending upon whether the actual lives were longer shorter  respectively  than the estimates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives 
when used  derivatives are employed as risk management tools and not for trading purposes 
interest rate risk we had million and million of variable rate debt after hedging outstanding as of december  and  respectively  at the then applicable exchange rate 
any borrowings under our revolving credit facility will also be at a variable rate 
although we are not required under the terms of any of our long term debt facilities to hedge  or otherwise protect against interest rate fluctuation in our variable rate debt  we have entered into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates related to euro denominated debt 
at december   these contracts cover notional amounts of million at rates of and and million at rates ranging from to 
as of december   these contracts covered notional amounts of million at rates of and and million at rates ranging from to 
these derivative contracts effectively convert the senior secured credit facilities to fixed rate obligations 
the maturity dates of the hedges are between july and august we may in the future consider adjusting the amounts covered by these derivative contracts to better suit our capital structure 
each increase or decrease in the assumed weighted average interest rate would change the annual interest expense by million and million in and  respectively 
foreign currency risk we conduct operations in many countries around the world 
our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction risk and currency translation risk 
we operate a geographically diverse business  with of our net sales in generated from customers in europe  in north america predominately in the united states and from the rest of the world based upon customer ship to locations 
for a geographic description of the origin of our net sales and location of our long lived assets  see note  segment information 
our diverse and extensive customer base is served by manufacturing facilities in countries 
although we sell and manufacture our products in many countries  our sales and production costs are mainly denominated in us dollars and euros 
our results of operations and financial condition are therefore impacted by the fluctuation of the euro against our reporting currency  the us dollar 
as a result of the dynamit nobel acquisition  a significantly larger portion of our sales and production costs is now denominated in euros 
approximately of our net sales were derived from subsidiaries whose local currency is the euro 
this increases the impact of the fluctuation of the euro against the us dollar 
we incur currency transaction risk whenever we enter into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity 
gains and losses on currency transactions are included in operating income and do impact our operating margins 
with respect to currency translation risk  our financial condition and results of operations are measured and recorded in the relevant domestic currency and then translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
gains and losses on currency translations are recorded in our consolidated financial statements as a component of other comprehensive income loss and do not impact our operating margins 
exchange rates between these currencies and us dollars in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future 
our financial results are subject to the effect of currency fluctuations on the translation of our euro denominated debt 
as of december  and  our total euro denominated debt equaled million  million based on the friday  december  exchange rate of and million  million based on the december  exchange rate of  respectively 
a weakening or strengthening of the euro against the us dollar by would decrease or increase  respectively  by million and million in and  respectively  the us dollar equivalent of our total euro denominated debt 
gains and losses on the translation of debt denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the borrower are included as a separate component of other income expenses in our statement of operations and accumulated other comprehensive income in our balance sheet 
in connection with the offering of the notes  we entered into cross currency interest rate swaps with a five year term and a notional amount of million that effectively convert the us dollar fixed rate debt in respect of the dollar denominated notes sold into euro fixed rate debt 
we designated this contract as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of our net investment in our euro denominated operations 
in addition  we designated the remaining portion of our euro denominated debt that is recorded on our us books as a net investment hedge of our euro denominated investments as of october  euro debt of million at december   million based on the friday  december  exchange rate of 
as a result  any foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the euro denominated debt discussed above is accounted for as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk for certain of our raw materials  such as copper and zinc 
we have not materially hedged this commodity price exposure to date
