according to am best  as of december   the allstate financial segment is the nation s th largest issuer of life insurance and related business on the basis of ordinary life insurance in force and th largest on the basis of statutory admitted assets 
in addition  because many of these products include a savings or investment component  our competition includes domestic and foreign securities firms  investment advisors  mutual funds  banks and other financial institutions 
competitive pressure continues to grow due to several factors  including cross marketing alliances between unaffiliated businesses  as well as consolidation activity in the financial services industry

reserve for property liability claims and claims expense the following information regarding reserves applies to all of our property liability operations  encompassing both the allstate protection segment and the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
reconciliation of claims reserves the following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves  displayed individually for each of the last three years 
the first table presents reserves on a gross before reinsurance basis 
the end of year gross reserve balances are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial position 
the second table presents reserves on a net after reinsurance basis 
the total net property liability insurance claims and claims expense amounts are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations

the year end gross reserves of billion for property liability insurance claims and claims expense  as determined under gaap  were billion more than the net reserve balance of billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities 
the principal differences are reinsurance recoverables from third parties totaling billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting and are recorded as assets for gaap reporting  and a liability for the reserves of the canadian subsidiaries for million 
remaining differences are due to variations in requirements between gaap and statutory reporting 
as the tables above illustrate  allstate s net reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of decreased in by million  compared to reestimates of the gross reserves of a decrease of million 
net reserve reestimates in  and were more favorable than the gross reserve reestimates due to reinsurance cessions 
loss reserve reestimates the following loss reserve reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years 
the first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year 
the second section  reading down  shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability 
the third section  reading down  shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of allstate s expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims 
the last section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established  and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims 
the table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period  with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable 
the loss reserve reestimates table is cumulative and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years

the decreases in net reserves established as of december  to december  reflects favorable reestimates as more fully discussed below 
the following table is derived from the loss reserve reestimates table and summarizes the effect of reserve reestimates  net of reinsurance  on calendar year operations for the ten year period ended december  the total of each column details the amount of reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the reestimates are applicable 
the amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve reestimates for the indicated accident year s 
favorable reserve reestimates are shown in this table in parenthesis 
effect of net reserve reestimates on calendar year operations in millions total by accident year prior total in  and  we decreased our reserve estimates for prior years 
favorable reserve estimates were primarily due to allstate protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was less than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and in  also by catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates 
decreased reserve reestimates for allstate protection more than offset increased estimates of losses primarily related to asbestos liabilities in the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
in and  we increased our reserve estimates for prior years 
unfavorable reserve reestimates in were due to increases primarily related to asbestos and other discontinued lines  partially offset by favorable allstate protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than previous estimates 
unfavorable reserve reestimates in were due to claim severity and late reported losses for allstate protection that were greater than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and to increased estimates of losses primarily related to asbestos and environmental liabilities in the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
in  we increased our reserve estimates for prior years due to greater volume of late reported weather related losses than expected from the end of the year which were reported in the year  additional incurred losses on the northridge earthquake  adverse results of class action and other litigation  upward reestimates of property losses and upward reestimates of losses in the encompass and canadian businesses 
favorable calendar year reserve reestimates in through were the result of favorable severity trends in each of the four years for allstate protection  which more than offset adverse reestimates in the discontinued lines and coverages segment  primarily for asbestos and environmental liabilities  virtually all of which relates to and prior years 
the favorable severity trend during this period was primarily the result of favorable injury severity trends  as compared to our anticipated trends 
favorable injury severity trends were largely due to more moderate medical cost inflation and the mitigating effects of our loss management programs

regulation allstate is subject to extensive regulation  primarily at the state level 
the method  extent and substance of such regulation varies by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state regulatory agency 
in general  such regulation is intended for the protection of those who purchase or use insurance products issued by our subsidiaries  not the holders of securities issued by the allstate corporation 
these rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters including insurance company licensing and examination  agent and adjuster licensing  price setting  trade practices  policy forms  accounting methods  the nature and amount of investments  claims practices  participation in shared markets and guaranty funds  reserve adequacy  insurer solvency  transactions with affiliates  the payment of dividends  and underwriting standards 
some of these matters are discussed in more detail below 
for a discussion of statutory financial information  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of regulatory contingencies  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
notes and are incorporated in this part i  item by reference 
in recent years the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny 
legislation that would provide for federal chartering of insurance companies has been proposed 
in addition  state legislators and insurance regulators continue to examine the appropriate nature and scope of state insurance regulation 
we cannot predict whether any specific state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of the insurance business or what effect any such measures would have on allstate 
agent and broker compensation 
in  several states considered new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of agents and brokers by insurance companies 
the proposals ranged in nature from new disclosure requirements to new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers 
new disclosure requirements have been imposed in certain circumstances upon some agents and brokers in several states  including texas 
limitations on dividends by insurance subsidiaries 
as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own  the allstate corporation relies on dividends from allstate insurance company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations  including the payment of principal and interest on debt 
allstate insurance company is regulated as an insurance company in illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by illinois law 
for additional information regarding those restrictions  see part ii  item of this report 
the laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive 
holding company regulation 
the allstate corporation and allstate insurance company are insurance holding companies subject to regulation throughout the jurisdictions in which their insurance subsidiaries do business 
in the us  these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of florida  illinois  massachusetts  nebraska  new hampshire  new york  pennsylvania and texas 
generally  the insurance codes in these states provide that the acquisition or change of control of a domestic insurer or of any person that controls a domestic insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulator 
in general  a presumption of control arises from the ownership  control  possession with the power to vote  or possession of proxies with respect to  ten percent or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurer or of a person that controls a domestic insurer 
in addition  certain state insurance laws require pre acquisition notification to state agencies of a change in control with respect to a non domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state 
while such pre acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control  such statutes do authorize certain remedies  including the issuance of a cease and desist order with respect to the non domestic insurer if certain conditions exist  such as undue market concentration 
thus  any transaction involving the acquisition of ten percent or more of the allstate corporation s common stock would generally require prior approval by the state insurance departments in illinois  massachusetts  nebraska  new hampshire  new york  pennsylvania and texas 
the prior approval of the florida insurance department would be necessary for the acquisition of five percent or more 
moreover  notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre acquisition notification provisions and where the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business 
such approval requirements may deter  delay or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of the allstate corporation s common stock 
price regulation 
nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file price schedules  policy or coverage forms  and other information with the state s regulatory authority 
in many cases  such price schedules  policy forms or both must be approved prior to use 
while they vary from state to state  the objectives of the pricing laws are generally the same a price cannot be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
the speed with which an insurer can change prices in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends  in part  on whether the pricing laws are i prior approval  ii file and use  or iii use and file laws 
in states having prior approval laws  the regulator must approve a price before the insurer may use it 
in states having file and use laws  the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator s approval to use a price  but the price must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used 
a use and file law requires an insurer to file prices within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them 
approximately one half of the states  including california and new york  have prior approval laws 
under all three types of pricing laws  the regulator has the authority to disapprove a price subsequent to its filing 
an insurer s ability to adjust its prices in response to competition or to increasing costs is often dependent on an insurer s ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its pricing or proposed pricing meets the requirements of the pricing laws 
in those states that significantly restrict an insurer s discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite  an insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance 
in those states that significantly restrict an insurer s ability to charge a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance  the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites 
when a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing  it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability 
changes in allstate s claim settlement process may require allstate to actuarially adjust loss information used in its pricing process 
some state insurance regulatory authorities may not approve price increases that give full effect to these adjustments 
from time to time  the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators  legislators and special interest groups to reduce  freeze or set prices at levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses 
homeowners insurance comes under similar pressure  particularly as regulators in states subject to high levels of catastrophe losses struggle to identify an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure 
we expect this kind of pressure to persist 
in addition  our use of insurance scoring based on credit report information for underwriting and pricing regularly comes under attack by regulators  legislators and special interest groups in various states 
the result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the profitability of the allstate protection segment 
we cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding pricing 
involuntary markets 
as a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states  we are required to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers 
underwriting results related to these arrangements  which tend to be adverse  have been immaterial to our results of operations 
guaranty funds 
under state insurance guaranty fund laws  insurers doing business in a state can be assessed  up to prescribed limits  in order to cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies 
national flood insurance program 
we voluntarily participate as a write your own wyo carrier in the national flood insurance program nfip 
the nfip is administered and regulated by the federal emergency management agency fema 
we operate as a fiscal agent of the federal government in the selling and administering of the standard flood insurance policy sfip 
this involves the collection of premiums belonging to the federal government and the paying of covered claims by directly drawing on funds of the united states treasury 
we receive expense allowances from nfip for underwriting administration  claims management  commission and adjuster fees 
investment regulation 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit the amount of investment in certain categories 
failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non conforming investments as non admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus 
further  in some instances  these rules require divestiture of non conforming investments 
as of december  the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries complied with such laws and regulations in all material respects 
exiting geographic markets  canceling and non renewing policies 
most states regulate an insurer s ability to exit a market 
for example  states limit  to varying degrees  an insurer s ability to cancel and non renew policies 
some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
regulations that limit cancellation and non renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer s ability to exit unprofitable markets 
variable life insurance  variable annuities and registered fixed annuities 
the sale and administration of variable life insurance  variable annuities and registered fixed annuities with market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level  including regulation and supervision by the securities and exchange commission and the national association of securities dealers 
broker dealers  investment advisors and investment companies 
the allstate entities that operate as broker dealers  registered investment advisors and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the securities and exchange commission  the national association of securities dealers and or  in some cases  state securities administrators 
regulation and legislation affecting consolidation in the financial services industry 
the gramm leach bliley act of permits mergers that combine commercial banks  insurers and securities firms within one holding company group 
in addition  it allows grandfathered unitary thrift holding companies  including our parent company  to engage in activities that are not financial in nature 
the ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may materially adversely affect our business by substantially increasing the number  size and financial strength of potential competitors 
banking 
the allstate corporation is a diversified savings and loan holding company for allstate bank  a federal stock savings bank and a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the principal supervisory authority for the diversified savings and loan holding company activities and the bank is the office of thrift supervision 
the bank is also subject to the authority of the fdic and other federal financial regulators implementing various laws applicable to banking 
privacy regulation 
federal law and the laws of some states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information 
federal law and the laws of some states also regulate disclosures of customer information 
congress  state legislatures and regulatory authorities are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information 
asbestos 
president bush has indicated support for efforts to pass meaningful federal reform to address asbestos claims and litigation 
congress has considered such legislation in the past  but unified support among various defendant and insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking 
in february  there was a renewed effort to bring such measures before the senate 
there has been no real interest by congress in pushing this legislation forward since that time 
we cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos 
environmental 
environmental pollution clean up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state regulation 
the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of superfund and comparable state statutes mini superfund govern the clean up and restoration of waste sites by potentially responsible parties prps 
superfund and the mini superfunds environmental clean up laws or ecls establish a mechanism to assign liability to prps or to fund the clean up of waste sites if prps fail to do so 
the extent of liability to be allocated to a prp is dependent on a variety of factors 
by some estimates  there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean up  but the exact number is unknown 
the extent of clean up necessary and the process of assigning liability remain in dispute 
the insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean up of waste sites by insured prps and the insured parties alleged liability to third parties responsible for the clean up 
the insurance industry  including allstate  has disputed and is disputing many such claims 
key coverage issues include whether superfund response  investigation and clean up costs are considered damages under the policies  trigger of coverage  the applicability of several types of pollution exclusions  proper notice of claims  whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend  appropriate allocation of liability among triggered insurers  and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an occurrence 
identical coverage issues exist for clean up and waste sites not covered under superfund 
to date  courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues 
allstate s exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been  or may be  named as prps is uncertain 
while comprehensive superfund reform proposals have been introduced in congress  only modest reform measures have been enacted

these statements may address  among other things  our strategy for growth  catastrophe exposure management  product development  regulatory approvals  market position  expenses  financial results  litigation and reserves 
we believe that these statements are based on reasonable estimates  assumptions and plans 
however  if the estimates  assumptions or plans underlying the forward looking statements prove inaccurate or if other risks or uncertainties arise  actual results could differ materially from those communicated in these forward looking statements 
in addition to the normal risks of business  we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including those listed below  which apply to us as an insurer and a provider of other financial services 
these risks constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of and readers should carefully review such cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements and historical trends 
these cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this document  in our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec or in materials incorporated therein by reference 
our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations 
risks relating to the property liability business as a property and casualty insurer  we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events  our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man made disasters  including earthquakes  volcanoes  wildfires  tornadoes  hurricanes  tropical storms and certain types of terrorism 
we may continue to incur catastrophe losses in our auto and property business in excess of those experienced in prior years  in excess of those that management projects would be incurred based on hurricane and earthquake losses which have a one percent probability of occurring on an annual aggregate countrywide basis  and in excess of those that modelers estimate would be incurred based on other levels of probability  in excess of the average expected level used in pricing  and in excess of our current reinsurance coverage limits 
while we believe that our natural event catastrophe management initiatives will reduce the potential magnitude of possible future natural event losses  we continue to be exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on operating results and financial position 
for example  our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to hurricane katrina in totaling billion  the northridge earthquake of totaling billion and hurricane andrew in totaling billion 
we are also exposed to assessments from the california earthquake authority  and various state created catastrophe insurance facilities  and to losses that could surpass the capitalization of these facilities 
our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe  or multiple catastrophes  which result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings 
in addition  we are also subject to claims arising from weather events such as winter storms  rain  hail and high winds 
the incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable 
there is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of auto and property claims when severe weather conditions occur 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted and could be material to catastrophe losses although  along with others in the industry  we use models developed by third party vendors in assessing our personal lines property exposure to catastrophe losses that assume various conditions and probability scenarios  such models do not necessarily accurately predict future losses or accurately measure losses currently incurred 
catastrophe models  which have been evolving since the early s  use historical information about hurricanes and earthquakes and also utilize detailed information about our in force business 
while we use this information in connection with our pricing and risk management activities  there are limitations with respect to their usefulness in predicting losses in any reporting period 
these limitations are evident in significant variations in estimates between models and modelers  material increases and decreases in model results due to changes and refinements of the underlying data elements  assumptions which lead to questionable predictive capability  and actual event conditions that have not been well understood previously and not incorporated into the models 
in addition  the models are not necessarily reflective of actual demand surge  loss adjustment expenses and the occurrence of mold losses  which are subject to wide variation by event or location 
impacts of catastrophes and our catastrophe management strategy may adversely affect premium growth we believe that the actions we are taking to support earning an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce the variability in our earnings  while providing quality protection to our customers  will be successful over the long term  however it is possible that they will have a negative impact on near term growth and earnings 
homeowners premium growth rates and retention could be more adversely impacted than we expect by adjustments to our business structure  size and underwriting practices in markets with significant catastrophe risk exposure 
in addition  due to the diminished potential for cross selling opportunities  new business growth in our auto lines could be lower than expected 
efforts to recover the costs of our catastrophe reinsurance program through rate increases may not be entirely successful due to resistance by regulators or non renewal decisions by policyholders resulting in a lower amount of insurance in force 
unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our profitability changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our allstate protection segment 
changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy 
changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs  auto parts prices and used car prices 
changes in homeowner s claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry  in building materials and in home furnishings and by other economic and environmental factors  including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by hurricanes 
however  changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation and demand surge in these various sectors of the economy 
increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict 
examples of such events include a decision in by the georgia supreme court that diminished value coverage was included in auto policies under georgia law and the emergence of mold related homeowners losses in the state of texas during although from time to time we pursue various loss management initiatives in the allstate protection segment in order to mitigate future increases in claim severity  there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity 
our allstate protection segment has experienced a decline in claim frequency 
other participants in the industry have also experienced a similar decline 
we believe that this decrease may be attributable to a combination of several factors  including increases in the level of policy deductibles chosen by policyholders  improvements in car and road safety  aging of the population  increased driver education and restrictions for new drivers  decreases in policyholder submission of claims for minor losses  and our implementation of improved underwriting criteria 
the favorable level of claim frequency we have experienced may not be sustainable over the longer term 
a significant increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims recorded claim reserves in the property liability business are based on our best estimates of losses  both reported and incurred but not reported ibnr  after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances 
internal factors are considered including our experience with similar cases  actual claims paid  historical trends involving claim payment patterns  pending levels of unpaid claims  loss management programs  product mix  and contractual terms 
external factors are also considered which include but are not limited to law changes  court decisions  changes to regulatory requirements and economic conditions 
because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  is an inherently uncertain and complex process 
the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
predicting claim expense relating to asbestos and other environmental and discontinued lines is inherently uncertain the process of estimating asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues concerning  among other things  the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are  or were ever intended to be  covered  and whether losses could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium  reinsurance or other contractual agreements 
asbestos related bankruptcies and other asbestos litigations are complex  lengthy proceedings that involve substantial uncertainty for insurers 
while we believe that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted in estimating asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines net loss reserves  these refinements may subsequently prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss 
consequently  ultimate net losses from these discontinued lines could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  operating results and financial position 
regulation limiting rate increases and requiring us to underwrite business and participate in loss sharing arrangements may decrease our profitability from time to time  political events and positions affect the insurance market  including efforts to suppress rates to a level that may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability 
for example  when allstate protection s loss ratio compares favorably to that of the industry  state regulatory authorities may impose rate rollbacks  require us to pay premium refunds to policyholders  or resist or delay our efforts to raise rates even if the property and casualty industry generally is not experiencing regulatory resistance to rate increases 
such resistance affects our ability in all product lines to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to achieve targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity 
our ability to afford reinsurance required to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be dependent upon the ability to adjust rates for its cost 
in addition to regulating rates  certain states have enacted laws that require a property liability insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations or require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers  often restricting an insurer s ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge 
in these markets  we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates  possibly leading to an unacceptable return on equity  or as the facilities recognize a financial deficit  they may  in turn have the ability to assess participating insurers  adversely affecting our results of operations 
laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer s ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
additionally  certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies 
these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state 
our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors 
the potential benefits of implementing our sophisticated risk segmentation process tiered pricing may not be fully realized we believe that tiered pricing and underwriting including strategic risk management which  in some situations  considers information that is obtained from credit reports among other factors has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably 
however  because many of our competitors have adopted underwriting criteria and tiered pricing models similar to those we use and because other competitors may follow suit  we may lose our competitive advantage 
further  the use of insurance scoring from information that is obtained from credit reports as a factor in underwriting and pricing has at times been challenged by regulators  legislators  litigants and special interest groups in various states 
competitive pressures could also force us to modify our tiered pricing model 
furthermore  because we have been using tiered pricing only for the last several years  we can not be assured that tiered pricing models will accurately reflect the level of losses that we will ultimately incur from the mix of new business generated 
moreover  to the extent that competitive pressures limit our ability to attract new customers  our expectation that the amount of business written using tiered pricing will increase may not be realized 
allstate protection may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition  less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates  followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition  more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates 
a downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to the allstate financial segment changes in underwriting and actual experience could materially affect profitability our product pricing includes long term assumptions regarding investment returns  mortality  morbidity  persistency and operating costs and expenses of the business 
management establishes target returns for each product based upon these factors and the average amount of capital that the company must hold to support in force contracts  satisfy rating agencies and meet regulatory requirements 
we monitor and manage our pricing and overall sales mix to achieve target returns on a portfolio basis 
profitability from new business emerges over a period of years depending on the nature and life of the product and is subject to variability as actual results may differ from pricing assumptions 
our profitability in this segment depends on the adequacy of investment margins  the management of market and credit risks associated with investments  the sufficiency of premiums and contract charges to cover mortality and morbidity benefits  the persistency of policies to ensure recovery of acquisition expenses  and the management of operating costs and expenses within anticipated pricing allowances 
legislation and regulation of the insurance marketplace and products could also affect our profitability 
changes in reserve estimates may reduce profitability reserve for life contingent contract benefits is computed on the basis of long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields  mortality  morbidity  policy terminations and expenses 
we periodically review the adequacy of these reserves on an aggregate basis and if future experience differs significantly from assumptions  adjustments to reserves may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
changes in market interest rates may lead to a significant decrease in the sales and profitability of spread based products our ability to manage the allstate financial investment margin for spread based products  such as fixed annuities and institutional products  is dependent upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates 
when market interest rates decrease or remain at relatively low levels  proceeds from investments that have matured  prepaid or been sold may be reinvested at lower yields  reducing investment margin 
lowering interest crediting rates in such an environment can offset decreases in investment yield on some products 
however  these changes could be limited by market conditions  regulatory or contractual minimum rate guarantees on many contracts and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields 
decreases in the rates offered on products in the financial segment could make those products less attractive  leading to lower sales and or changes in the level of surrenders and withdrawals for these products 
non parallel shifts in interest rates  such as increases in short term rates without accompanying increases in medium and long term rates  can influence customer demand for fixed annuities  which could impact the level and profitability of new customer deposits 
increases in market interest rates can also have negative effects on allstate financial  for example by increasing the attractiveness of other investments to our customers  which can lead to higher surrenders at a time when the segment s fixed income investment asset values are lower as a result of the increase in interest rates 
for certain products  principally fixed annuity and interest sensitive life products  the earned rate on assets could lag behind rising market yields 
we may react to market conditions by increasing crediting rates  which could narrow spreads 
unanticipated surrenders could result in deferred policy acquisition costs dac unlocking or affect the recoverability of dac and thereby increase expenses and reduce profitability 
changes in estimates of profitability on interest sensitive life  fixed annuities and other investment products may have an adverse effect on results through increased amortization of dac dac related to interest sensitive life  fixed annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to actual historical gross profits and estimated future gross profits egp over the estimated lives of the contracts 
assumptions underlying egp  including those relating to margins from mortality  investment margin  contract administration  surrender and other contract charges  are updated from time to time in order to reflect actual and expected experience and its potential effect on the valuation of dac 
updates to these assumptions could result in dac unlocking  which in turn could adversely affect our net income and financial condition 
a loss of key product distribution relationships could materially affect sales certain products in the allstate financial segment are distributed under agreements with other members of the financial services industry that are not affiliated with us 
termination of one or more of these agreements due to  for example  a change in control of one of these distributors  could have a detrimental effect on the sales of allstate financial 
changes in tax laws may decrease sales and profitability of products under current federal and state income tax law  certain products we offer  primarily life insurance and annuities  receive favorable tax treatment 
this favorable treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over noninsurance products 
congress from time to time considers legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities 
congress also considers proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance and annuities 
legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage or create a disadvantage for certain of our products making them less competitive 
such proposals  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or ability to sell such products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies 
in addition  changes in the federal estate tax laws could negatively affect the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning 
risks relating to the insurance industry our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive the insurance industry is highly competitive 
our competitors include other insurers and  because many of our products include a savings or investment component  securities firms  investment advisers  mutual funds  banks and other financial institutions 
many of our competitors have well established national reputations and market similar products 
because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry  including competition for producers such as exclusive and independent agents  there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals  or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
the ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may have a material adverse effect on all of our product lines by substantially increasing the number  size and financial strength of potential competitors 
furthermore  certain competitors operate using a mutual insurance company structure and therefore  may have dissimilar profitability and return targets 
we are subject to market risk and declines in credit quality we are subject to market risk  the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity  interest  commodity or foreign currency exchange rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices and  to a lesser degree  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
in addition  we are subject to potential declines in credit quality  either related to issues specific to certain industries or to a weakening in the economy in general 
for additional information on market risk  see the market risk section of management s discussion and analysis 
a decline in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may yield less than the portfolio s average rate 
in a declining interest rate environment  borrowers may prepay or redeem securities more quickly than expected as they seek to refinance at lower rates 
a decline could also lead us to purchase longer term assets in order to obtain adequate investment yields resulting in a duration gap when compared to the duration of liabilities 
an increase in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial majority of our investment portfolio 
increases in interest rates also may lead to an increase in policy loans  surrenders and withdrawals that generally would be funded at a time when fair values of fixed income securities are lower 
a declining equity market could also cause the investments in our pension plans to decrease or decreasing interest rates could cause the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans or the accumulated benefit obligation of our other post retirement benefit plans to increase  either or both resulting in a decrease in the funded status of the plans and a reduction of shareholders equity  increases in pension expense and increases in required contributions to the pension plans 
a decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause additional realized losses on securities  including realized losses relating to derivative strategies 
concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects the concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry  group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our results of operations and financial position 
while we seek to mitigate this risk by having a broadly diversified portfolio  events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry  group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated rather than diversified 
we may suffer losses from litigation as is typical for a large company  we are involved in a substantial amount of litigation  including class action litigation challenging a range of company practices and coverage provided by our insurance products 
in the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters  the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and may be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular quarter or annual period 
for a description of our current legal proceedings  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
in some circumstances  we may be able to collect on third party insurance that we carry to recover all or part of the amounts that we may be required to pay in judgments  settlements and litigation expenses 
however  we may not be able to resolve issues concerning the availability  if any  or the ability to collect such insurance concurrently with the underlying litigation 
consequently  the timing of the resolution of a particular piece of litigation and the determination of our insurance recovery with respect to that litigation may not coincide and  therefore  may be reflected in our financial statements in different fiscal quarters 
we are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth as insurance companies  broker dealers  investment advisers and or investment companies  many of our subsidiaries are subject to extensive laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations are complex and subject to change 
moreover  they are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities  including state insurance regulators  state securities administrators  the sec  the national association of securities dealers  the us department of justice  and state attorneys general  each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude 
consequently  we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of the same issue  particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight 
in addition  there is risk that any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment  or that changes in the overall legal environment may  even absent any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue changing  cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective  thus necessitating changes to our practices that may  in some cases  limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business 
furthermore  in some cases  these laws and regulations are designed to protect or benefit the interests of a specific constituency rather than a range of constituencies 
for example  state insurance laws and regulations are generally intended to protect or benefit purchasers or users of insurance products  not holders of securities issued by the allstate corporation 
in many respects  these laws and regulations limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business 
in recent years  the state insurance regulatory framework has come under public scrutiny and members of congress have discussed proposals to provide for optional federal chartering of insurance companies 
we can make no assurances regarding the potential impact of state or federal measures that may change the nature or scope of insurance regulation 
reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices  which may limit our ability to write new business market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase 
no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available 
our ability to afford reinsurance required to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be dependent upon the ability to adjust rates for its cost 
if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable  we would have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk  reduce our insurance writings  or develop or seek other alternatives 
reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded insurance the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors  including whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers  or their affiliates  have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract 
our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may adversely affect the level of claim losses we incur and the value of our investment portfolio the continued threat of terrorism  both within the united states and abroad  and ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats  may cause significant volatility and losses from declines in the equity markets and from interest rate changes in the united states  europe and elsewhere  and result in loss of life  property damage  additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity 
some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism 
we seek to mitigate the potential impact of terrorism on our commercial mortgage portfolio by limiting geographical concentrations in key metropolitan areas and by requiring terrorism insurance to the extent that it is commercially available 
additionally  in the event that terrorist acts occur  both allstate protection and allstate financial could be adversely affected  depending on the nature of the event 
any decrease in our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance company s business 
on an ongoing basis  rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer s ratings due to  for example  a change in an insurer s statutory capital  a change in a rating agency s determination of the amount of risk adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating  an increase in the perceived risk of an insurer s investment portfolio  a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be under the insurer s control 
the insurance financial strength ratings of both allstate insurance company and allstate life insurance company are a  aa and aa from am best  standard poor s and moody s  respectively 
several other affiliates have been assigned their own financial strength ratings by one or more rating agencies 
because all of these ratings are subject to continuous review  the retention of these ratings cannot be assured 
a multiple level downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our sales  our competitiveness  the marketability of our product offerings  and our liquidity  operating results and financial condition 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles  which is periodically revised and or expanded 
accordingly  we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies  including the fasb 
it is possible that future changes we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition 
for a description of potential changes in accounting standards that could affect us currently  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends may affect our liquidity and ability to meet our obligations the allstate corporation is a holding company with no significant operations 
the principal asset is the stock of its subsidiaries 
state insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries  as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  competitive pressures generally require the subsidiaries to maintain insurance financial strength ratings 
these restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make dividend payments 
limits on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity  including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders  service our debt and complete share repurchase programs in the timeframe expected 
the occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning could impair our ability to conduct business effectively in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe  an industrial accident  a terrorist attack or war  events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition  particularly if those events affect our computer based data processing  transmission  storage and retrieval systems 
in the event that a significant number of our managers could be unavailable in the event of a disaster  our ability to effectively conduct our business could be severely compromised

we use operating ratios to measure the profitability of our property liability results 
we believe that they enhance an investor s understanding of our profitability 
they are calculated as follows claims and claims expense loss ratio is the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses 
expense ratio is the ratio of amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
combined ratio is the ratio of claims and claims expense  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
the difference between and the combined ratio represents underwriting income loss as a percentage of premiums earned

it is reasonably likely that changes in these estimates could occur from period to period and result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a brief summary of each of these critical accounting estimates follows 
for a more detailed discussion of the effect of these estimates on our consolidated financial statements  and the judgments and assumptions related to these estimates  see the referenced sections of the md a 
for a complete summary of our significant accounting policies see note of the consolidated financial statements 
investment valuation the fair value of publicly traded fixed income and equity securities is based on independent market quotations  whereas the fair value of non publicly traded securities is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models  which use internally developed ratings and independent third party data as inputs  or independent third party pricing sources 
factors used in our internally developed models  such as liquidity risk associated with privately placed securities  are difficult to independently observe and quantify 
because of this  judgment is required in developing certain of these estimates and  as a result  the estimated fair value of non publicly traded securities may differ from amounts that would be realized upon an immediate sale of the securities 
for investments classified as available for sale  the difference between fair value and amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities  net of deferred income taxes and certain other items as disclosed in note  is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of financial position and is not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third party or when declines in fair values are deemed other than temporary 
the assessment of other than temporary impairment of a security s fair value is performed on a portfolio review as well as a case by case basis considering a wide range of factors 
for our portfolio review evaluations  we ascertain whether there are any approved programs involving the disposition of investments such as changes in duration  revision to strategic asset allocations and liquidity actions  and any dispositions anticipated by the portfolio managers 
in these instances  we recognize impairment on securities being considered for these approved anticipated actions if the security is in an unrealized loss position 
there are a number of assumptions and estimates inherent in evaluating impairments and determining if they are other than temporary  including our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  the expected recoverability of principal and interest  the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities  the financial condition  near term and long term prospects of the issuer  including relevant industry conditions and trends  and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices  and the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position  including market conditions which could affect liquidity 
additionally  once assumptions and estimates are made  any number of changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to later determine that an impairment is other than temporary  including general economic conditions that are worse than previously assumed or that have a greater adverse effect on a particular issuer than originally estimated  changes in the facts and circumstances related to a particular issuer s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations  and changes in facts and circumstances or new information obtained which causes a change in our ability or intent to hold a security to maturity or until it recovers in value 
changes in assumptions  facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods to the extent that losses are realized 
the charge to earnings  while potentially significant to net income  would not have a significant effect on shareholders equity since the majority of our portfolio is carried at fair value and as a result  any related net unrealized loss would already be reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity

derivative instrument hedge effectiveness we primarily use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risk and in conjunction with asset liability management  particularly in the allstate financial segment 
the fair value of exchange traded derivative contracts is based on independent market quotations  whereas the fair value of non exchange traded derivative contracts is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models which use independent third party data as inputs or independent third party pricing sources 
when derivatives meet specific criteria  they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value  cash flow  foreign currency fair value  or foreign currency cash flow hedges 
when designating a derivative as an accounting hedge  we formally document the hedging relationship  risk management objective and strategy 
the documentation identifies the hedging instrument  the hedged item  the nature of the risk being hedged and the assumptions used to assess how effective the hedging instrument is in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item s fair value attributable to the hedged risk 
in the case of a cash flow hedge  this documentation includes the exposure to changes in the hedged transaction s variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk 
we do not exclude any component of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument from the effectiveness assessment 
at each reporting date  we confirm that the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective in offsetting the hedged risk

deferred policy acquisition cost dac amortization we incur significant costs in connection with acquiring business 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business are deferred and recorded as an asset on the consolidated statements of financial position 
dac related to property liability contracts is amortized to income as premiums are earned  typically over periods of six to twelve months 
the amortization methodology for dac for allstate financial policies and contracts includes significant assumptions and estimates 
dac related to traditional life insurance is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business 
significant assumptions relating to estimated premiums  investment income and realized capital gains and losses  as well as to all other aspects of dac are determined based upon conditions as of the date of policy issuance and are generally not revised during the life of the policy 
any deviations from projected business in force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels and any estimated premium deficiencies change the rate of amortization in the period such events occur 
generally  the amortization periods for these contracts approximate the estimated lives of the policies 
dac related to interest sensitive life  annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to the incidence of the total present value of gross profits which includes both actual historical gross profits agp and estimated future gross profits egp expected to be earned over the estimated lives of the contracts 
actual amortization periods range from years  however  incorporating estimates of customer surrender rates  partial withdrawals and deaths generally results in the majority of the dac being amortized over the surrender charge period 
agp and egp consist of the following components benefit margins primarily from mortality  investment margin including realized capital gains and losses  and contract administration  surrender and other contract charges  less maintenance expenses 
we periodically review and make revisions to egps resulting in changes in the cumulative amounts expensed as a component of amortization of dac in the period in which the revision is made 
this is commonly known as dac unlocking

reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense estimation reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims and claims expenses under insurance policies we issued 
property liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves 
these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr  as of the financial statement date 
characteristics of reserves reserves are established independently of business segment management for each business segment and line of business based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle claims  less losses that have been paid 
the significant lines of business for allstate protection are auto  homeowners  and other lines 
for discontinued lines and coverages  they are asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines 
allstate protection s claims are typically reported promptly with relatively little reporting lag between the date of occurrence and the date of loss report 
auto and homeowners liability losses generally take an average of about two years to settle  while auto physical damage  homeowners property and other personal lines have an average settlement time of less than one year 
discontinued lines and coverages involve long tail losses  such as those related to asbestos and environmental claims  which often involve substantial reporting lags and extended times to settle 
reserves are the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of losses incurred and the amount of paid losses as of the reporting date 
reserves are estimated for both reported and unreported claims  and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling all incurred claims 
we update our reserve estimates quarterly and as new information becomes available or as events unfold that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims 
changes in prior year reserve estimates reserve reestimates  which may be material  are determined by comparing updated estimates of ultimate losses to prior estimates  and the differences are recorded as property liability insurance claims and claims expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period such changes are determined 
estimating the ultimate cost of claims and claims expenses is an inherently uncertain and complex process involving a high degree of judgment and is subject to evaluation of numerous variables 
the actuarial methods used to develop reserve estimates reserves estimates are derived by using several different actuarial estimation methods that are variations on one primary actuarial technique 
this actuarial technique is known as a chain ladder estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses paid losses plus individual case reserves established by claim adjusters for an accident year or a report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time 
an accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred 
a report year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims are reported 
both classifications are used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future 
the key assumptions affecting our reserve estimates comprise data elements including claim counts  paid losses  case reserves  and development factors calculated with this data 
in the chain ladder estimation technique  a ratio development factor is calculated which compares current period results to results in the prior period for each accident year 
a three year or two year average development factor  based on historical results  is usually multiplied by the current period experience to estimate the development of losses of each accident year into the next time period 
the development factors for the future time periods for each accident year are compounded over the remaining future periods to calculate an estimate of ultimate losses for each accident year 
the implicit assumption of this technique is that an average of historical development factors is predictive of future loss development  as the significant size of our experience data base achieves a high degree of statistical credibility in actuarial projections of this type 
the effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process  the implicit assumption being that a multi year average development factor includes an adequate provision 
occasionally  unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by external and internal factors such as changes in claim reporting  settlement patterns  unusually large losses  process changes  legal or regulatory changes  and other influences 
in these instances  analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors  and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses 
how reserve estimates are established and updated reserve estimates are developed at a very detailed level  and the results of these numerous micro level best estimates are aggregated to form a consolidated reserve estimate 
for example  over one thousand actuarial estimates of the types described above are prepared each quarter to estimate losses for each line of insurance  major components of losses such as coverages and perils  major states or groups of states and for reported losses and ibnr 
the actuarial methods described above are used to analyze the settlement patterns of claims by determining the development factors for specific data elements that are necessary components of a reserve estimation process 
development factors are calculated quarterly for data elements such as  claim counts reported and settled  paid losses  and paid losses combined with case reserves 
the calculation of development factors from changes in these data elements also impacts claim severity average cost per claim trends  which is a common industry reference used to explain changes in reserve estimates 
the historical development patterns for these data elements are used as the assumptions to calculate reserve estimates 
often  several different estimates are prepared for each detailed component  incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses  from which we select our best estimate for each component  occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment  as described above 
these micro level estimates are not based on a single set of assumptions 
actuarial judgments that may be applied to these components of certain micro level estimates generally do not have a material impact on the consolidated level of reserves 
moreover  this detailed micro level process does not permit or result in a compilation of a company wide roll up to generate a range of needed loss reserves that would be meaningful 
based on our review of these estimates  our best estimate of required reserves for each state line coverage component is recorded for each accident year  and the required reserves for each component are summed to create the reserve balances carried on our consolidated statements of financial position 
reserves are reestimated quarterly  by combining historical results with current actual results to calculate new development factors 
this process incorporates the historic and latest actual trends  and other underlying changes in the data elements used to calculate reserve estimates 
new development factors are likely to differ from previous development factors used in prior reserve estimates because actual results claims reported or settled  losses paid  or changes to case reserves occur differently than the implied assumptions contained in the previous development factor calculations 
if claims reported  paid losses  or case reserves changes are greater or lower than the levels estimated by previous development factors  reserve reestimates increase or decrease 
when actual development of these data elements is different than the historical development pattern used in a prior period reserve estimate  a new reserve is determined 
the difference between indicated reserves based on new reserve estimates and recorded reserves the previous estimate is the amount of reserve reestimate and an increase or decrease in property liability insurance claims and claims expense will be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
total property liability reserve reestimates  after tax  as a percent of net income  from  and were  and  respectively 
for property liability  the year average of reserve reestimate as a percentage of total reserves was favorable reestimate  for allstate protection the year average of reserve estimates was a favorable and for discontinued lines and coverages the year average of reserve reestimates was an unfavorable  each of these results being consistent within a reasonable actuarial tolerance for our respective businesses 
allstate protection reserve reestimates were primarily the result of claim severity development that was better than expected and late reported loss development that was better than expected due to lower frequency trends  and for discontinued lines and coverages  reestimates were primarily a result of increased reported claim activity claims frequency 
a more detailed discussion of reserve reestimates is presented in the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of the md a 
the following table shows claims and claims expense reserves by operating segment and line of business as of december in millions allstate protection auto    homeowners    other lines    total allstate protection    discontinued lines and coverages asbestos    environmental other discontinued lines total discontinued lines and coverages    total property liability    allstate protection reserve estimates factors affecting reserve estimates reserve estimates are developed based on the processes and historical development trends as previously described 
these estimates are considered in conjunction with known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including our experience with similar cases  actual claims paid  differing payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims  loss management programs  product mix and contractual terms  changes in law and regulation  judicial decisions  and economic conditions 
when we experience changes of the type previously mentioned  we may need to apply actuarial judgment in the determination and selection of development factors considered more reflective of the new trends  such as combining shorter or longer periods of historical results with current actual results to produce development factors based on two year  three year  or longer development periods to reestimate our reserves 
for example  if a legal change is expected to have a significant impact on the development of claim severity for a coverage which is part of a particular line of insurance in a specific state  actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors that will most accurately reflect the expected impact in that specific estimate 
another example would be when a change in economic conditions is expected to affect the cost of repairs to damaged autos or property for a particular line  coverage  or state  actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors to use in the reserve estimate that will most accurately reflect the expected impacts on severity development 
as claims are reported  for certain liability claims of sufficient size and complexity  the field adjusting staff establishes case reserve estimates of ultimate cost  based on their assessment of facts and circumstances related to each individual claim 
for other claims which occur in large volumes and settle in a relatively short time frame  it is not practical or efficient to set case reserves for each claim  and a statistical case reserve is set for these claims based on estimating techniques previously described 
in the normal course of business  we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters  appraisers  engineers  inspectors  other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims 
historically  the case reserves set by the field adjusting staff have not proven to be an entirely accurate estimate of the ultimate cost of claims 
to provide for this  a development reserve is estimated using previously described processes  and allocated to pending claims as a supplement to case reserves 
typically  the case and supplemental development reserves comprise about of total reserves 
another major component of reserves is ibnr 
typically  ibnr comprises about of total reserves 
generally  the initial reserves for a new accident year are established based on severity assumptions for different business segments  lines  and coverages based on historical relationships to relevant inflation indicators  and reserves for prior accident years are statistically determined using processes previously described 
changes in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy 
we mitigate these effects through various loss management programs 
injury claims are affected largely by medical cost inflation while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation and used car prices 
for auto physical damage coverages  we monitor our rate of increase in average cost per claim against a weighted average of the maintenance and repair price index and the parts equipment price index 
we believe our claim settlement initiatives  such as improvements to the claim review and settlement process  the use of special investigative units to detect fraud and handle suspect claims  litigation management and defense strategies  as well as various other loss management initiatives underway  contribute to the mitigation of injury and physical damage severity trends 
changes in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials  the cost of construction and property repair services  the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents  the types of claims that qualify for coverage  deductibles and other economic and environmental factors 
we employ various loss management programs to mitigate the effect of these factors 
as loss experience for the current year develops for each type of loss  it is monitored relative to initial assumptions until it is judged to have sufficient statistical credibility 
from that point in time and forward  reserves are re estimated using statistical actuarial processes to reflect the impact actual loss trends have on development factors incorporated into the actuarial estimation processes 
statistical credibility is usually achieved by the end of the first calendar year  however  when trends for the current accident year exceed initial assumptions sooner  they are usually given credibility  and reserves are increased accordingly 
the very detailed processes for developing reserve estimates and the lack of a need and existence of a common set of assumptions or development factors  limits aggregate reserve level testing for variability of data elements 
however  by applying standard actuarial methods to consolidated historic accident year loss data for major loss types  comprising auto injury losses  auto physical damage losses and homeowner losses  we develop variability analyses consistent with the way we develop reserves by measuring the potential variability of development factors  as described in the section titled  potential reserve estimate variability below 
causes of reserve estimate uncertainty since reserves are estimates of the unpaid portions of claims and claims expenses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  requires regular reevaluation and refinement of estimates to determine our ultimate loss estimate 
at each reporting date  the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year 
the greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because the current accident year contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled but must be estimated as of the current reporting date 
most of these losses relate to damaged property such as automobiles and homes  and to medical care for injuries from accidents 
during the first year after the end of an accident year  a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled 
when accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates  the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly 
consequently  this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest reestimates of losses for an accident year 
after the second year  the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle  such as those involving serious injuries or litigation 
private passenger auto insurance provides a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates our typical annual percentage payout of reserves for an accident year is approximately in the first year after the end of the accident year  in the second year  in the third year  in the fourth year  and the remaining thereafter 
reserves for catastrophe losses property liability claims and claims expense reserves also include reserves for catastrophe losses 
catastrophe losses are an inherent risk of the property liability insurance industry that have contributed  and will continue to contribute  to potentially material year to year fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position 
we define a catastrophe as an event that produces pretax losses before reinsurance in excess of million and involves multiple first party policyholders  or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset  per event threshold of average claims in a specific area  occurring within a certain amount of time following the event 
catastrophes are caused by various natural events including earthquakes  volcanoes  wildfires  tornadoes  hailstorms  hurricanes  tropical storms  high winds and winter storms 
we are also exposed to man made catastrophic events  such as certain acts of terrorism or industrial accidents 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted 
the estimation of claims and claims expense reserves for catastrophes also comprises estimates of losses from reported claims and ibnr  primarily for damage to property 
in general  our estimates for catastrophe reserves are based on claim adjuster inspections and the application of historical loss development factors as described previously 
however  depending on the nature of the catastrophe  as noted above  the estimation process can be further complicated 
for example  for hurricanes  complications could include the inability of insureds to be able to promptly report losses  limitations placed on claims adjusting staff affecting their ability to inspect losses  determining whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy generally for damage caused by wind or wind driven rain  or specifically excluded coverage caused by flood  estimating additional living expenses  and assessing the impact of demand surge  exposure to mold damage  and the effects of numerous other considerations  including the timing of a catastrophe in relation to other events  such as at or near the end of a financial reporting period  which can affect the availability of information needed to estimate reserves for that reporting period 
in these situations  we may need to adapt our practices to accommodate these circumstances in order to determine a best estimate of our loss from a catastrophe 
as an example  to complete an estimate for certain areas affected by hurricane katrina and not yet inspected by our claims adjusting staff  or where we believed our historical loss development factors were not predictive  we relied on analysis of actual claim notices received compared to total policies in force  as well as visual  governmental and third party information  including aerial photos  area observations  and data on wind speed and flood depth to the extent available 
potential reserve estimate variability the aggregation of numerous micro level estimates for each business segment  line of insurance  major components of losses such as coverages and perils  and major states or groups of states for reported losses and ibnr forms the reserve liability recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position 
because of this detailed approach to developing our reserve estimates  there is not a single set of assumptions that determine our reserve estimates at the consolidated level 
moreover  management does not compile a range of reserve estimates  because management does not believe the processes that we follow will produce a statistically credible or reliable actuarial reserve range that would be meaningful 
reserve estimates  by their very nature  are very complex to determine and subject to significant judgment  and do not represent an exact determination for each outstanding claim 
accordingly  as actual claims  and or paid losses  and or case reserve results emerge  our estimate of the ultimate cost to settle will be different than previously estimated 
to develop a statistical indication of potential reserve variability within reasonably likely possible outcomes  an actuarial stochastic modeling technique is applied to the countrywide consolidated data elements for paid losses and paid losses combined with case reserves separately for injury losses  auto physical damage losses  and homeowners losses excluding catastrophe losses 
based on the combined historical variability of the development factors calculated for these data elements an estimate of the standard error or standard deviation around these reserve estimates is calculated within each accident year for the last eleven years for each type of loss 
the variability of these reserve estimates within one standard deviation of the mean a measure of frequency of dispersion often viewed to be an acceptable level of accuracy is believed by management to represent a reasonable and statistically probable measure of potential variability 
based on our products and coverages  historical experience  the statistical credibility of our extensive data  and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder methodologies used to develop reserve estimates  we estimate that the potential variability of our allstate protection reserves  after tax  within a reasonable probability of other possible outcomes  may be approximately plus or minus  or plus or minus million in net income 
a lower level of variability exists for auto injury losses  which comprise approximately of reserves  due to their relatively stable development patterns over a longer duration of time required to settle claims 
other types of losses  such as auto physical damage  homeowners losses and other losses  which comprise about of reserves  tend to have greater variability  but are settled in a much shorter period of time 
although this evaluation reflects most reasonably likely outcomes  it is possible the final outcome may fall below or above these amounts 
historical variability of reserve estimates is reported in the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of the md a 
adequacy of reserve estimates we believe our net claims and claims expense reserves are appropriately established based on available methodology  facts  technology  laws and regulations 
we calculate and record a single best reserve estimate  in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards  for each line of insurance  its components coverages and perils  and state  for reported losses and for ibnr losses and as a result we believe that no other estimate is better than our recorded amount 
due to the uncertainties involved  the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts  which are based on our best estimates 
discontinued lines and coverages reserve estimates characteristics of discontinued lines exposure we continue to receive asbestos and environmental claims 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by people who were exposed to asbestos or products containing asbestos 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up costs 
our exposure to asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises principally from assumed reinsurance coverage written during the s through the mid s  including reinsurance on primary insurance written on large united states companies  and from direct excess insurance written from through  including substantial excess general liability coverages on fortune companies 
additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the s through the mid s 
other discontinued lines exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims  such as those for medical devices and other products 
in  the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property liability industry was amended to introduce an absolute pollution exclusion  which excluded coverage for environmental damage claims  and to add an asbestos exclusion 
most general liability policies issued prior to contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage 
general liability policies issued in and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all coverages 
our experience to date is that these policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks 
our exposure to liability for asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage  direct excess insurance  or direct primary commercial insurance 
the direct insurance coverage we provided that covered asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines was substantially excess in nature 
direct excess insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans 
the nature of excess coverage and reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention on primary insurance plans 
our exposure is further limited by the significant reinsurance that we had purchased on our direct excess business 
our assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers reinsurance programs 
the reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions 
the majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure  approximately  is for excess of loss coverage  while the remaining is for pro rata coverage 
our direct primary commercial insurance business did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers 
this business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many diverse business sectors located throughout the country 
how reserve estimates are established and updated we conduct an annual review in the third quarter of each year to evaluate and establish asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines reserves 
reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined 
using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment  this detailed and comprehensive ground up methodology determines asbestos reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure eg claim activity  potential liability  jurisdiction  products versus non products exposure presented by individual policyholders  and determines environmental reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure eg environmental damages  respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties  appropriateness and cost of remediation to pollution and related clean up costs 
the number and cost of these claims is affected by intense advertising by trial lawyers seeking asbestos plaintiffs  and entities with asbestos exposure seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos liabilities  initially causing a delay in the reporting of claims  often followed by an acceleration and an increase in claims and claims expenses as settlements occur 
after evaluating our insureds probable liabilities for asbestos and or environmental claims  we evaluate our insureds coverage programs for such claims 
we consider our insureds total available insurance coverage  including the coverage we issued 
we also consider relevant judicial interpretations of policy language and applicable coverage defenses or determinations  if any 
evaluation of both the insureds estimated liabilities and our exposure to the insureds depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment 
this analysis is conducted by our specialized claims adjusting staff and legal counsel 
based on these evaluations  case reserves are established by claims adjusting staff and actuarial analysis is employed to develop an ibnr reserve  which includes estimated potential reserve development and claims that have occurred but have not been reported 
as of december   ibnr was of combined asbestos and environmental reserves 
for both asbestos and environmental reserves  we also evaluate our historical direct net loss and expense paid and incurred experience to assess any emerging trends  fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and incurred activity 
other discontinued lines and coverages reserves for other discontinued lines provide for remaining loss and loss expense liabilities related to business no longer written by us  other than asbestos and environmental  and are presented in the following table 
in millions other mass torts workers compensation commercial and other other discontinued lines other mass torts describes direct excess and reinsurance general liability coverage provided for cumulative injury losses other than asbestos and environmental 
workers compensation and commercial and other include run off from discontinued direct primary  direct excess and reinsurance commercial insurance operations of various coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental 
reserves are based on considerations similar to those previously described  as they relate to the characteristics of specific individual coverage exposures 
potential reserve estimate variability establishing discontinued lines and coverages net loss reserves for asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other types of claims 
among the complications are lack of historical data  long reporting delays  uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure and unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage  unresolved legal issues regarding the determination  availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits  plaintiffs evolving and expanding theories of liability  availability and collectibility of recoveries from reinsurance  retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements  estimates of the extent and timing of any contractual liability  the impact of bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants  and other uncertainties 
there are also complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered  or were ever intended to be covered  and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium  reinsurance or other contractual agreements 
courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage  what types of losses are covered  whether there is an insurer obligation to defend  how policy limits are determined  how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted  and whether clean up costs represent insured property damage 
our reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures could be affected by tort reform  class action litigation  and other potential legislation and judicial decisions 
environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal superfund law and similar state statutes 
there can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair  effective and cost efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims 
we believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future  and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves 
historical variability of reserve estimates is demonstrated in the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of the md a 
adequacy of reserve estimates management believes its net loss reserves for environmental  asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts  technology  laws  regulations  and assessments of other pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure eg claim activity  potential liability  jurisdiction  products versus non products exposure presented by individual policyholders  assuming no change in the legal  legislative or economic environment 
due to the uncertainties and factors described above  management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required

reserve for life contingent contract benefits estimation long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields  mortality  morbidity  policy terminations and expenses are used when establishing the reserve for life contingent contract benefits 
these assumptions  which for life contingent annuities and traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium method  include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by such characteristics as type of annuity benefit or coverage  year of issue and policy duration 
future investment yield assumptions are determined at the time the policy is issued based upon prevailing investment yields as well as estimated reinvestment yields 
mortality  morbidity and policy termination assumptions are based on our experience and industry experience prevailing at the time the policies are issued 
expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and expenses to be incurred beyond the premium paying period

prior year favorable net reserve reestimates in totaled million compared to million in  including reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses of million favorable in and million unfavorable in property liability operations overview our property liability operations consist of two business segments allstate protection and discontinued lines and coverages 
allstate protection is structured around two brands  the allstate brand and encompass brand 
allstate protection is principally engaged in the sale of personal property and casualty insurance  primarily private passenger auto and homeowners insurance  to individuals in the united states and canada 
discontinued lines and coverages includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off 
these segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources 
underwriting income loss  is not a gaap measure and is reconciled to net income on page it is calculated as premiums earned  less claims and claims expense losses  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges  as determined using gaap 
we use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the property liability insurance operations separately from investment results 
it is also an integral component of incentive compensation 
it is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance 
underwriting income loss should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business 
net income is the gaap measure most directly comparable to underwriting income loss 
the table below includes gaap operating ratios we use to measure our profitability 
we believe that they enhance an investor s understanding of our profitability 
they are calculated as follows claims and claims expense loss ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses 
expense ratio the ratio of amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
the difference between and the combined ratio represents underwriting income loss as a percentage of premiums earned 
we have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the gaap operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods 
effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio the percentage of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expenses to premiums earned 
this ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates

effect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio the percentage of restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
effect of discontinued lines and coverages on combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense and other costs and expenses in the discontinued lines and coverages segment to property liability premiums earned 
the sum of the effect of discontinued lines and coverages on the combined ratio and the allstate protection combined ratio is equal to the property liability combined ratio

the encompass brand includes standard auto and homeowners products while the deerbrook brand is used for non standard auto products 
the key elements of the allstate protection strategy are investing in marketing and brand awareness improving the customer experience expanding distribution utilizing sophisticated pricing and underwriting discipline developing innovative and differentiated products leveraging claims capabilities we are seeking  through the utilization of our distribution channels  our sophisticated risk segmentation process tiered pricing and consumer marketing  to attract and retain high lifetime value customers who will potentially provide favorable prospects for profitability over the course of their relationship with us 
we maintain a broad marketing approach throughout the us we have aligned agency and management compensation and the overall strategies of the allstate brand to best serve our customers by basing certain incentives on allstate brand profitability  unit growth  retention  and sales of financial products 
we differentiate the allstate brand from competitors by offering a choice of products  including our innovative allstate your choice auto yca with options such as safe driving deductibles and a safe driving bonus  allstate your choice homeowners ych with options such as claims free bonus and personalized coverage and allstate blue sm our new non standard auto product with features such as loyalty bonuses and roadside assistance  as well as other discount options available depending on a consumer s needs 
tiered pricing and underwriting are designed to enhance both our competitive position and profit potential  and produce a broader range of premiums that is more refined than the range generated by the standard non standard model 
tiered pricing includes our strategic risk management program  which uses a number of risk evaluation factors including  to the extent legally permissible  insurance scoring based on information that is obtained from credit reports 
we continue to expand the number of tiers with successive rating program releases 
substantially all of new and approximately of renewal business written for allstate brand auto uses tiered pricing 
for allstate brand homeowners  approximately of new and of renewal business written uses tiered pricing 
for allstate brand auto and homeowners business written under tiered pricing  our results indicate a shift toward more customers who we consider high lifetime value that generally are retained longer and have more favorable loss results 
as we continue to use tiered pricing  there is a diminishing capacity to draw meaningful comparisons to historical presentations  including the distinctions between standard and non standard which have become less relevant in certain states 
generally  standard auto customers are expected to have lower risks of loss than non standard auto customers 
we are pursuing improvements in the overall customer experience through actions targeted to increase customer satisfaction and retention 
these programs are designed around establishing customer service expectations and customer relationship building 
our claims strategy focuses on delivering fast  fair and consistent claim service while achieving loss cost management and customer satisfaction 
we continue to enhance technology to integrate our distribution channels  improve customer service  facilitate the introduction of new products and services and reduce infrastructure costs related to supporting agencies and handling claims 
these actions and others are designed to optimize the effectiveness of our distribution and service channels by increasing the productivity of the allstate brand s exclusive agencies and our direct channels the internet and call centers 
our strategy for the encompass brand includes enhancing pricing and product sophistication through our tiered pricing approach encompass edge  increasing distribution effectiveness and improving agency technology interfaces to support profitable growth 
we are positioning the brand to expand product breadth and improve agency penetration by leveraging technology and service capabilities we continue to pursue our strategy to manage our property catastrophe exposure to provide our shareholders an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce the variability of our earnings  while providing protection to our customers 
although in many areas of the country we are currently achieving returns within acceptable risk tolerances  we continue to seek solutions to improve returns in areas that have known exposure to hurricanes  earthquakes  fires following earthquakes and other catastrophes 
management s measurements for our property business include exposure limits based on hurricane and earthquake losses which have a one percent probability of occurring on an annual aggregate countrywide basis 
we are working for changes in the regulatory environment  including fewer restrictions on underwriting  recognizing the need for and improving appropriate risk based pricing and promoting the creation of government sponsored  privately funded solutions 
our property business includes personal homeowners  commercial property and other property lines 
while the actions that we take will be primarily focused on reducing the catastrophe exposure in our property business  we also consider their impact on our ability to market our auto lines 
pricing of property products is typically intended to establish returns that we deem acceptable over a long term period 
losses  including losses from catastrophic events and weather related losses such as wind  hail  lightning and freeze losses not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe are accrued on an occurrence basis within the policy period 
therefore  in any reporting period  loss experience from catastrophic events and weather related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations we incorporated into the products pricing 
accordingly  property products are more capital intensive than other personal lines products 
premiums written  an operating measure  is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period 
premiums earned is a gaap measure 
premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period 
the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our consolidated statements of financial position 
since the allstate brand policy periods are typically months for auto and months for homeowners  encompass auto and homeowners policy periods are typically months and deerbrook auto policy periods are typically months  rate changes will generally be recognized in premiums earned over a period of to months 
during this period  premiums written at a higher rate will cause an increase in the balance of unearned premiums on our consolidated statements of financial position

we define a catastrophe as an event that produces pretax losses before reinsurance in excess of million and involves multiple first party policyholders  or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset  per event threshold of average claims in a specific area  occurring within a certain amount of time following the event 
catastrophes are caused by various natural events including earthquakes  volcanoes  wildfires  tornadoes  hailstorms  hurricanes  tropical storms  high winds and winter storms 
we are also exposed to certain human made catastrophic events  such as certain acts of terrorism or industrial accidents 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted 
historical catastrophe experience since the beginning of  the average annual impact of catastrophes on our property liability loss ratio was points 
however  this average does not reflect the impact of some of the more significant actions we have taken to limit our catastrophe exposure 
consequently  we think it is useful to consider the impact of catastrophes after excluding losses that are now partially or substantially covered by the california earthquake authority cea  fhcf or placed with a third party  such as hurricane coverage in hawaii 
the average annual impact of all catastrophes  excluding losses from hurricanes andrew and iniki and losses from california earthquakes  on our property liability loss ratio was points since the beginning of comparatively  the average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio for the years through is shown in the following table 
average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio excluding losses from hurricanes andrew and iniki  and losses from california earthquakes hurricane exposure states all other total over time we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes 
limitations include our participation in various state facilities  such as the cea  which provides insurance for california earthquake losses  the fhcf  which provides reimbursements on certain qualifying florida hurricane losses  and other state facilities  such as wind pools 
however  the impact of these actions may be diminished by the growth in insured values  the effect of state insurance laws and regulations and by the effect of competitive considerations 
in addition  in various states we are required to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers 
because of our participation in these and other state facilities such as wind pools  we may be exposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities and or to assessments from these facilities 
actions we have taken or are considering to attain an acceptable catastrophe exposure level in our property business include removing wind coverage from certain policies and allowing our agencies to help customers apply for wind coverage through state facilities such as wind pools  changes in rates  deductibles and coverage  limitations on new business writings  changes to underwriting requirements  including limitations in coastal and adjacent counties  not offering continuing coverage to some existing policyholders  purchasing reinsurance or engaging in other forms of risk transfer arrangements  discontinuing coverage for certain types of residences  and or withdrawing from certain geographic markets 
in the normal course of business  we may supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters  appraisers  engineers  inspectors  other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims 
for example  our longstanding contract with pilot catastrophe services pilot for additional claims adjusters contributes to our ability to complete more timely settlement of catastrophe claims 
hurricanes we consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes to generally be major metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the united states 
generally  the average premium on a property policy near these coasts is greater than other areas 
we are addressing our risk of hurricane loss by  among other actions  purchasing additional reinsurance for specific states and on a countrywide basis for our personal lines property insurance  and in areas most exposed to hurricanes for further information on our reinsurance program see the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of the md a  limiting personal homeowners new business writings in coastal areas in southern and eastern states  not offering continuing coverage on certain policies in coastal counties in new york and certain other states  and entering into royal palm and royal palm our actions are expected to continue during in northeastern and certain other hurricane prone states 
in january of the state of florida enacted new property legislation which  among other actions  expands the capacity of the fhcf  prohibits excess profits for property insurers in the state  expands the time for non renewal notification  requires carriers writing certain types of auto coverages in the state to also write homeowners coverage unless that carrier is affiliated with a carrier that writes homeowners insurance in that state  and expands policyholder eligibility for citizens property insurance corporation fl citizens 
fl citizens was created by the state to provide insurance to property owners unable to obtain coverage in the private insurance market 
the comprehensive and extensive legislative changes essentially position fl citizens to be a direct competitor to the private insurance property market participants 
see note for a description of the ability of fl citizens to assess participating insurance companies for its financial deficit 
we are currently assessing the impact of this legislation on our catastrophe risk management strategy in the state of florida 
earthquakes actions taken related to our risk of earthquake loss include purchasing reinsurance on a countrywide basis and in the state of kentucky for our personal lines property insurance  no longer offering new optional earthquake coverage in most states  removing optional earthquake coverage on approximately  property policies at december  approximately  property policies at december  upon renewal in most states  and entering into arrangements to make earthquake coverage available through other insurers for new and renewal business 
these arrangements with third party insurers include many of the approximately  renewal property customers at december  in the states of alabama  alaska  arkansas  illinois  indiana  missouri  mississippi  ohio  oregon  south carolina  tennessee  utah and washington 
by the end of  we anticipate that we will have eliminated approximately of our optional earthquake coverages countrywide  based on our policies in force at december  allstate s premiums written attributable to optional earthquake coverage totaled approximately million in million in 
while this is a countrywide strategy  we will continue to have optional earthquake coverage available in certain states due to regulatory and other reasons 
we also will continue to have exposure to earthquake risk on certain policies and coverages that do not specifically exclude coverage for earthquake losses  including our auto policies  and to fires following earthquakes 
allstate policyholders in the state of california are offered coverage through the cea  a privately financed  publicly managed state agency created to provide insurance coverage for earthquake damage 
allstate is subject to assessments from the cea under certain circumstances 
fires following earthquakes actions taken related to our risk of loss from fires following earthquakes include changing homeowners underwriting requirements in california and purchasing additional reinsurance on a countrywide basis  in california and in kentucky 
allstate protection outlook allstate protection premiums written in will be slightly higher than levels 
we expect continued growth of allstate brand auto premiums written due to increased pif resulting from increases in the number of agencies representing us  advertising effectiveness and higher customer loyalty  being partially offset by the estimated effects of catastrophe management actions on homeowners and other property premiums  including the impacts of increased ceded premiums for catastrophe reinsurance totaling approximately million during we plan to introduce our new non standard auto product  allstate blue  in selective states during we anticipate that this new product will contribute favorably to the non standard premiums written trends 
we expect that volatility in the level of catastrophes we experience will contribute to variation in our underwriting results  however this volatility will be somewhat mitigated due to our catastrophe management actions including purchases of reinsurance 
we expect our auto and homeowners frequencies  excluding catastrophes  during to be comparable with results and auto and homeowners severity increases to be consistent with relevant indices 
we plan to continue to study the efficiencies of our operations and cost structure for additional areas where costs may be reduced 
any reductions in costs we achieve  however  may be offset by the costs of other new initiatives  such as increased expenditures for marketing and technology 
discontinued lines and coverages segment overview the discontinued lines and coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off 
our exposure to asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims is reported in this segment 
we have assigned management of this segment to a designated group of professionals with expertise in claims handling  policy coverage interpretation and exposure identification 
as part of its responsibilities  this group is also regularly engaged in policy buybacks  settlements and reinsurance assumed and ceded commutations 
summarized underwriting results for the years ended december  are presented in the following table 
in millions premiums written premiums earned claims and claims expense other costs and expenses underwriting loss underwriting loss of million in primarily related to an million reestimate of asbestos reserves 
also contributing to the underwriting loss was a million reestimate of environmental reserves and a million increase in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables 
the cost of administering claims settlements totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  the underwriting loss was primarily due to reestimates of asbestos reserves totaling million 
during  the underwriting loss was primarily due to reestimates of asbestos reserves totaling million  and an increase of million in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance 
see the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of the md a for a more detailed discussion 
discontinued lines and coverages outlook we may continue to experience asbestos losses in the future 
these losses could be due to the potential adverse impact of new information relating to new and additional claims or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as litigation or legislative  judicial and regulatory actions 
because of our annual ground up review  we believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available information  technology  laws and regulations 
we are somewhat encouraged that the pace of industry asbestos claim activity seems to be slowing  perhaps reflecting various recent state legislative and judicial actions with respect to medical criteria and increased legal scrutiny of the legitimacy of claims

property liability claims and claims expense reserves underwriting results of property liability are significantly influenced by estimates of property liability claims and claims expense reserves 
for a description of our reserve process  see note of the consolidated financial statements and for a further description of our reserving policies and the potential variability in our reserve estimates  see the application of critical accounting estimates section of the md a 
these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including ibnr claims  as of the reporting date 
the facts and circumstances leading to our reestimate of reserves relate to revisions to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid 
reestimates occur because actual losses are different than that predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates 
at december   the impact of a reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent increase or decrease in net reserves would be a decrease or increase of approximately million in net income

the following tables reflect the accident years to which the reestimates shown above are applicable for allstate brand  encompass brand and discontinued lines and coverages lines of business

this was primarily due to auto injury severity development and late reported loss development that was better than expected and including favorable reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses in and unfavorable in these trends are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors  as previously described  used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid 
because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates  reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends based on the indications of updated development factor calculations 
the impact of these reestimates on the allstate brand underwriting income loss is shown in the table below 
in millions reserve reestimates  allstate brand underwriting income loss   reserve reestimates as a of underwriting income loss encompass brand reserve reestimates in and were related to lower than anticipated claim settlement costs 
reserve reestimates in were related to higher than anticipated claim settlement costs 
the impact of these reestimates on the encompass brand underwriting income loss is shown in the table below 
in millions reserve reestimates encompass brand underwriting income loss reserve reestimates as a of underwriting income loss discontinued lines and coverages we conduct an annual review in the third quarter of each year to evaluate and establish asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines reserves 
reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined 
using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment  this detailed and comprehensive ground up methodology determines reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure eg claim activity  potential liability  jurisdiction  products versus non products exposure presented by individual policyholders 
reserve reestimates for the discontinued lines and coverages  as shown in the table below  were increased primarily for asbestos in and and for asbestos and other discontinued lines in in millions jan reserves reserve reestimate jan reserves reserve reestimate jan reserves reserve reestimate asbestos claims    environmental claims other discontinued lines total discontinued lines and coverages   underwriting loss income reserve reestimates as a of underwriting loss income reserve additions for asbestos in  and  totaling million  million and million  respectively  were primarily for products related coverage 
they were essentially a result of a continuing level of increased claim activity being reported by excess insurance policyholders with existing active claims  excess policyholders with new claims  and reestimates of liabilities for increased assumed reinsurance cessions  as ceding companies other insurance carriers also experienced increased claim activity 
increased claim activity over prior estimates has also resulted in an increased estimate for future claims reported 
these trends are consistent with the trends of other carriers in the industry  which we believe are related to increased publicity and awareness of coverage  ongoing litigation  potential congressional activity  and bankruptcy actions 
the table below summarizes reserves and claim activity for asbestos and environmental claims before gross and after net the effects of reinsurance for the past three years 
in millions  except ratios gross net gross net gross net asbestos claims beginning reserves      incurred claims and claims expense claims and claims expense paid ending reserves      annual survival ratio year survival ratio environmental claims beginning reserves incurred claims and claims expense claims and claims expense paid ending reserves annual survival ratio year survival ratio combined environmental and asbestos claims annual survival ratio year survival ratio percentage of ibnr in ending reserves the survival ratio is calculated by taking our ending reserves divided by payments made during the year 
this is a commonly used but extremely simplistic and imprecise approach to measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels 
many factors  such as mix of business  level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount of environmental and asbestos claims and claims expense reserves  claim payments and the resultant ratio 
as payments result in corresponding reserve reductions  survival ratios can be expected to vary over time 
in  the asbestos survival ratios improved due to a reduced level of claim payments 
in  the asbestos survival ratio declined due to an increase in claims paid  primarily due to commutations  policy buy backs  and settlement agreements that  in turn caused reduced reserve levels 
the total commutations  policy buy backs  and settlement agreements and the survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims for  and excluding these commutations  policy buy backs  and settlement agreements  are represented in the following table 
in millions  except ratios gross net gross net gross net asbestos claims commutations  policy buy backs settlement agreements annual survival ratio year survival ratio environmental claims commutations  policy buy backs settlement agreements annual survival ratio year survival ratio combined environmental and asbestos claims total commutations  policy buy backs settlement agreements annual survival ratio year survival ratio our three year net average survival ratio excluding commutations  policy buy backs  and settlement agreements is viewed to be another measure of current reserve adequacy 
it reflects a more normalized survival ratio by measuring the impact over three years and by excluding from payments amounts no longer carried in the reserves and not viewed in this ratio as a continuing payment level 
now at years for asbestos as of december   we consider it to represent a strong reserve position 
a one year increase in the three year average asbestos survival ratio at december  would require an after tax increase in reserves of approximately million 
our net asbestos reserves by type of exposure and total reserve additions are shown in the following table

reserve additions for asbestos for the year ended december   totaled million and included the following factors direct primary insurance net reserves decreased by million 
we were not a significant direct primary insurer and did not insure any of the large asbestos manufacturers on a direct primary insurance basis 
direct excess insurance net reserves increased by million as a result of revised estimates for two claims 
assumed reinsurance net reserves decreased by million due to lower claim activity 
the number of reported new claims is shown in the following table

ibnr net reserves decreased by million 
at december  ibnr represented of total asbestos reserves  points lower than at december  ibnr reserves are estimated to provide for probable future unfavorable reserve development of known claims and future reporting of additional unknown claims from current and new insurance policyholders and ceding companies 
our non products case reserves represent approximately of total asbestos case reserves 
we do not anticipate significant changes in this percentage as insureds retentions associated with excess insurance programs and assumed reinsurance exposure are seldom exceeded 
we did not write direct primary insurance on policyholders with the potential for significant non products related loss exposure 
for environmental exposures  a comprehensive ground up review  using processes similar to those used for the asbestos review  is also conducted in the third quarter of each year 
the analysis performed produced a million increase in and essentially no change in reserve estimates in or pending  new  total closed and closed without payment claims for asbestos and environmental exposures for the years ended december  are summarized in the following table 
number of claims asbestos pending  beginning of year    new    total closed   pending  end of year    closed without payment environmental pending  beginning of year    new  total closed   pending  end of year    closed without payment   property liability reinsurance ceded for allstate protection  we utilize reinsurance to reduce exposure to catastrophe risk and manage capital and to support the required statutory surplus and the insurance financial strength ratings of certain subsidiaries such as allstate floridian insurance company afic and allstate new jersey insurance company 
we purchase significant reinsurance where we believe the greatest benefit may be achieved relative to our aggregate countrywide exposure 
the price and terms of reinsurance and the credit quality of the reinsurer are considered in the purchase process  along with whether the price can be appropriately reflected in the costs that are considered in setting future rates charged to policyholders 
we also participate in various reinsurance mechanisms  including industry pools and facilities  which are backed by the financial resources of the property liability insurance company participants  and have historically purchased reinsurance to mitigate long tail liability lines  including environmental  asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures 
we retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers 
the impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for claims and claims expense at december are summarized in the following table  net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts 
reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense reinsurance recoverables  net in millions industry pools and facilities     asbestos and environmental    other including allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables   total property liability     reinsurance recoverables include an estimate of the amount of property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves that may be ceded under the terms of the reinsurance agreements  including incurred but not reported unpaid losses 
we calculate our ceded reinsurance estimate based on the terms of each applicable reinsurance agreement  including an estimate of how ibnr losses will ultimately be ceded under the agreement 
we also consider other limitations and coverage exclusions under our reinsurance agreements 
accordingly  our estimate of reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as our estimate of reserve for property liability claims and claims expense 
we believe the recoverables are appropriately established  however  as our underlying reserves continue to develop  the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded 
we regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts recoverable  and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed 
the establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates 
changes in estimates could result in additional changes to the consolidated statement of operations 
the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance relates to discontinued lines and coverages reinsurance recoverables and was million and million at december  and  respectively 
these amounts represent and  respectively of the related reinsurance recoverable balances 
the allowance is based upon our ongoing review of amounts outstanding  length of collection periods  changes in reinsurer credit standing  and other relevant factors 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business  we may become involved in coverage disputes with certain of our reinsurers which may ultimately result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against such reinsurers to determine the parties rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements 
we employ dedicated specialists to manage reinsurance collections and disputes 
we also consider recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants  and recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers in seeking to maximize our reinsurance recoveries 
adverse developments in the insurance industry have led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers  causing amounts recoverable from them and future claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk 
there has also been consolidation activity in the industry  which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies 
in addition  over the last several years the industry has increasingly segregated asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital 
regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions 
we are unable to determine the impact  if any  that these developments will have on the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables in the future

catastrophe reinsurance our personal lines catastrophe reinsurance program is designed  utilizing our risk management methodology  to address our exposure to catastrophes nationwide 
our program provides reinsurance protection to us for catastrophes including storms named or numbered by the national weather service  earthquakes and fires following earthquakes 
as discussed below  our reinsurance program is comprised of agreements that provide coverage for the occurrence of certain qualifying catastrophes in specific states including new york  new jersey  connecticut and texas multi year  other states along the southern and eastern coasts south east principally for hurricanes  in california for fires following earthquakes california fires following  in new jersey for losses in excess of the multi year agreement new jersey excess and in kentucky for earthquakes and fires following earthquakes kentucky 
another reinsurance agreement provides coverage nationwide  excluding florida  for the aggregate or sum of catastrophe losses in excess of an annual retention associated with storms named or numbered by the national weather service  earthquakes and fires following earthquakes aggregate excess 
during january  we completed the renewal of our aggregate excess  south east and new jersey excess reinsurance contracts  opted to expand coverage in the existing multi year contracts for new jersey and texas and added a new agreement covering kentucky earthquake and fires following earthquakes 
these contracts will be effective june  to may   with the exception of the aggregate excess contract which is effective june  to may  the aggregate excess contract has a retention by allstate in the first year and a retention by allstate in the second year 
we also expect to place contracts for the state of florida later this year  once the state s recent legislative actions have been assessed  and should become effective on june  for the beginning of the hurricane catastrophe season 
the florida component of the reinsurance program is designed separately from the other components of the program to address the distinct needs of our separately capitalized legal entities in that state 
the multi year agreements have various retentions and limits designed commensurate with the amount of catastrophe risk  measured on an annual basis  in each covered state 
a description of these retentions and limits appears in the following tables and charts 
the multi year  california fires following  new jersey excess  south east and kentucky agreements cover qualifying losses related to a specific qualifying event in excess of the agreement s retention 
reinsurance recoveries under each agreement are equal to the qualifying losses in excess of the agreement s retention for a specific event multiplied by the percentage of reinsurance placed up to the agreement s occurrence limit 
we estimate that the total annualized cost of all reinsurance programs will be approximately million per year or million per quarter  including an estimate for reinsurance coverage in florida 
this is compared to annualized cost of approximately million per year during the hurricane season  for an estimated decrease of million on an annualized basis due to lower expected cost of coverage in florida 
on a calendar year basis  we estimate a cost of million per quarter during  for a total of million  including an estimate for reinsurance coverage in florida 
this represents an estimated increase of million over the calendar year due to the effective dates of the contracts 
during  our actual costs were million in the first quarter  million in the second quarter  in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter of for a total of million during the year 
we currently expect that a similar level of coverage will be purchased or renewed for the comparable period 
the actual placement of the florida program  contractual redeterminations and risk transfers of certain catastrophe and other liability exposures during may cause our total annualized cost to differ from our current estimates 
we continue to aggressively seek to cover our reinsurance cost in premium rates 
through the end of  we have submitted more than rate filings in states related to the cost of our reinsurance programs 
including rates approved in florida and other states related to our reinsurance programs  rates currently effective reflect approximately of the total cost of our reinsurance programs  and will be included in premiums written during we expect rates will be in effect which will reflect over of the total cost of these reinsurance programs by the end of  and be included in premiums written during since the financial condition of the reinsurer is a critical deciding factor when entering into an agreement  the majority of the limits of these programs are placed with reinsurers who currently have an am best insurance financial strength rating of a or better 
the remaining limits are placed with reinsurers who currently have an am best insurance financial strength rating no lower than a  with three exceptions 
two of the three exceptions have a standard and poors rating of aa and we will have collateral for the entire contract limit exposure for the third reinsurer which is not rated by either rating agency 
because of these ratings  we do not expect that our ability to cede losses in the future will be impaired

contract charges are revenues generated from interest sensitive life  variable annuities  fixed annuities and institutional products for which deposits are classified as contractholder funds or separate accounts liabilities 
contract charges are assessed against the contractholder account values for maintenance  administration  cost of insurance and surrender prior to contractually specified dates 
as a result  changes in contractholder funds are considered in the evaluation of growth and as indicators of future levels of revenues 
subsequent to the close of our reinsurance transaction with prudential financial inc prudential on june   variable annuity contract charges on the business subject to the transaction are fully reinsured to prudential and presented net of reinsurance on the consolidated statements of operations see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes life and annuity premiums and contract charges by product 
in millions premiums traditional life immediate annuities with life contingencies accident and health and other total premiums  contract charges interest sensitive life fixed annuities variable annuities total contract charges    life and annuity premiums and contract charges   total premiums decreased in compared to excluding the impact of the transfer of the loan protection business to the allstate protection segment effective january   premiums increased in compared to this increase in was attributable primarily to increased premiums on immediate annuities with life contingencies  due to certain pricing refinements and a more favorable pricing environment in additionally  in  excluding the impact of the transfer of the loan protection business  accident and health and other premiums increased million due to increased sales of these products 
total premiums decreased in compared to as lower premiums on immediate annuities with life contingencies and traditional life products more than offset higher premiums on accident  health and other premiums 
premiums on immediate annuities with life contingencies declined primarily as a result of pricing actions taken to improve our returns on new business and reflect our current expectations of mortality 
pricing changes led to a shift in our sales mix from immediate annuities with life contingencies to immediate annuities without life contingencies  which are accounted for as deposits rather than as premiums 
the decline in traditional life premiums was primarily due to the absence of certain premiums in resulting from the disposal of our direct response distribution business in the increase in accident  health and other premiums was primarily attributable to higher underwriting retention 
contract charges declined in compared to excluding contract charges on variable annuities  substantially all of which are reinsured to prudential effective june   contract charges increased in compared to the increase was mostly due to higher contract charges on interest sensitive life products resulting from growth of business in force 
contract charges on fixed annuities were slightly higher in due to increased surrender charges 
contract charges increased in compared to the increase was due to higher contract charges on interest sensitive life  variable annuities and  to a lesser extent  fixed annuities 
the increase in the interest sensitive life contract charges was attributable to in force business growth resulting from deposits and credited interest more than offsetting surrenders and benefits 
higher variable annuity contract charges were primarily the result of higher account values and participation fees 
fixed annuity contract charges in reflect higher surrender charges compared with the prior year 
contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of individual and institutional products  such as interest sensitive life  fixed annuities  bank deposits and funding agreements 
the balance of contractholder funds is equal to the cumulative deposits received and interest credited to the contractholder less cumulative contract maturities  benefits  surrenders  withdrawals and contract charges for mortality or administrative expenses the following table shows the changes in contractholder funds

the increase in contractholder funds due to the adoption of statement of position no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts sop reflects the reclassification of certain products previously included as a component of separate accounts to contractholder funds  the reclassification of dsi from contractholder funds to other assets and the establishment of reserves for certain liabilities that are primarily related to income and other guarantees provided under fixed annuity  variable annuity and interest sensitive life contracts 
contractholder funds increased and in and  respectively 
average contractholder funds increased in compared to and in compared to the reduction in the rate at which contractholder funds grew was due primarily to lower contractholder deposits and increased contractholder surrenders and withdrawals 
contractholder deposits decreased in compared to due to decreased deposits on funding agreements and  to a lesser extent  lower variable annuity and life deposits allocated to fixed accounts due to the disposition of substantially all of our variable annuity business through reinsurance effective june  these items were partially offset by higher fixed annuity deposits 
allstate financial prioritizes the allocation of fixed income investments to support sales of retail products having the best opportunity for sustainable growth and return while maintaining a retail market presence 
consequently  sales of institutional products may vary from period to period 
in  deposits on institutional products declined compared to higher fixed annuity deposits in were the result of a million increase in deposits on allstate treasury linked annuity contracts 
this increase was partially offset by modest declines in deposits on traditional deferred annuities and market value adjusted annuities 
these declines were in part impacted by our actions to improve new business returns and reduced consumer demand 
consumer demand for fixed annuities is influenced by market interest rates on short term deposit products and equity market conditions  which can increase the relative attractiveness of competing investment alternatives 
contractholder deposits decreased in compared to due to lower deposits on fixed annuities 
fixed annuity deposits declined in as lower deposits on traditional deferred fixed annuities and market value adjusted annuities were partially offset by increased deposits on immediate annuities without life contingencies 
the decline in fixed annuity deposits resulted from reduced consumer demand relative to other short term deposit products due to increases in short term interest rates without corresponding increases in longer term rates  and pricing actions to increase fixed annuity product returns 
institutional product deposits decreased in compared to surrenders and partial withdrawals on deferred fixed annuities  interest sensitive life products and allstate bank products increased in compared to  while the withdrawal rate  based on the beginning of the period contractholder funds balance  increased to for from and  for and  respectively 
the increase in the surrender rate in was influenced by multiple factors  including the relatively low interest rate environment during the last several years  which reduced reinvestment opportunities and increased the number of policies with little or no surrender charge protection 
also influencing the increase was our crediting rate strategies related to renewal business implemented to improve investment spreads on selected contracts 
the increase in surrenders and partial withdrawals in is consistent with management s expectation that in the current interest rate environment and with a larger number of contractholders with relatively low or no surrender charges  more contractholders may choose to move their funds to competing investment alternatives 
the aging of our in force business may cause this trend to continue 
surrenders and partial withdrawals increased in compared to driven mostly by higher surrenders of market value adjusted annuities due to a portion of these contracts entering a day window in which there were no surrender charges or market value adjustments 
the lack of surrender charges and market value adjustments combined with the interest rate environment  which included a relatively small difference between short term and long term interest rates  caused contractholders to choose competing short term investment alternatives 
net investment income increased in compared to and in compared to the increase was due to increased investment yields and higher average portfolio balances 
the higher portfolio yields were primarily due to increased yields on floating rate instruments resulting from higher short term market interest rates and improved yields on assets supporting deferred fixed annuities 
in  the increase compared to was primarily the result of increased portfolio balances and  to a lesser extent  increased yields on floating rate assets due to higher short term interest rates and increased income on partnership interests  partially offset by lower yields on fixed income securities 
higher average portfolio balances in both years resulted from the investment of cash flows from operating and financing activities related primarily to deposits from fixed annuities  funding agreements and interest sensitive life policies 
investment balances as of december   increased from december  and increased as of december  compared to december  net income analysis is presented in the following table

for purposes of calculating gross margin  amortization of dsi is excluded from interest credited to contractholder funds and aggregated with amortization of dac due to the similarity in the substance of the two items 
amortization of dsi totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
amortization of dac and dsi relating to realized capital gains and losses is analyzed separately because realized capital gains and losses may vary significantly between periods and obscure trends in our business 
amortization of dac and dsi relating to realized capital gains and losses was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
gross margin  a non gaap measure  is comprised of life and annuity premiums and contract charges  and net investment income  less contract benefits and interest credited to contractholder funds excluding amortization of dsi 
gross margin also includes periodic settlements and accruals on certain non hedge derivative instruments see additional discussion under investment margin 
we use gross margin as a component of our evaluation of the profitability of allstate financial s life insurance and financial product portfolio 
additionally  for many of our products  including fixed annuities  variable life and annuities  and interest sensitive life insurance  the amortization of dac and dsi is determined based on actual and expected gross margin 
gross margin is comprised of three components that are utilized to further analyze the business investment margin  benefit margin  and contract charges and fees 
we believe gross margin and its components are useful to investors because they allow for the evaluation of income components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance 
gross margin  investment margin and benefit margin should not be considered as a substitute for net income and do not reflect the overall profitability of the business 
net income is the gaap measure that is most directly comparable to these margins 
gross margin is reconciled to allstate financial s gaap net income in the table above

gross margin increased in compared to due to increased investment and benefit margin  partially offset by lower contract charges and fees 
the decline in contract charges and fees was driven by the absence of contract charges on variable annuities that were reinsured effective june  in conjunction with allstate financial s disposition of substantially all of its variable annuity business

investment margin is a component of gross margin  both of which are non gaap measures 
investment margin represents the excess of net investment income and periodic settlements and accruals on certain non hedge derivative instruments over interest credited to contractholder funds and the implied interest on life contingent immediate annuities included in the reserve for life contingent contract benefits 
we utilize derivative instruments as economic hedges of investments or contractholder funds or to replicate fixed income securities 
these instruments either do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
such derivatives are accounted for at fair value  and reported in realized capital gains and losses 
periodic settlements and accruals on these derivative instruments are included as a component of gross margin  consistent with their intended use to enhance or maintain investment income and margin  and together with the economically hedged investments or product attributes eg  net investment income or interest credited to contractholders funds or replicated investments  to appropriately reflect trends in product performance 
amortization of dsi is excluded from interest credited to contractholder funds for purposes of calculating investment margin

benefit margin declined in compared to our life insurance and annuity business contributed equally to the decline in the decline in our annuity benefit margin was primarily driven by unfavorable mortality experience on immediate annuities with life contingencies and an increase in variable annuity contract benefits 
the decline in our life insurance benefit margin was primarily due to the absence of margin on certain products resulting from the disposal of our direct response distribution business in the prior year and modestly unfavorable mortality experience on our traditional life business  partially offset by growth in our life insurance in force 
amortization of dac and dsi  excluding amortization related to realized capital gains and losses  increased in compared to primarily due to improved gross profits on investment contracts resulting from increased investment and benefit margin  and lower expenses 
additionally  dac and dsi amortization for includes a write off totaling million for the present value of future profits related to a block of corporate owned life insurance policies that terminated due to the bankruptcy of the policyholder 
partially offsetting these increases was the significant reduction in amortization on the variable annuity contracts due to the disposition of this business effective june  through reinsurance

no amounts have been deemed unrecoverable in the three years ended december  we enter into certain inter company reinsurance transactions for the allstate financial operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities 
these reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities 
all significant inter company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
allstate financial outlook we plan to continue to balance targeted improvements in return on equity with growth in sales and profitability 
initially  our actions to improve returns may reduce the price competitiveness of certain products  such as our fixed annuities  and slow or reduce the growth in sales and income 
we expect that the near term improvements in our returns will be generated mostly by improved capital efficiency and will later be accompanied by improved profitability 
we plan to continue to maintain discipline over expenses and improve our operating efficiency 
we plan to increase sales of our financial products by allstate exclusive agencies by further tailoring products for our customers and making it easier for our agents to distribute allstate financial products 
we expect to continue to prioritize the allocation of fixed income investments to support sales of products with the best sustainable growth and margins and to maintain a market presence for fixed annuity and life products in our retail distribution channels 
sales of our institutional products may vary as a result 
we plan to develop and bring to market new innovative life insurance products or features designed to increase sales of this product line 
investments an important component of our financial results is the return on our investment portfolios 
investment portfolios are segmented between the property liability  allstate financial and corporate and other operations 
the investment portfolios are managed based upon the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability structure 
overview and strategy the property liability portfolio s investment strategy emphasizes safety of principal and consistent income generation  within a total return framework 
this approach  which has produced competitive returns over time  is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims  while maximizing economic value and surplus growth 
we employ a strategic asset allocation model  which takes into account the nature of the liabilities and risk tolerances  as well as the risk return parameters of the various asset classes in which we invest 
the model s recommended asset allocation  along with duration and liquidity considerations  guides our initial asset allocation 
this is further adjusted based on our analysis of other potential market opportunities available 
portfolio performance is measured against outside benchmarks at target allocation weights 
the allstate financial portfolio s investment strategy focuses on the need for risk adjusted spread on the underlying liabilities while maximizing return on capital 
we believe investment spread is maximized by selecting assets that perform favorably on a long term basis and by disposing of certain assets to minimize the effect of downgrades and defaults 
we believe this strategy maintains the investment margin necessary to sustain income over time 
the portfolio management approach employs a combination of recognized market  analytical and proprietary modeling  including a strategic asset allocation model  as the primary basis for the allocation of interest sensitive  illiquid and credit assets as well as for determining overall below investment grade exposure and diversification requirements 
within the ranges set by the strategic asset allocation model  tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions 
the corporate and other portfolio s investment strategy balances the pursuit of competitive returns with the unique liquidity needs of the portfolio relative to the overall corporate capital structure 
the portfolio is primarily invested in high quality  highly liquid fixed income and short term securities with additional investments in less liquid holdings in order to enhance overall returns 
as a result of tactical decisions in each of the portfolios  we may sell securities during the period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities 
portfolio monitoring  which includes identifying securities that are other than temporarily impaired and recognizing impairment on securities in an unrealized loss position for which we do not have the intent and ability to hold until recovery  are conducted regularly

total investments at amortized cost related to collateral received in connection with securities lending business activities  funds received in connection with securities repurchase agreements  and collateral posted by counterparties related to derivative transactions  increased to billion at december   from billion at december  we use different methodologies to estimate the fair value of publicly and non publicly traded marketable investment securities and exchange traded and non exchange traded derivative contracts 
for a discussion of these methods  see the application of critical accounting estimates section of the md a

the municipal bond portfolio at december  consisted of approximately  issues from approximately  issuers 
the largest exposure to a single issuer was approximately of the municipal bond portfolio 
corporate entities were the ultimate obligors of approximately of the municipal bond portfolio 
corporate bonds totaled billion and were rated investment grade at december  as of december   the portfolio contained billion of privately placed corporate obligations or  compared with billion or at december  included within privately placed corporate obligations are bank loans  which are primarily senior secured corporate loans  and other non publicly traded corporate obligations 
approximately billion or of the privately placed corporate obligations consisted of fixed rate privately placed securities 
the primary benefits of fixed rate privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities may include generally higher yields  improved cash flow predictability through pro rata sinking funds  and a combination of covenant and call protection features designed to better protect the holder against losses resulting from credit deterioration  reinvestment risk or fluctuations in interest rates 
a disadvantage of fixed rate privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities is relatively reduced liquidity 
at december   of the privately placed securities were rated investment grade 
foreign government securities totaled billion and were rated investment grade at december  mortgage backed securities mbs totaled billion and were rated investment grade at december  the credit risk associated with mbs is mitigated due to the fact that of the portfolio consists of securities that were issued by  or have underlying collateral that is guaranteed by us government agencies or us government sponsored entities 
the mbs portfolio is subject to interest rate risk since price volatility and the ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of prepayment of the underlying mortgages 
commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs totaled billion and were rated investment grade at december  cmbs investments primarily represent pools of commercial mortgages  broadly diversified across property types and geographical area 
the cmbs portfolio is subject to credit risk  but unlike other structured products  is generally not subject to prepayment risk due to protections within the underlying commercial mortgages  whereby borrowers are effectively restricted from prepaying their mortgages due to changes in interest rates 
credit defaults can result in credit directed prepayments 
approximately of the cmbs portfolio had a moody s rating of aaa or a standard poor s or fitch rating of aaa  the highest rating categories  at december  asset backed securities abs totaled billion and were rated investment grade at december  our abs portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk 
credit risk is managed by monitoring the performance of the collateral 
in addition  many of the securities in the abs portfolio are credit enhanced with features such as over collateralization  subordinated structures  reserve funds  guarantees and or insurance 
approximately of the abs portfolio had a moody s rating of aaa or a standard poor s or fitch rating of aaa  the highest rating categories 
a portion of the abs portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk since  for example  price volatility and ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of prepayment of the underlying assets 
as of december   of the portfolio was less sensitive to interest rate risk due to the payment terms or underlying collateral of the securities 
the abs portfolio includes bonds that are secured by a variety of asset types  predominately home equity loans  credit card receivables and auto loans as well as collateralized debt obligations that are predominately secured by corporate bonds and loans 
we may utilize derivative financial instruments to help manage the exposure to interest rate risk from the fixed income securities portfolio 
for a more detailed discussion of interest rate risk and our use of derivative financial instruments  see the market risk section of the md a and note of the consolidated financial statements 
at december   of the consolidated fixed income securities portfolio was rated investment grade  which is defined as a security having a rating from the national association of insurance commissioners naic of or  a rating of aaa  aa  a or baa from moody s or a rating of aaa  aa  a or bbb from standard poor s  fitch or dominion or a rating of aaa  aa  a or bbb from am best  or a comparable internal rating if an externally provided rating is not available

as of december   million or of the gross unrealized losses in the corporate fixed income portfolio and million or of the gross unrealized losses in the remaining fixed income securities were rated investment grade 
unrealized losses on investment grade securities are principally related to rising interest rates or changes in credit spreads since the securities were acquired 
all securities in an unrealized loss position at december  were included in our portfolio monitoring process for determining which declines in value were not other than temporary 
the following table shows the composition by credit quality of the fixed income securities with gross unrealized losses at december  in millions naic rating moody s equivalent unrealized loss percent to total fair value percent to total aaa aa a  baa  ba b caa or lower in or near default total  the table above includes securities that have not yet received an naic rating  for which we have assigned a comparable internal rating  with a fair value totaling million and an unrealized loss of million 
due to lags between the funding of an investment  execution of final legal documents  filing with the securities valuation office svo of the naic  and rating by the svo  we will always have a small number of securities that have a pending rating 
at december   million  or  of the gross unrealized losses were related to investment grade fixed income securities 
unrealized losses on investment grade securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in sector related credit spreads since the securities were acquired 
as of december   million of the gross unrealized losses were related to below investment grade fixed income securities 
of this amount  there were no significant unrealized loss positions greater than or equal to of amortized cost for six or more consecutive months prior to december  included among the securities rated below investment grade are both public and privately placed high yield bonds and securities that were investment grade when originally acquired 
we mitigate the credit risk of investing in below investment grade fixed income securities by limiting the percentage of our fixed income portfolio invested in such securities  through diversification of the portfolio  and active credit monitoring and portfolio management 
the scheduled maturity dates for fixed income securities in an unrealized loss position at december  are shown below 
actual maturities may differ from those scheduled as a result of prepayments by the issuers

the equity portfolio is comprised of securities in the following sectors 
gross unrealized in millions at december  fair value cost gains losses consumer goods cyclical and non cyclical  technology financial services real estate capital goods banking communications energy basic industry utilities transportation other   total equities    other consists primarily of limited partnership investments and index based securities 
at december   the consumer goods  technology and energy sectors had the highest concentration of gross unrealized losses in our equity portfolio  which were company and sector specific 
we expect eventual recovery of these securities and the related sectors 
all securities in an unrealized loss position at december  were included in our portfolio monitoring process for determining which declines in value were not other than temporary 
portfolio monitoring we have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate  on a case by case basis  fixed income and equity securities whose carrying value may be other than temporarily impaired 
the process includes a quarterly review of all securities using a screening process to identify those securities whose fair value compared to amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities is below established thresholds for certain time periods  or which are identified through other monitoring criteria such as ratings downgrades or payment defaults 
the securities identified  in addition to other securities for which we may have a concern  are evaluated based on facts and circumstances for inclusion on our watch list 
as a result of approved programs involving the disposition of investments such as changes in duration and revisions to strategic asset allocations and liquidity actions  and certain dispositions anticipated by portfolio managers  we also conduct a portfolio review to recognize impairment on securities in an unrealized loss position for which we do not have the intent and ability to hold until recovery 
all securities in an unrealized loss position at december  were included in our portfolio monitoring process for determining which declines in value were not other than temporary 
the following table summarizes fixed income and equity securities in a gross unrealized loss position according to significance  aging and investment grade classification

the largest individual unrealized loss was million for category i and million for category ii as of december  categories i and ii have generally been adversely affected by overall economic conditions including interest rate increases and the market s evaluation of certain sectors 
the degree to which and or length of time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position does not suggest that these securities pose a high risk of being other than temporarily impaired 
categories iii and iv have primarily been adversely affected by industry and issue specific conditions 
all of the securities in these categories are monitored for impairment 
we expect that the fair values of these securities will recover over time 
whenever our initial analysis indicates that a fixed income security s unrealized loss of or more for at least months or any equity security s unrealized loss of or more for at least months is temporary  additional evaluations and management approvals are required to substantiate that a write down is not appropriate 
as of december   no securities met these criteria

we monitor the quality of our fixed income portfolio by categorizing certain investments as problem  restructured or potential problem 
problem fixed income securities are securities in default with respect to principal or interest and or securities issued by companies that have gone into bankruptcy subsequent to our acquisition of the security 
restructured fixed income securities have rates and terms that are not consistent with market rates or terms prevailing at the time of the restructuring 
potential problem fixed income securities are current with respect to contractual principal and or interest  but because of other facts and circumstances  we have concerns regarding the borrower s ability to pay future principal and interest  which causes us to believe these securities may be classified as problem or restructured in the future 
the following table summarizes problem  restructured and potential problem fixed income securities at december in millions amortized cost fair value percent of total fixed income portfolio amortized cost fair value percent of total fixed income portfolio problem restructured potential problem total net carrying value cumulative write downs recognized cumulative write downs recognized only reflects write downs related to securities within the problem  potential problem and restructured categories 
we have experienced a decrease in the amortized cost of fixed income securities categorized as problem and potential problem as of december  compared to december  the decrease was primarily due to dispositions and the removal of securities upon improving conditions 
we evaluated each of these securities through our portfolio monitoring process at december  and recorded write downs when appropriate 
we further concluded that any remaining unrealized losses on these securities were temporary in nature and that we have the intent and ability to hold the securities until recovery 
while these balances may increase in the future  particularly if economic conditions are unfavorable  management expects that the total amount of securities in these categories will remain low relative to the total fixed income securities portfolio 
net realized capital gains and losses the following table presents the components of realized capital gains and losses and the related tax effect for the years ended december in millions investment write downs dispositions valuation of derivative instruments settlement of derivative instruments realized capital gains and losses  pretax income tax expense realized capital gains and losses  after tax dispositions in the above table include sales  losses recognized in anticipation of dispositions and other transactions such as calls and prepayments 
we may sell impaired fixed income  cost or equity securities that were in an unrealized loss position at the previous reporting date in situations where new factors such as negative developments  subsequent credit deterioration  changing liquidity needs  and newly identified market opportunities cause a change in our previous intent to hold a security to recovery or maturity 
the loss for the year ended december  on the settlement of derivative instruments was primarily driven by million of realized losses from commodity based excess return swaps and futures contracts 
for portfolio diversification  we enter into commodity based investments through the use of excess return swaps and futures contracts whose returns are tied to a commodity based index which declined in value 
a changing interest rate environment will drive changes in our portfolio duration targets at a tactical level 
a duration target and range is established with an economic view of liabilities relative to a long term portfolio view 
tactical duration adjustments within management s approved ranges are accomplished through both cash market transactions and derivative activities that generate realized gains and losses and through new purchases 
as a component of our approach to managing portfolio duration  realized gains and losses on derivative instruments are most appropriately considered in conjunction with the unrealized gains and losses on the fixed income portfolio 
this approach mitigates the impacts of general interest rate changes to the overall financial condition of the corporation 
dispositions included net realized gains on sales and other transactions such as calls and prepayments of million and losses recorded in connection with anticipated dispositions of million 
the net realized gains on sales and other transactions were comprised of gross gains of million and gross losses of million 
the million in gross losses primarily consisted of million from sales of fixed income securities and million from sales of equity securities 
during our comprehensive portfolio reviews  we ascertain whether there are any approved programs involving the disposition of investments such as changes in duration  revision to strategic asset allocation and liquidity actions  and any dispositions anticipated by the portfolio managers resulting from their on going comprehensive reviews of the portfolios 
upon approval of such programs  we identify a population of suitable investments  typically larger than needed to execute the disposition  from which specific securities are selected to sell 
due to our change in intent to hold until recovery  we recognize impairments  which are included in losses from dispositions  on any of these securities in an unrealized loss position 
when the objectives of the programs are accomplished  any remaining securities are redesignated as intent to hold until recovery 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of losses related to a change in our intent to hold certain securities with unrealized losses until they recover in value 
the change in our intent was driven by certain approved programs  including funding for the disposition through reinsurance of substantially all of allstate financial s variable annuity business  yield enhancement strategies for allstate financial  a liquidity strategy review for corporate and other segment  and changes to strategic asset allocations for allstate protection 
these programs were completed during additionally  ongoing comprehensive reviews of both the allstate protection and allstate financial portfolios resulted in the identification of anticipated dispositions by the portfolio managers 
at december   the fair value of securities for which we did not have the intent to hold until recovery totaled million 
at december   the fair value of the securities for which we did not have the intent to hold until recovery totaled billion 
approved programs involving the disposition of securities included liquidity needs to pay catastrophe claims  revisions to strategic asset allocations for allstate protection  and dispositions anticipated by the portfolio managers resulting from their on going comprehensive reviews of the portfolios on which we recognized million of losses during these objectives were accomplished during the ten largest losses from sales of individual securities for the year ended december  totaled million with the largest loss being million and the smallest loss being million 
one of the securities comprising the million was in an unrealized loss position greater than or equal to of amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities for a period of less than six consecutive months 
our largest aggregate loss on dispositions and writedowns are shown in the following table by issuer and its affiliates 
no other issuer together with its affiliates had an aggregated loss on dispositions and writedowns greater than of the total gross loss on dispositions and writedowns on fixed income and equity securities 
in millions fair value at disposition proceeds loss on dispositions write downs december  holdings net unrealized gain loss limited partnership investment fund household product retailer aircraft securitized trust automobile manufacturer gaming lodging company pharmaceutical company healthcare provider total dispositions include losses recognized in anticipation of dispositions 
holdings include fixed income securities at amortized cost or equity securities at cost 
the circumstances of the above losses are considered to be company specific and are not expected to have an effect on other holdings in our portfolios 
mortgage loans our mortgage loan portfolio which is primarily held in the allstate financial portfolio was billion at december  and billion at december   and comprised primarily of loans secured by first mortgages on developed commercial real estate 
geographical and property type diversification are key considerations used to manage our mortgage loan risk 
we closely monitor our commercial mortgage loan portfolio on a loan by loan basis 
loans with an estimated collateral value less than the loan balance  as well as loans with other characteristics indicative of higher than normal credit risk  are reviewed by financial and investment management at least quarterly for purposes of establishing valuation allowances and placing loans on non accrual status 
the underlying collateral values are based upon either discounted property cash flow projections or a commonly used valuation method that utilizes a one year projection of expected annual income divided by an expected rate of return 
we had no net realized capital losses related to write downs on mortgage loans for the years ended december  and and had million for the year ended december  short term investments our short term investment portfolio was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
we invest available cash balances primarily in taxable short term securities having a final maturity date or redemption date of less than one year 
as one of our business activities  we conduct securities lending  primarily as an investment yield enhancement  with third parties such as brokerage firms 
we obtain collateral in an amount generally equal to and of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities  respectively  and monitor the market value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary 
the cash we receive is invested in short term and fixed income investments  and an offsetting liability is recorded in other liabilities and accrued expense 
at december   the amount of securities lending collateral reinvested in short term investments had a carrying value of million 
this compares to million at december  market risk market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity  interest  commodity  or currency exchange rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices  although we also have a smaller exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
the active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations 
we may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges rebalancing existing asset or liability portfolios  changing the character of investments purchased in the future and using derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased 
for a more detailed discussion of our use of derivative financial instruments  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
overview we generate substantial investible funds from our property liability and allstate financial businesses 
in formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds  we seek to earn returns that enhance our ability to offer competitive rates and prices to customers while contributing to attractive and stable profits and long term capital growth 
accordingly  our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each business 
investment policies define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks  including accountability and control over risk management activities 
subsidiaries that conduct investment activities follow policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors 
these investment policies specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given the liquidity  surplus  product profile and regulatory requirements of the subsidiary 
executive oversight and investment activities are conducted primarily through subsidiaries boards of directors and investment committees 
for allstate financial  its asset liability management alm policies further define the overall framework for managing market and investment risks 
alm focuses on strategies to enhance yields  mitigate market risks and optimize capital to improve profitability and returns for allstate financial 
allstate financial alm activities follow asset liability policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors 
these alm policies specify limits  ranges and or targets for investments that best meet allstate financial s business objectives in light of its product liabilities 
we manage our exposure to market risk through the use of asset allocation  duration and value at risk limits  through the use of simulation and  as appropriate  through the use of stress tests 
we have asset allocation limits that place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class 
we have duration limits on the property liability and allstate financial investment portfolios and  as appropriate  on individual components of these portfolios 
these duration limits place restrictions on the amount of interest rate risk that may be taken 
our value at risk limits are intended to restrict the potential loss in fair value that could arise from adverse movements in the fixed income  equity  and currency markets based on historical volatilities and correlations among market risk factors 
comprehensive day to day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies 
for allstate financial  this day to day management is integrated with and informed by the activities of the alm organization 
this integration results in a prudent  methodical and effective adjudication of market risk and return  conditioned by the unique demands and dynamics of allstate financial s product liabilities and supported by the application of advanced risk technology and analytics 
although we apply a similar overall philosophy to market risk  the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments differ considerably between the property liability and allstate financial businesses affecting investment decisions and risk parameters 
interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates 
this risk arises from many of our primary activities  as we invest substantial funds in interest rate sensitive assets and issue interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we manage the interest rate risk in our assets relative to the interest rate risk in our liabilities 
one of the measures used to quantify this exposure is duration 
duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates 
for example  if interest rates increase basis points  the fair value of an asset exhibiting a duration of is expected to decrease in value by approximately 
at december   the difference between our asset and liability duration was approximately  compared to a gap at december  a positive duration gap indicates that the fair value of our assets is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our liabilities 
most of our duration gap originates from the property liability operations  with the primary liabilities being auto and homeowners claims 
in the management of investments supporting the property liability business  we adhere to an objective of emphasizing safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return framework 
this approach is designed to ensure our financial strength and stability for paying claims  while maximizing economic value and surplus growth 
this objective generally results in a positive duration mismatch between the property liability assets and liabilities 
for the allstate financial business  we seek to invest premiums  contract charges and deposits to generate future cash flows that will fund future claims  benefits and expenses  and that will earn stable margins across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios 
in order to achieve this objective and limit interest rate risk for allstate financial  we adhere to a philosophy of managing the duration of assets and related liabilities 
this philosophy may include using interest rate swaps  futures  forwards  caps  floors and swaptions to reduce the interest rate risk resulting from mismatches between existing assets and liabilities  and financial futures and other derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk of anticipated purchases and sales of investments and product sales to customers 
we pledge and receive collateral on certain types of derivative contracts 
for futures and option contracts traded on exchanges  we have pledged securities as margin deposits totaling million as of december  for over the counter derivative transactions including interest rate swaps  foreign currency swaps  interest rate caps  interest rate floor agreements  and credit default swaps  master netting agreements are used 
these agreements allow us to net payments due for transactions covered by the agreements  and when applicable  we are required to post collateral 
as of december   we held million of cash pledged by counterparties as collateral for over the counter instruments and pledged million in securities as collateral to counterparties 
to calculate the duration gap between assets and liabilities  we project asset and liability cash flows and calculate their net present value using a risk free market interest rate adjusted for credit quality  sector attributes  liquidity and other specific risks 
duration is calculated by revaluing these cash flows at alternative interest rates and determining the percentage change in aggregate fair value 
the cash flows used in this calculation include the expected maturity and repricing characteristics of our derivative financial instruments  all other financial instruments as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  and certain other items including unearned premiums  property liability claims and claims expense reserves  interest sensitive liabilities and annuity liabilities 
the projections include assumptions based upon historical market experience and our experience that reflect the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment  lapse  leverage and or option features of instruments  where applicable 
such assumptions relate primarily to mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  municipal housing bonds  callable municipal and corporate obligations  and fixed rate single and flexible premium deferred annuities 
additionally  the calculations include assumptions regarding the renewal of property liability policies 
based upon the information and assumptions we use in this duration calculation  and interest rates in effect at december   we estimate that a basis point immediate  parallel increase in interest rates rate shock would decrease the net fair value of the assets and liabilities by approximately billion  compared to billion at december  reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of a program that uses short futures to manage the property liability interest rate risk exposures relative to duration targets 
based on contracts in place at december   we would recognize realized capital gains totaling million in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel interest rate increase and million in realized capital losses in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel interest rate decrease 
the selection of a basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
there are billion of assets supporting life insurance products such as traditional and interest sensitive life that are not financial instruments 
these assets and the associated liabilities have not been included in the above estimate 
the billion of assets excluded from the calculation has increased from the billion reported at december  due to an increase in the in force account value of interest sensitive life products 
based on assumptions described above  in the event of a basis point immediate increase in interest rates  the assets supporting life insurance products would decrease in value by million  compared to a decrease of million at december  to the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions we used in these calculations  duration and rate shock measures could be significantly impacted 
additionally  our calculations assume that the current relationship between short term and long term interest rates the term structure of interest rates will remain constant over time 
as a result  these calculations may not fully capture the effect of non parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and or large changes in interest rates 
equity price risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in the general levels of the equity markets 
at december   we held approximately billion in common stocks and billion in other securities with equity risk including primarily convertible securities  limited partnership funds  non redeemable preferred securities and equity linked notes  compared to approximately billion in common stocks and billion in other equity investments at december  approximately and of these totals  respectively  represented assets of the property liability operations at december   compared to approximately and  respectively  at december  additionally  we had million in short standard poor s composite price index s p futures at december  with a fair value of million 
at december   our portfolio of common stocks and other securities with equity risk had a beta of approximately  compared to a beta of approximately at december  beta represents a widely used methodology to describe  quantitatively  an investment s market risk characteristics relative to an index such as the s p based on the beta analysis  we estimate that if the s p decreases by  the fair value of our equity investments will decrease by approximately 
likewise  we estimate that if the s p increases by  the fair value of our equity investments will increase by approximately 
based upon the information and assumptions we used to calculate beta at december   we estimate that an immediate decrease in the s p of would decrease the net fair value of our equity investments identified above by approximately million  compared to million at december  reflected in the equity calculation are the effects of a program that uses short futures to manage property liability equity risk exposures relative to equity targets 
based on contracts in place at december   we would recognize realized capital gains totaling million in the event of a immediate decrease in the s p and capital losses totaling million in the event of a immediate increase in the s p the selection of a immediate decrease in the s p should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
the beta of our common stocks and other securities with equity risk was determined by comparing the monthly total returns of these investments to monthly total returns of the s p over a three year historical period 
since beta is historically based  projecting future price volatility using this method involves an inherent assumption that historical volatility and correlation relationships between stocks and the composition of our portfolio will not change in the future 
therefore  the illustrations noted above may not reflect our actual experience if future volatility and correlation relationships differ from the historical relationships 
at december  and  we had separate accounts assets related to variable annuity and variable life contracts with account values totaling billion and billion  respectively 
equity risk exists for contract charges based on separate account balances and guarantees for death and or income benefits provided by our variable products 
in  we disposed of substantially all of the variable annuity business through a reinsurance agreement with prudential as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  and therefore mitigated this aspect of our risk 
equity risk for our variable life business relates to contract charges and policyholder benefits 
total variable life contract charges for and were million and million  respectively 
separate account liabilities related to variable life contracts were million and million in december  and  respectively 
at december  and we had approximately billion and billion  respectively  in equity indexed annuity liabilities that provide customers with interest crediting rates based on the performance of the s p we hedge the risk associated with these liabilities through the purchase and sale of equity indexed options and futures  interest rate swaps  and eurodollar futures  maintaining risk within specified value at risk limits 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments  including real estate funds and our canadian operations 
we also have funding agreement programs and a small amount of fixed income securities that are denominated in foreign currencies  but we use derivatives to effectively hedge the foreign currency risk of these funding agreements and securities 
at december  and  we had approximately billion and billion  respectively  in funding agreements denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   we had approximately million in foreign currency denominated equity securities and an additional million net investment in our foreign subsidiaries 
these amounts were million and million  respectively  at december  the foreign currency exposure is almost entirely in the property liability business 
based upon the information and assumptions we used at december   we estimate that a immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would decrease the value of our foreign currency denominated instruments by approximately million  compared with an estimated million decrease at december  the selection of a immediate decrease in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
our currency exposure is diversified across currencies  compared to currencies at december  our largest individual currency exchange exposures at december  were to the canadian dollar and the euro 
the largest individual currency exchange exposures at december  were to the canadian dollar and the euro 
our primary regional exposure is to western europe  approximately at december   compared to at december  the modeling technique we use to report our currency exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates 
even though we believe it is very unlikely that all of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would simultaneously decrease by  we nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and other hypothetical extreme adverse market scenarios 
our actual experience may differ from these results because of assumptions we have used or because significant liquidity and market events could occur that we did not foresee 
commodity price risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the prices of commodities 
this risk arises from our commodity linked investments  such as the goldman sachs commodity index a broad based  oil dominated index 
at december  and  we had approximately million and million exposure to the index  respectively 
this exposure is almost entirely within property liability 
based upon the information and assumptions available at december   we estimate that a immediate unfavorable change to the commodity index would decrease the value of our commodity investments by million  compared with an estimated million decrease at december  the selection of a immediate decrease in commodity prices should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
pension plans we have defined benefit pension plans  which cover most full time and certain part time employees and employee agents 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
for further information on sfas no 
 see note of the consolidated financial statements 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements 
also during  the federal government enacted the pension protection act of the act which changes the manner in which pension funding is determined 
the new rules are effective for funding beginning in we are currently reviewing the implications of the act  but do not expect it to have a material impact on funding 
our obligations have not changed as a result of these developments 
the pension and other postretirement plans may be amended or terminated at any time 
any revisions could result in significant changes to our obligations and our obligation to fund the plans 
as provided for in sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions  the market related value component of expected returns recognizes plan equity losses and gains over a five year period  which we believe is consistent with the long term nature of pension obligations 
as a result  the effect of changes in fair value on our net periodic pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur 
net periodic pension cost in is estimated to be million based on current assumptions 
net periodic pension cost increased in and principally due to decreases in the weighted average discount rate assumption which is based on long term interest rates  the impact of unfavorable investment returns from prior periods on the market related value of assets  and the amortization of actuarial losses 
in each of the years  and  net pension cost included non cash settlement charges primarily resulting from lump sum distributions made to agents and in due to higher lump sum payments made to allstate employees 
settlement charges are expected to continue in the future as we settle our remaining agent pension obligations by making lump sum distributions to agents 
amounts recorded for pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income are significantly affected by fluctuations in the returns on plan assets and the amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses 
plan assets sustained net losses in prior periods primarily due to declines in equity markets 
these asset losses  combined with all other unrecognized actuarial gains and losses  resulted in amortization of net actuarial loss and additional net periodic pension cost of million in and million in we anticipate that the unrealized loss for our pension plans will exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets during the foreseeable future  resulting in additional amortization and net periodic pension cost 
in conjunction with the recognition of the net actuarial loss in accumulated other comprehensive income  upon adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded a deferred tax asset of million 
the deferred tax asset will be amortized in conjunction with the net actuarial losses over the remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on the assumption that certain levels of income will be achieved 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further information on deferred tax assets 
amounts recorded for net periodic pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income are also significantly affected by changes in the assumptions used to determine the weighted average discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the weighted average discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date 
we develop the assumed weighted average discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from bonds available in the lehman corporate bond universe having ratings of at least aa by standard poor s or at least aa by moody s on the measurement date with cash flows that match expected plan benefit requirements 
significant changes in discount rates  such as those caused by changes in the yield curve  the mix of bonds available in the market  the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments  may result in volatility in pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income 
holding other assumptions constant  a hypothetical decrease of basis points in the weighted average discount rate would result in an increase of million in net periodic pension cost and a million increase in the underfunded liability of our pension plans recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income after tax as of october   our most recent measurement date  versus an increase of million in net periodic pension cost and a billion increase in the minimum pension liability after tax as of october  a hypothetical increase of basis points in the weighted average discount rate would decrease net periodic pension cost by million and would decrease the underfunded liability of our pension plans recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income after tax by million as of october   versus a decrease in net periodic pension cost of million and a million decrease in the minimum pension liability after tax as of october  this non symmetrical range results from the non linear relationship between discount rates and pension obligations  and changes in the amortization of unrealized net actuarial gains and losses 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets 
while this rate reflects long term assumptions and is consistent with long term historical returns  sustained changes in the market or changes in the mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets that may result in variability of pension cost 
differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are a component of unrecognized gains or losses  which may be amortized as a component of net actuarial gains and losses and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
as a result  the effect of changes in fair value on our pension cost may be experienced in results of operation in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur 
holding other assumptions constant  a hypothetical decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase of million in pension cost at october   compared to an increase in pension cost of million at october  a hypothetical increase of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease in net periodic pension cost of million at october   compared to a decrease in pension cost of million at october  capital resources and liquidity capital resources consist of shareholders equity and debt  representing funds deployed or available to be deployed to support business operations or for general corporate purposes 
the following table summarizes our capital resources at december in millions common stock  retained earnings and other shareholders equity items accumulated other comprehensive income   total shareholders equity    debt    total capital resources    ratio of debt to shareholders equity ratio of debt to capital resources shareholders equity increased in  due to net income which was partly offset by share repurchases  dividends paid to shareholders  decreases in unrealized net capital gains on investments  and the recognition of the net funded status of pension and other post retirement benefit obligations recognized with the adoption of sfas no 
shareholders equity declined in when compared to  due to net income being offset by share repurchases  decreases in unrealized net capital gains on investments and dividends paid to shareholders 
sfas no 
requires that all previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service cost be recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the net funded status of pension and other post retirement benefit obligations as of december  decreased shareholders equity by billion  and increased the ratio of debt to shareholders equity and the ratio of debt to capital resources by points and points  respectively 
as shown in the table below  our financial ratings were not impacted by this adoption

share repurchases we completed our billion share repurchase program that commenced in january during november  and commenced a billion share repurchase program that is expected to be completed by march  as of december   this program had billion remaining 
since  we have acquired million shares of our common stock at a cost of billion  primarily as part of various stock repurchase programs 
we have reissued million shares since  primarily associated with our equity incentive plans  the acquisition of american heritage life investment corporation ahl and the redemption of certain mandatorily redeemable preferred securities 
the impact of our repurchase programs on total shares outstanding since has been a net reduction of million shares or 
debt decreased in  primarily due to net decreases in long term debt and short term debt consisting of commercial paper borrowings 
long term debt decreased due to the december  repayment of million of senior notes in accordance with their scheduled maturity 
we also elected to redeem our million of junior subordinated debentures due in  thereby triggering the redemption of  shares of the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust trust preferred securities originally issued by allstate financing ii  an unconsolidated variable interest entity vie 
the debentures and trust preferred securities were redeemed at a price of plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in  we also purchased a headquarters office building previously owned by a consolidated synthetic lease vie for million  further reducing long term debt 
these redemptions were made from available sources of liquidity including the issuance in march of million of senior notes due  utilizing the registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission sec in august debt decreased in  primarily due to decreases in long term debt partially offset by increased commercial paper borrowings 
in may  we issued million of senior notes due  utilizing the registration statement filed with the sec in august the proceeds of this issuance were used for general corporate purposes including to fund the repayment of a portion of the million of senior notes due  which were repaid at their scheduled maturity  may  in july  we liquidated our consolidated investment management vie 
as a result of the liquidation  long term debt decreased by million 
at december   there were no outstanding commercial paper borrowings

allstate s domestic property liability and life insurance subsidiaries prepare their statutory basis financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the applicable state of domicile 
statutory surplus is a measure that is often used as a basis for determining dividend paying capacity  operating leverage and premium growth capacity  and it is also reviewed by rating agencies in determining their ratings 
as of december   aic s statutory surplus is approximately billion compared to billion at december  the ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is a common measure of operating leverage used in the property casualty insurance industry and serves as an indicator of a company s premium growth capacity 
ratios in excess of to are typically considered outside the usual range by insurance regulators and rating agencies 
aic s premium to surplus ratio was x on december  compared to x in the prior year 
we have distinct groups of subsidiaries licensed to sell property and casualty insurance in new jersey and florida that maintain separate group ratings 
the ratings of these groups are influenced by the risks that relate specifically to each group 
many mortgage companies require property owners to have insurance from an insurance carrier with a secure financial strength rating from an accredited rating agency 
allstate new jersey insurance company and encompass insurance company of new jersey  which write auto and homeowners insurance  are rated a by am best 
allstate new jersey insurance company also has a demotech rating of a

state laws specify regulatory actions if an insurer s risk based capital rbc  a measure of an insurer s solvency  falls below certain levels 
the naic has a standard formula for annually assessing rbc 
the formula for calculating rbc for property liability companies takes into account asset and credit risks but places more emphasis on underwriting factors for reserving and pricing 
the formula for calculating rbc for life insurance companies takes into account factors relating to insurance  business  asset and interest rate risks 
at december   the rbc for each of our domestic insurance companies was above levels that would require regulatory actions 
the naic has also developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the insurance regulatory information system to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by insurance regulatory authorities 
the naic analyzes financial data provided by insurance companies using prescribed ratios  each with defined usual ranges 
generally  regulators will begin to monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios 
if an insurance company has insufficient capital  regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue 
the ratios of our domestic insurance companies are within these ranges

cash flows used in investing activities in also include the settlements related to the disposition through reinsurance of substantially all our variable annuity business 
cash flows used in investing activities decreased in due to lower cash provided by financing in  compared to  increased proceeds from sales of securities and higher investment collections  partially offset by the investment of higher operating cash flows 
cash used in financing activities increased in as a result of lower contractholder fund deposits and higher surrenders and partial withdrawals 
lower cash flows provided by financing activities in  compared to  were primarily due to higher surrenders of market value adjusted annuities  lower deposits on fixed annuities and institutional products  and increased maturities of institutional products 
for quantification of the changes in contractholder funds  see the allstate financial segment section of the md a 
a portion of the allstate financial product portfolio  primarily fixed annuity and interest sensitive life insurance products  is subject to surrender and withdrawal at the discretion of contractholders 
the following table summarizes allstate financial s liabilities for these products by their contractual withdrawal provisions at december  in millions not subject to discretionary withdrawal  subject to discretionary withdrawal with adjustments specified surrender charges  market value  subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustments  total contractholder funds  includes billion of liabilities with a contractual surrender charge of less than of the account balance 
approximately billion of the contracts with market value adjusted surrenders have a day period during which there is no surrender charge or market value adjustment including approximately billion with a period commencing during includes approximately billion of contractholder funds on variable annuities reinsured to prudential effective june  to ensure we have the appropriate level of liquidity in this segment  we perform actuarial tests on the impact to cash flows of policy surrenders and other actions under various scenarios 
depending upon the years in which certain policy types were sold with specific surrender provisions  the allstate financial cash flow could vary due to higher surrender of policies exiting their surrender charge periods 
corporate and other fluctuations in the corporate and other operating cash flows  were primarily due to the timing of intercompany settlements 
investing activities primarily relate to activity in the portfolio of kennett capital  inc kennett capital 
financing cash flows of the corporate and other segment reflect actions such as fluctuations in short term debt  repayment of debt  proceeds from the issuance of debt  dividends to shareholders of the allstate corporation and share repurchases  therefore  financing cash flows are affected when we increase or decrease the level of these activities 
we have established external sources of short term liquidity that include a commercial paper program  lines of credit  dollar rolls and repurchase agreements 
in the aggregate  at december   these sources could provide over billion of additional liquidity 
for additional liquidity  we can also issue new insurance contracts  incur additional debt and sell assets from our investment portfolio 
the liquidity of our investment portfolio varies by type of investment 
for example  billion of privately placed corporate obligations that represent of the consolidated investment portfolio  and billion of mortgage loans that represent of the consolidated investment portfolio  generally are considered to be less liquid than many of our other types of investments  such as our us government and agencies  municipal and public corporate fixed income security portfolios 
the sources of liquidity for the allstate corporation include but are not limited to dividends from aic and billion of investments at kennett capital 
we have access to additional borrowing to support liquidity as follows a commercial paper program with a borrowing limit of billion to cover short term cash needs 
as of december   there were no balances outstanding and therefore the remaining borrowing capacity was billion  however  the outstanding balance fluctuates daily 
a five year revolving credit facility expiring in totaling billion to cover short term liquidity requirements 
this facility contains an increase provision that would make up to an additional million available for borrowing provided the increased portion could be fully syndicated at a later date among existing or new lenders 
although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement  the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of our senior  unsecured  nonguaranteed long term debt 
there were no borrowings under this line of credit during the total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the credit facility cannot exceed the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facility 
a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in may we can use it to issue an unspecified amount of debt securities  common stock including million shares of treasury stock as of december   preferred stock  depositary shares  warrants  stock purchase contracts  stock purchase units and securities of subsidiaries 
the specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements 
we have not yet issued any securities under this registration statement 
our only financial covenant exists with respect to our credit facility and our synthetic lease vie obligations 
the covenant requires that we not exceed a debt to capital resources ratio as defined in the agreements 
this ratio at december  was 
for quantification of the synthetic lease vie obligations  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
we closely monitor and manage our liquidity through long and short term planning that is integrated throughout the corporation  the business segments and investments 
allstate financial manages the duration of assets and related liabilities through its alm organization  using a dynamic process that addresses liquidity utilizing the investment portfolio  and components of the portfolio as appropriate  which is routinely subjected to stress testing 
allstate protection s underwriting cash transactions comprise millions of small transactions that make it possible to statistically determine reasonable expectations of patterns of liquidity  which are subject to volatility from unpredictable catastrophe losses 
property liability monitors the duration of its assets and liabilities and maintains a portfolio of highly liquid fixed income and equity securities  including short term investments  exchange traded common stock  municipal bonds  corporate bonds  and us government and government agency securities in order to address the variability of its cash flows 
discontinued lines and coverages liabilities are expected to be paid over many years and do not present a significant liquidity risk 
allstate financial and property liability also have access to funds from our commercial paper program 
during  alic issued an intercompany note in the amount of million payable to its parent  aic  on demand and  in any event  by march  alic used the funds to accelerate purchases of investments based on its outlook of the availability of acceptable investments in the beginning of alic will repay the loan with funds generated in the normal course of business  primarily by sales  investment income and cash collected from investment calls and maturities 
the impacts of this loan are eliminated in consolidation 
certain remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity 
those events and circumstances include  for example  a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses  a downgrade in our long term debt rating of a  a and a from moody s  standard poor s and am best  respectively to non investment grade status of below baa bbb bb  a downgrade in aic s financial strength rating from aa  aa and a from moody s  standard poor s and am best  respectively to below baa bbb a  or a downgrade in alic s financial strength ratings from aa  aa and a from moody s  standard poor s and am best  respectively to below aa aa a 
the rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities  therefore  a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations as of december  and the payments due by period are shown in the following table 
in millions total less than year years years over years liabilities for collateral and repurchase agreements  commercial paper contractholder funds     reserve for life contingent contract benefits   long term debt    capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans   reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense other liabilities and accrued expenses   total contractual cash obligations    liabilities for collateral and repurchase agreements are typically fully secured with cash 
we manage our short term liquidity position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short term liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business 
contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as interest sensitive life  fixed annuities  including immediate annuities without life contingencies  bank deposits and institutional products 
these amounts reflect estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and contractholders 
certain of these contracts  such as immediate annuities without life contingencies and institutional products  involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of the payment is essentially fixed and determinable 
these amounts relate to i policies or contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so and ii contracts where the timing of payments has been determined by the contract 
other contracts  such as interest sensitive life and fixed deferred annuities  involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain 
for these contracts and bank deposits  the company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until i the occurrence of an insurable event  such as death  or ii the occurrence of a payment triggering event  such as the surrender of or partial withdrawal on a policy or deposit contract  which is outside of the control of the company 
we have estimated the timing of payments related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns 
uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality  customer lapse and withdrawal activity  and estimated additional deposits for interest sensitive life contracts  which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments 
such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality  retirement  and other appropriate factors  but are undiscounted with respect to interest 
as a result  the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount of billion included in the consolidated statements of financial position as of december  for contractholder funds 
the liability amount in the consolidated statements of financial position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above 
the reserve for life contingent contract benefits relates primarily to traditional life and immediate annuities with life contingencies and reflects the present value of estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and contractholders 
immediate annuities with life contingencies include i contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so until the occurrence of a specific event such as death and ii contracts where the timing of a portion of the payments has been determined by the contract 
other contracts  such as traditional life and supplemental accident and health insurance  involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain 
for these contracts  the company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until i the occurrence of an insurable event  such as death or illness  or ii the occurrence of a payment triggering event  such as a surrender of a policy or contract  which is outside of the control of the company 
we have estimated the timing of cash outflows related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns 
uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality  morbidity  expenses  customer lapse and withdrawal activity  and renewal premium for life policies  which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments 
such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality  retirement  and other appropriate factors  but are undiscounted with respect to interest 
as a result  the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount of billion included in the consolidated statements of financial position as of december  for reserve for life contingent contract benefits 
the liability amount in the consolidated statements of financial position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above 
our payment obligations relating to long term debt  capital lease obligations  operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations and pension contributions are managed within the structure of our intermediate to long term liquidity management program 
amount differs from the balance presented on the consolidated statements of financial position as of december  because the long term debt amount above includes interest 
the pension plans obligations in the next months represent our planned contributions  and the remaining years contributions are projected based on the average remaining service period using the current underfunded status of the plans 
the opeb plans obligations are estimated based on the expected benefits to be paid 
these liabilities are discounted with respect to interest  and as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of billion exceeds the corresponding liability amount of billion included in other liabilities and accrued expenses on the consolidated statements of financial position 
reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
we have estimated the timing of these payments based on our historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns 
however  the timing of these payments may vary significantly from the amounts shown above  especially for those claims that have been incurred but not reported 
the reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense includes loss reserves related to asbestos and environmental claims as of december   of billion and million  respectively 
other liabilities primarily include accrued expenses and certain benefit obligations and claim payments and other checks outstanding 
certain of these long term liabilities are discounted with respect to interest  as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount of billion 
balance sheet liabilities not included in the table above include unearned and advance premiums of billion and deferred tax liabilities netted in the net deferred tax asset of million 
these items were excluded as they do not meet the definition of a contractual liability as we are not contractually obligated to pay these amounts to third parties 
rather  they represent an accounting mechanism that allows us to present our financial statements on an accrual basis 
in addition  other liabilities of million were not included in the table above because they did not represent a contractual obligation or the amount and timing of their eventual payment was sufficiently uncertain 
our contractual commitments as of december  and the payments due by period are shown in the following table 
in millions total less than year years years over years other commitments conditional other commitments unconditional  total commitments  represents investment commitments such as private placements and mortgage loans 
we have agreements in place for services we conduct  generally at cost  between subsidiaries relating to insurance  reinsurance  loans and capitalization 
all material inter company transactions have appropriately been eliminated in consolidation 
inter company transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance as required

enterprise risk management allstate has been working on enterprise risk management erm for five years  establishing processes and infrastructure to effectively manage risk within our tolerances while optimizing returns 
we have a senior management advisory committee called the enterprise risk return council errc which is responsible for overseeing risks on an integrated basis across subsidiaries and various areas of responsibility within allstate 
in the vision of the errc  enterprise risk management is a disciplined  holistic  and interactive approach to risk that is conducted under an overall framework which provides additional insight when setting strategy across the allstate enterprise identifies potential events that could have a significant impact on allstate manages risk and optimizes our overall profile consistent with allstate s risk appetite provides greater assurance of achieving allstate s objectives allows allstate to achieve a return commensurate with the risks taken risk management is primarily executed within the business unit where the risk is undertaken 
effective risk management requires an infrastructure that includes appropriate governance policies  stochastic modeling software  tolerances and limits  consistent risk management practices  which include risk identification  evaluation  prioritization  treatment and monitoring  and effective communication and reporting 
managers in the various business units are responsible for managing  measuring  evaluating  and reporting risks as appropriate in their respective areas and that are within the risk appetite of the overall enterprise 
this would include items such as establishing risk oversight committees that develop and monitor appropriate tolerances and the measurement of exposure to any catastrophe  managing the impacts to invested assets and liabilities related to changes in interest rates and equity markets through value at risk  duration and convexity metrics  and evaluating risks related to credit exposures through a credit value at risk measurement 
as appropriate  consistent enterprise wide measurement standards and limits are applied to these key risks and are integrated into such processes as strategic and financial planning  capital management  and enterprise risk reporting 
business unit measures and practices are aligned with the overall enterprise standards 
for the enterprise  we are utilizing an internally developed enterprise stochastic model as a significant component in our determination of an appropriate level of economic capital needed  given a defined tolerance for risk 
economic capital modeling capabilities enable us to more fully understand and optimize risk reward tradeoffs across the portfolio of businesses and various risks 
the economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature and interaction of the risks inherent in our various businesses 
future plans include further refinements to our modeling capabilities to provide more insight to optimizing enterprise return with an acceptable risk profile by proactively exploiting risk reduction and risk enhancing opportunities 
over time  this effort should provide additional insight into the marginal risk return choices in such areas as capital management  strategic asset allocation in our investment portfolio  product mix and choices of risk transfer options for state  regional  or countrywide catastrophe exposure management 
regulation and legal proceedings we are subject to extensive regulation and we are involved in various legal and regulatory actions  all of which have an effect on specific aspects of our business 
for a detailed discussion of the legal and regulatory actions in which we are involved  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
pending accounting standards as of december   there are several pending accounting standards that we have not implemented either because the standard has not been finalized or the implementation date has not yet occurred 
for a discussion of these pending standards  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the standard and other factors we are unable to determine prior to implementation 
for this reason  we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending accounting standards until the relevant authoritative body finalizes these standards or until we implement them
