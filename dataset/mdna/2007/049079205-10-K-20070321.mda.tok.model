item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide wireless and wireline telecommunications services in the caribbean and north america through the following operating subsidiaries and affiliate guyana telephone telegraph company  ltd 
or gt t is the national and international telephone company in the republic of guyana and the largest wireless service provider in that country 
we acquired an equity interest in gt t in commnet wireless  llc is an owner and operator of wholesale wireless networks in rural areas of the united states 
commnet provides wireless voice and data communications roaming services primarily to national  regional and local wireless carriers 
we acquired a interest in commnet in september and the remaining in january sovernet  inc is a facilities based integrated voice  broadband data communications and dial up services provider in new england  primarily in vermont 
we acquired sovernet in february and granted restricted stock equal to of the equity to sovernet s new ceo 
bermuda digital communications  ltd 
or bdc is the largest wireless voice and data communications service provider in bermuda  doing business under the name cellular one 
we acquired a minority equity interest now in  and signed a management contract with  bdc in choice communications  llc is a leading provider of fixed wireless broadband data services and dial up internet services to retail and business customers in the us virgin islands 
choice also provides fixed wireless digital television services in the us virgin islands 
choice acquired its internet service business in and its television business in march we acquired choice in october and own of the equity 
as a holding company  atlantic tele network provides management  technical  financial  regulatory  and marketing services to  and typically receives a management fee equal to approximately of revenues from each operating subsidiary and our bdc affiliate 
because we do not control bdc  we account for our investment in that entity under the equity method 
earnings from bdc do not appear in our income from operations  but are instead reflected in equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  net of tax in the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in july  bdc has the option to repurchase from us all  but not less than all  of our equity interest in bdc at a price equal to fair market value  we currently believe that bdc is likely to exercise this option 
also in  our management fee arrangement with bdc may be terminated pursuant to contract

for information about our business segments and geographical information about our operating revenues and long lived assets  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
historically  we have generated most of our revenue and operating income from our gt t operations 
gt t provides domestic wireline telephone service and international long distance service pursuant to an exclusive license from the government of guyana and provides wireless service on a non exclusive basis 
the rates that gt t may charge for its services are regulated by the public utility commission of guyana or puc  an independent regulatory body responsible for regulating telecommunications 
see business regulation of our gt t subsidiary 
the largest component of gt t s contribution to our consolidated revenue and profit has been from its international long distance business and that business still accounts for roughly half of gt t s revenue 
most of these revenues and profits were from payment by foreign carriers  which are denominated in us dollars  for handling international long distance calls originating from foreign carrier s terminating in guyana 
the rates at which gt t collects fees from foreign carriers are established by agreements between it and foreign carriers  and can be affected by limits set by foreign telecommunications regulators  especially the us federal communications commission or fcc 
the primary drivers of the long distance business are the population of guyanese living abroad who initiate calls to guyana  the rate foreign carriers pay gt t for handling the incoming international calls  and the number of people in guyana capable of receiving international long distance calls  which consist of wireline telephone customers and all the wireless subscribers in guyana including subscribers to competitor wireless service providers 
in additional  in recent years  we believe various methods of illegal bypass and alternative and cheaper media for communication  such as e mail and text messaging  may be causing a decline in both voice traffic and in international long distance revenues 
we have taken a number of measures to counter illegal bypass  including taking action against unlicensed operators in guyana  introducing special outbound call center rates and we are examining automated technical solutions as well 
in and  we opportunistically entered new businesses and markets through our acquisitions of commnet and sovernet 
these businesses have provided us with new sources of revenues and with growth opportunities 
as a result  while gt t continues to represent a majority of our revenues and profits  its relative contribution to our consolidated revenues has declined in recent years 
for fiscal years  and  gt t generated  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenue and we expect this trend to continue 
commnet generated over two thirds of our wireless revenue in and accounted for approximately of the increase in wireless revenue over sovernet generated over of our local telephone and data revenue and accounted for more than of the increase in local telephone and data revenue 
during the year we invested million expanding the geographic coverage and technical capabilities of commnet s wireless network by purchasing spectrum licenses  adding additional gsm and cdma sites and switching equipment  as well as adding gprs and or edge data technologies in many of our markets 
in  we will continue to invest in expanding our networks in guyana  commnet and sovernet and expect to incur capital expenditures between million and million  with over half made in connection with commnet 
we are actively evaluating additional acquisition opportunities of businesses that meet our return on investment  strategic approach and other acquisition criteria 
as a result of our underwritten public offering of common stock in july  we raised net proceeds of approximately million  of which a portion was used to repay outstanding indebtedness  and the remainder of which we plan to use to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions and or strategic investments and general corporate purposes 
while our gt t operations continue to grow  we face challenges in guyana 
since  the government of guyana has stated its intention to introduce competition into guyana s wireline sector 
recently  senior guyanese officials have indicated to us a renewed interest in conducting negotiations between gt t and the government of guyana regarding the exclusivity terms of gt t s license  and we expect these discussions will cover all significant outstanding issues  including tax matters 
gt t has not had formal discussions with government officials regarding these matters since the second quarter of see business regulation of our gt t subsidiary 
we believe that the introduction of international voice and data competition would require the termination of the exclusivity provisions of gt t s license  and thus would require appropriate compensation to gt t and a likely increase in local wireline service rates so that those rates reflect the actual cost of providing such services 
gt t is also in the process of adapting to recent changes in the competitive environment for wireless services in guyana 
in november  our only nationwide wireless competitor was acquired by digicel  a large mobile telecommunications company operating in many caribbean countries 
we expect this development to significantly increase the competition we face in the guyana wireless market 
in anticipation of this development  we have accelerated the timing of some of our capital expenditures on network improvements 
we believe that network coverage and quality of service and price are the key bases on which we compete 
during the fourth quarter of  we also increased our marketing expenditures  including handset subsidies and other promotionals  designed to accelerate the migration of subscribers from our tdma network to our gsm network  which allows us to offer richer handset features and certain wireless data services  while increasing our network capacity 
we have also modified some of our pricing plans 
we expect that this heightened competition will result in higher marketing expense for us at least in the short term and may have adverse effects on pricing and our market share

we acquired commnet on september  and sovernet on february  wireless revenue 
wireless revenue includes wholesale voice and data roaming revenue from our rural us operations and retail wireless revenues generated in guyana  including airtime and activation fees 
wireless revenue increased to million for from million for  an increase of million  or 
our rural us business  which was acquired in september  was responsible for million of this increase 
this business s contribution to revenue also increased throughout the year  due primarily to our acquisitions and continued deployment of additional gsm and cdma wireless base stations  with a total of base stations deployed as of december  as compared to base stations as of december  
our rural wireless revenue also increased as a result of growth in voice and data traffic at existing sites and new international roaming revenue 
the remaining increase in wireless revenue was attributable to the continued growth of our wireless subscriber base in guyana 
the number of our wireless subscribers in guyana increased by  subscribers  or  from  subscribers to  subscribers as of december  and  respectively 
gt t s wireless revenue was million and million for and  respectively 
while we experienced wireless revenue growth in guyana  revenue growth trailed subscriber growth as wireless arpu average revenue per user has continued to decline 
we believe this decline in the arpu reflects a number of factors  including the penetration of the wireless product into a lower usage demographic and our belief that some portion of the subscriber growth is a result of some new gsm customers retaining their old tdma handsets and accounts for the time being 
however  the portion of our pre paid subscribers with tdma handsets declined substantially in  particularly in the fourth quarter  in large part due to aggressive promotions aimed at converting those subscribers to our gsm services 
approximately  of gt t s wireless subscribers were gsm gprs subscribers as of december  as compared to  as of december  we expect that wholesale wireless revenue from our rural us network will continue to increase in as we continue to expand our gsm and cdma networks in the rural united states and as minutes of use and bytes continue to grow on our existing sites 
in our retail wireless business  we expect that the network capacity and coverage we have added will lead to increased revenue  although competitive pressures may reduce expected growth or even cause a decline in this revenue 
our previous wireless competitor in guyana was acquired by a large telecommunications company with operations in several carribean countries that has announced plans to invest significant sums in expanding the service offerings and network capability of its network 
this competitor has already launched extensive promotions  particularly handset subsidies  and we expect it to continue throughout the coming year 
in turn  we have continued and expanded upon our promotions  including substantial handset subsidies 
we have also accelerated our capital build plan to more rapidly increase our geographic coverage and our gsm network capacity and capabilities 
local telephone and data revenue 
local telephone and data revenue is generated by our wireline operations in guyana  our integrated voice and data operations in vermont  and our data services in the us virgin islands 
this revenue includes basic service fees  measured service revenue  and internet access fees  as well as installation charges for new lines  monthly line rental charges  long distance or toll charges  excluding international long distance charges in guyana  maintenance and equipment sales 
local telephone and data revenue increased by million  or  to million for from million for sovernet  our vermont based voice and data provider  which was acquired in february  contributed million of this increase 
the remaining increase of million is primarily attributable to growth in gt t s access lines in guyana from approximately  lines as of december  to approximately  lines as of december  an increase of  growth in broadband data customers in guyana and continued strong growth in wireless broadband customers in the us virgin islands 
in future periods  apart from the addition of sovernet s revenue  we anticipate that local telephone and data revenue will increase as a result of network and subscriber growth in vermont  particularly in the small and medium sized businesses  including neighboring areas of new england  and network and subscriber growth in guyana and the us virgin islands 
international long distance revenue 
international long distance revenue is generated by international telephone calls into and out of guyana and does not include international long distance revenue generated by our us businesses 
inbound traffic  which made up of all international long distance traffic and more than three quarters of international long distance revenue for the year ended december   is settled in us dollars 
international long distance revenue increased by million  or  from million for to million for the increase was primarily the result of an increase in inbound traffic or minutes of use  offset by a decline in outbound international calls originating in guyana traffic 
we believe that the increase in inbound traffic was driven by increased access lines and wireless handsets in service and that the decrease in outbound traffic reflects an increase in the use of bypass methods such as internet calling 
while overall internet penetration in guyana is modest  we are reviewing measures to counter any illegal bypass of our exclusive right to handle international voice and data traffic 
in addition to the illegal bypass  technological change has offered alternative and cheaper media for communication  such as e mail and text messaging 
this shift in modes of communication may cause a decline in both voice traffic and in international long distance revenues 
other revenue 
other revenue represents revenue from digital television services in the us virgin islands  which increased to million for from million for the increase in television services was a result of a increase in television subscribers  including additional hotel rooms 
the increase also reflects a price increase in february in the near term  we expect this category of revenue will largely be driven by our television subscriber base which we expect to continue to increase  although likely at a lesser rate than in termination and access fee expenses 
termination and access fee expenses are charges that we pay for voice and data transport circuits in particular  the circuits between our rural wireless sites and our switches  internet capacity and other access fees we pay to terminate our outbound toll and international calls 
termination and access fees increased by million  or  from million to million from to  respectively 
net of the addition of commnet s and sovernet s combined expenses of million for  our termination and access fees decreased by million from to because of lower long distance expenses in guyana and the cessation of operations at our atlantic tele center subsidiary 
these expenses are expected to increase in future periods as our rural wireless and clec operations expand 
internet and programming expenses 
internet and programming expenses include digital television programming costs as well as internet connectivity charges 
internet and programming expenses increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily from the addition of our vermont operations and the growth in our television and broadband data subscribers in the us virgin islands 
we expect that the addition of our vermont operations will increase our internet and programming expenses in future periods 
however  in december we were able to significantly reduce the internet capacity expenses for our virgin island operations which will offset partly the increases related to expending television and broadband operations 
engineering and operations expenses 
engineering and operations expenses include the expenses associated with developing  operating  supporting and expanding our networks including the salaries and benefits paid for employees directly involved in the development and operation of our networks 
engineering and operations expenses increased by million  or  from million to million for to  respectively 
this increase is the result of the addition of our recently acquired businesses which together accounted for additional engineering and operations expenses of approximately million during net of our recently acquired businesses  engineering and operations expenses were down slightly  mostly due to cost reduction efforts in the us virgin islands 
we expect that our engineering and operations expenses will increase in future periods as a result of our expanding telecommunications networks 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales  marketing and customer service expenses include salaries and benefits we pay for sales personnel  customer service expenses  sales commissions and the costs associated with the development and implementation of our promotion and marketing campaigns 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million  or  from million to million from to  respectively 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses is the result of the addition of our vermont operations  which added million of expenses during  as well as additional costs needed to provide customer service to our larger subscriber bases and additional costs in guyana to market our wireless services 
in guyana  marketing expenses  particularly handset subsidies  rose significantly in the fourth quarter as a result of increased competition 
sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate somewhat in the future depending on the competitive environment and the timing of the launch of new services  but  over time  we expect these expenses to increase due to the overall expansion of our operations  in particular  the addition of our vermont operations and increased wireless competition in guyana 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include salaries  benefits and related costs for general corporate functions  including executive management  finance and administration  legal and regulatory  facilities  information technology and human resources 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million to million from to  respectively 
this increase is primarily attributable to the addition of our recently acquired businesses which added million of additional overhead expenses during without these new operations  our general and administrative expenses increased by million  which is primarily attributable to an increase in accounting and professional fees relating  in part  to our obligation to be in compliance with the internal controls requirements of sarbanes oxley  as well as an increase in non cash equity based compensation and additional compensation and overhead costs to support our growth 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses represent the depreciation and amortization charges we record on our property and equipment and on our intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million  or  from million to million for and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the addition of fixed assets from our recent acquisitions as well as the amortization of intangible assets at sovernet 
we expect that depreciation and amortization expenses will increase in the near term  because of continued capital expenditures to support growth in our networks 
interest expense 
interest expense represents interest incurred on our outstanding debt including our million term loan as well as the outstanding amounts under our million revolving line of credit facility which replaced our previous million line of credit in september interest expense increased from million for to million for this increase is primarily the result of increased borrowings used to help fund our recent acquisitions 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the underwritten public offering of our common stock in july to repay the borrowings under the line of credit 
as such there were no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit as of december  interest income 
interest income represents interest earned on our cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest income increased from million to million for and  respectively  due to an overall increase in our cash balances as result of the stock offering 
other income expense 
other income expense represents miscellaneous non operational income we earned  or expenses we incurred  including management fees received bdc and other unconsolidated affiliates 
other income expense improved from an expense in of million to income of million in this was due primarily to the negative impact in of an increase in the reserve for our advances to bridge international communications 
income taxes 
income taxes represent taxes we pay on our net taxable income 
the effective tax rate was and for and  respectively  which represents the statutory us income tax rate plus the guyanese income taxes in excess of the statutory us income tax rates as well as certain us state income taxes 
the effective tax rate is also impacted by the amortization of a deferred tax asset  relating to differences between book and tax basis of fixed assets  which was recorded in a prior period 
our higher effective tax rate for the period reflects the fact that our losses in the us virgin islands and some of the curtailed businesses were not available to reduce taxable income in guyana  which has a high tax rate of 
the reduction in our effective rate in is a result of the impact of additional taxable income at us statutory rates  and an adjustment relating to our accrual for taxes  which were filed in further reductions in our effective tax rate may occur if we are able to continue reducing losses in the us virgin islands and grow taxable income at our newer us operations 
minority interests 
minority interests consists of the guyana government s interest in gt t  a minority shareholder s interest in commnet  other minority shareholders interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries of commnet and a minority shareholder s interest in sovernet 
minority interest increased from million to million for and  respectively  due to an increase in net income at gt t as well as the addition of commnet and sovernet which were acquired in september and february  respectively 
minority interest amounts are likely to decline in due to our january purchase of the minority interest in commnet 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates includes our share of the earnings of bdc  our wireless affiliate in bermuda  as well as our share of the earnings of commnet s unconsolidated affiliates 
the decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates from million to million for and  respectively  was primarily due to increased competition in bermuda resulting in a decrease in subscribers as well as increased marketing and handset expenses incurred in response to this increased competition 
wireless subscribers in bermuda were  and  as of and  respectively 
net income 
as a result of the above factors  net income increased by million or from million for to million for on a per share basis  net income increased from per basic and per diluted share to per basic and per diluted share net income in was adversely impacted by the million reserve taken against our advances to bridge international communications 
excluding the impact of this reserve  net income would have increased by million from to segment results 
we have four material operating segments  which we manage and evaluate separately integrated telephony international  integrated telephony domestic  wireless television and data  and rural wireless

wireless revenue represents the wholesale voice and data roaming revenue of commnet  which was acquired on september   as well as gt t s wireless revenues  including airtime and activation fees 
wireless revenue increased to million for from million for  an increase of million  or 
of the million increase  commnet contributed million of wireless revenue since its acquisition 
the remaining increase of million was attributable to the continued growth of our cellular subscriber base in guyana as the number of our subscribers increased from  to  as of december  and  respectively 
as noted previously  management believes that some portion of the subscriber growth in was a result of some new gsm customers retaining their old tdma handsets and accounts 
approximately  of our wireless subscribers were gsm gprs subscribers as of december  local telephone and data revenue 
local telephone and data revenue largely represents the basic service fees  measured service revenue  internet access fees and other revenues generated by our fixed wireline network in guyana  such as installation charges for new lines  monthly line rental charges  maintenance and equipment sales 
local telephone and data revenue also includes internet access fees generated by our data network in the us virgin islands and  in future periods  will include local telephone and data revenue generated by sovernet in vermont 
local telephone and data revenue increased by million  or  to million for from million for the increase is primarily attributable to the growth in local revenue at gt t resulting from increased local calling volume and a higher number of access lines in use 
local revenue was also positively impacted by increases in choice s wireless broadband subscribers offset  in part  by the attrition of dial up subscribers 
international long distance revenue 
international long distance revenue is primarily generated by international telephone calls into and out of guyana 
inbound traffic  which makes up more than of this revenue  is settled in us dollars 
international long distance revenue decreased by million  or  from million in to million in however  revenue for included a previously disclosed million settlement of amounts paid to us by a large international carrier that were significantly past due and written off in a prior period 
net of this settlement  international long distance revenue remained relatively unchanged from to the lack of growth of this revenue was unexpected given the expansion of our wireless subscribers and our access lines in guyana 
we would have expected international long distance revenue to increase with more handsets and access lines in service 
our wireless subscribers increased by more than and our access lines by about as discussed above 
gt t s access lines increased from  to  as of december  and  respectively  as we continued our efforts to bring new areas of guyana into service 
one of the reasons for the lack of growth in international long distance revenue  we believe  is the growth in unauthorized internet calling 
while this mainly impacts outbound calls  forms of bypass ie  international calls that are routed around our international exchange through technologies such as voip using internet calling and other mechanisms may be increasing 
despite the lack of growth in this category  the contribution of international long distance to our operating profits actually grew because of a greater percentage decline in long distance expenses  as discussed below 
other revenue 
other revenue represents revenue from choice s digital television services in the us virgin islands  which increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in television services was a result of an increase in television subscribers from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december   including additional hotel rooms 
termination and access fee expenses 
termination and access fee expenses are charges that we pay to international carriers to terminate our outbound telephone traffic as well as for certain circuit and bandwidth costs 
termination and access fees increased by million  or  from million to million from to net of commnet s expenses of million for a portion of  our termination and access fees decreased by million from to because of lower long distance expenses in guyana 
internet and programming expenses 
internet and programming expenses include digital television programming costs as well as internet connectivity charges 
internet and programming expenses increased from million to million  primarily because of the growth in our television and broadband internet subscribers at choice 
engineering and operations expenses 
engineering and operations expenses include the expenses associated with developing  operating  supporting and expanding our networks including the salaries and benefits paid for employees directly involved in the development and operation of our networks 
engineering and operations expenses increased by million  or  from million to million from to this increase is the result of the increase in costs to support our expanding networks and subscriber bases 
a higher per unit cost of fuel and power in guyana also contributed to this increase as did the addition of commnet 
sales  marketing and customer service expenses 
sales  marketing and customer service expenses include expenses relating to the salaries and benefits that we pay for sales personnel and the expenses associated with the development and implementation of our promotion and marketing campaigns  as well as customer service expenses 
sales  marketing and customer service expenses increased by million  or  from million to million from to the increase in sales and marketing expenses is the result of additional costs needed to provide customer service to our increased subscriber bases as well as more aggressive marketing and sales initiatives in guyana in connection with competition for gsm market share 
both we and our main competitor launched gsm services in guyana in the fourth quarter of general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include salaries  benefits and related costs for general corporate functions  including executive management  finance and administration  legal and regulatory  facilities  information technology and human resources 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million to million from to this increase is primarily attributable to the addition of commnet which added million of overhead expenses during depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses represent the depreciation charges we record on our property and equipment 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million  or  from million to million for and  respectively 
the increase is due to the expansion of our networks  primarily in guyana  to support increased subscriber bases 
a portion of the increase reflects the addition of commnet s assets on september  interest expense 
interest expense represents interest incurred on our outstanding debt including our million term loan as well as the outstanding amounts under our million revolving line of credit facility 
interest expense increased from million for to million for this increase is primarily the result of increased expense from the borrowings used to complete the acquisition of commnet on september  interest income 
interest income represents interest earned on our cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest income increased from million to million for and  respectively  due to an overall increase in our cash balances 
other income expense 
other income expense represents miscellaneous non operational income earned by  or expenses incurred by  us including management fees received from our unconsolidated affiliates  mainly bdc 
other income expense decreased from an expense of million for to an expense of million for while management fees from bdc remained relatively unchanged at million for both and  both years were impacted by substantial one time gains or impairments 
the fiscal year includes foreign exchange gains of million which were more than offset by a write down of the goodwill of choice of million  an impairment of atc s assets of million  an impairment of call home telecom s assets of million and a write off for secured loans made in connection with our investment in lightrade  inc of million for for  other income expense includes a reserve for our advances to bridge international communications  inc of million  offset by miscellaneous income of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we established the reserve against amounts due from bridge as bridge has had difficulty closing contracts for its primary business line of managed network services 
income taxes 
income taxes represent taxes we pay on our net taxable income 
the effective tax rate was and for and  respectively  which represents the statutory us income tax rate plus the guyanese income taxes in excess of the statutory us income tax rates as well as certain us state income taxes and the amortization of a deferred tax asset which was recorded in a prior period 
our high effective tax rate for these periods reflects the fact that our losses at choice and some of the curtailed businesses were not available to reduce taxable income in guyana  which has a high tax rate of 
minority interests 
minority interests consists of the guyana government s interest in gt t  a minority shareholder s interest in commnet and other minority shareholder s interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries of commnet 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates includes our share of the earnings of bdc  our cellular affiliate in bermuda  as well as our share of the earnings of commnet s unconsolidated investments 
equity in the earnings of bdc increased from million to million from to  respectively 
this increase primarily reflects increased roaming and long distance revenues partially stemming from an increase of  subscribers  or  from  as of december  to  at december  for  equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates also includes million of earnings from commnet s unconsolidated affiliates 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per basic and per diluted share  as compared to million  or per basic and diluted share for the increase of million or was attributable to the net income of commnet since its acquisition on september   partially offset by a reserve against the amounts due from bridge 
regulatory and tax issues we are involved in a number of regulatory and tax proceedings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
a material and adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and future operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have met our operational liquidity needs through a combination of cash on hand and internally generated funds and have funded capital expenditures and acquisitions with a combination of internally generated funds  cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility 
uses of cash capital expenditures 
a significant use of our cash has been for capital expenditures to expand and upgrade our networks 
in  we spent approximately million for capital expenditures  including million to purchase spectrum licenses and switching and cell site equipment required to expand the geographic coverage and technical capabilities of commnet s wireless network 
at commnet  we added gsm and cdma base stations  data capabilities in many markets  a new cdma central office switch and enhanced microwave relay capabilities 
in addition  approximately million was incurred expanding the capacity and coverage of our wireless network in guyana 
as of december   we had invested approximately million in the guyanese telecommunications infrastructure alone 
to a lesser extent  additional capital expenditures in also included installation of a long haul  high capacity microwave link to add redundancy to a critical portion of our main backbone  installation of new wireline switches and cabling to expand the geographic coverage of our wireline network in guyana 
we also expanded our dsl broadband coverage and capacity in guyana  expanded service areas and switch capabilities at our vermont location and expanded our broadband service areas and funded upgrades at choice 
acquisitions 
we have funded our recent acquisitions with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our million credit facility  which was established in september in connection with our acquisition of commnet 
on september   we acquired a equity interest in commnet for approximately million in cash  using borrowings of approximately million under the credit facility and approximately million of cash on hand 
in january  we purchased the remaining equity interest in commnet for million and  shares of our common stock in satisfaction of our obligation and in accordance with our right under and consistent with the terms of the agreement entered into in connection with our acquisition of commnet in september we funded this purchase with cash on hand and shares of our common stock 
on february   we completed the acquisition of sovernet 
in connection with the acquisition  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of sovernet for approximately million  including the repayment of approximately million in sovernet debt and the payment of transaction expenses 
at closing of the transaction  we issued shares of sovernet s common stock amounting to of sovernet s outstanding capital stock to sovernet s new chief executive  subject to vesting requirements and other restrictions 
we funded the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings on our existing credit facility see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
during  we recorded certain transactions which reduced the net purchase price from million to million and reduced the goodwill recorded in the transaction by million 
effective january   commnet completed two acquisitions of wireless roaming networks located in northeast missouri and central arizona 
commnet acquired the of mocelco  llc that it did not previously own for million in cash and all the assets of a privately held network in gila county  arizona  that it previously managed  for million in cash see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the two acquisitions consisted of a cellular license  a pcs license and gsm cell sites 
the commnet acquisitions were funded with cash on hand and borrowings on our existing revolving credit facility see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in july  and in accordance with the commnet merger agreement  commnet purchased an additional interest in commnet of florida  llc for million thus raising its ownership in commnet of florida to 
subsequent to the investment  we own of commnet of florida 
commnet of florida is consolidated for financial reporting purposes  under the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
in august  commnet acquired the remaining of one of its operating subsidiaries for million in cash 
the july and august transactions were funded with cash on hand 
we continue to explore opportunities to acquire communications properties or licenses in the caribbean  the united states and elsewhere 
such acquisitions may require external financing 
while there can be no assurance as to whether  when or on what terms we will be able to acquire any such businesses or licenses  such acquisitions may be accomplished through the issuance of shares  payment of cash or incurrence of debt 
dividends and distributions 
we use cash on hand to make dividend payments to our common stockholders when declared by our board of directors 
for the year ended december   our dividends to our stockholders approximated million which reflects dividends paid on march   june  and october  and declared in december 
we have paid quarterly dividends for the last fiscal quarters 
in addition  to the extent that we have our less than wholly owned subsidiaries pay dividends to us  we are obligated to have those subsidiaries make proportional dividend payments to the minority shareholders  and have paid dividends of million to our minority shareholders for the twelve months ended december  also  our board of directors approved a million stock buyback plan in september pursuant to which we have spent to date  repurchasing common stock 
although we currently do not intend to make additional repurchases of common stock under this plan  we may act to do so in the future  depending on market conditions and our cash needs 
debt service and other contractual commitment table 
the following table discloses aggregate information about our debt and lease obligations as of december  and the periods in which payments are due contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt including interest operating lease obligations total sources of cash total liquidity at december  as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  an increase of million from the december  balance of million 
we believe our existing cash balances and other capital resources  including the million available under our revolving line of credit included in our credit facility  are adequate to meet our current operating and capital needs 
cash generated by financing activities 
in the third quarter of  we completed the sale of million shares of common stock at per share in an underwritten public offering  consisting of the sale by us of an aggregate of million shares million shares in july and an additional million shares purchased by the underwriters as a part of their over allotment option in august and million shares by our chairman cornelius b 
prior  jr 
and related entities 
our net proceeds of this offering  which were approximately million  were used to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness  and will fund capital expenditures  acquisitions and or strategic investments and general corporate purposes 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders 
cash generated by operations 
cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  historically  gt t has been the most significant of our operating subsidiaries and affiliates in terms of our liquidity 
in  our commnet acquisition contributed the majority of the increase over in cash provided by operating activities 
credit facility 
on september   atlantic tele network entered into a credit agreement with cobank  acb providing for a credit facility consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
under the term loan  repayments of principal are deferred until the maturity of the loan on october  interest on the term loan is payable on a quarterly basis at a fixed annual interest rate of 
because cobank is a cooperative financial institution  we expect to receive patronage payments annually  and at the end of the term  from cobank which reflect our portion of cobank s profits  if any 
these payments  if received  are expected to reduce our effective interest expense on the term loan 
factors affecting sources of liquidity internally generated funds 
the key factors affecting our internally generated funds are demand for our services  competition  regulatory developments  economic conditions in the markets where we operate our businesses and industry trends within the telecommunications industry 
for a discussion of tax and regulatory risks in guyana that could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity  see business risk factors risks relating to our wireless and wireline services in guyana  regulation of our gt t subsidiary and note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
guyana us foreign currency exchange 
historically  the guyana dollar has been considerably devalued relative to the us dollar 
the current exchange rate is approximately guyana dollars to us dollar 
we use us dollars to make gt t capital expenditures  to pay certain gt t liabilities and to value our gt t assets for the purpose of making our guyanese rate of return calculation 
unfavorable changes in the guyana dollar us dollar exchange rate would reduce our purchasing power in these areas 
the continued expansion of gt t s network is dependent upon the ability of gt t to purchase equipment with us dollars 
while currently a significant portion of gt t s revenues are transacted in us dollars  this circumstance could change in the future 
as a result of the growth of gt t s local wireless and wireline operations and the general trend toward lower international settlement rates  it is likely that an increasing portion of gt t s revenues will be earned in guyanese currency 
while there are no legal restrictions on the our conversion of guyanese currency into us dollars or other hard currencies  or on the expatriation of guyanese currency or foreign currency from guyana  there are risks associated with the conversion of guyanese dollars to us dollars due to limited liquidity in the guyana foreign currency markets 
this limited liquidity has not prevented us from converting guyanese currency into us dollars within a given three month period or from converting at a price that reasonably approximates the reported exchange rate 
while we believe that gt t has  and will continue to have  adequate cash flows denominated in us currency to meet its current operating  debt service and capital requirements  there can be no assurance that gt t will be able to convert its guyana currency earnings into the us currency needed to meet such obligations 
as of december   we had no cash held in guyanese dollars 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
restrictions under credit facility 
our credit facility contains four financial tests with which atlantic tele network must comply on a consolidated basis a total leverage ratio debt to earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation amortization ebitda of to or less  a debt service coverage ratio ebitda to debt service of to or more  and an equity to assets ratio of to or more 
in addition  commnet must comply with a leverage ratio test debt of atlantic tele network and its subsidiaries  net of pledged cash  to ebitda of commnet and its subsidiaries of to  which will decrease over time to to at july  as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility 
capital markets 
our ability to raise funds in the capital markets depends on  among other things  general economic conditions  the conditions of the telecommunications industry  our financial performance and the state of the capital markets 
in june  the securities and exchange commission declared effective a universal shelf registration statement filed by the company 
this shelf registration statement registered the potential future offerings by us  from time to time of up to an aggregate of million of our securities  consisting potentially of common stock  debt securities  and other equity and convertible securities and combinations of the foregoing 
following our july equity offering which was conducted pursuant to the shelf registration statement  we have approximately million of securities registered for potential future offerings 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our consolidated operations in any of the years through critical accounting policies we have based our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap 
we periodically evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to foreign currency  revenue recognition  valuation of accounts receivable  property  plant and equipment  long lived and intangible assets  tax related accruals and contingencies 
we base our estimates on our operating experience and on various conditions existing in the market and we believe them to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the critical accounting estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the assumptions or estimates we have selected have the potential of materially impacting our financial statements 
foreign currency 
from the inception of gt t s operations through december   a significant portion of gt t s cash receipts and expenditures  including a substantial majority of its capital expenditures  have been in us dollars or other hard currencies 
accordingly  the us dollar has been gt t s functional currency and any transaction gains and losses on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities are reflected in income 
late in and early  the value of the guyana dollar declined in relation to the us dollar  resulting in foreign exchange gains 
while the decline in rates did not have a significant impact on the company s revenues or operating expenses  the decline has offset growth in gt t s wireless local exchange and outbound international long distance revenues  which are billed and paid in guyana dollars 
further declines in the value of the guyana dollar may have an adverse impact on our future operating results as growth of local currency denominated revenue continues 
as of december   million of our million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents was in guyana dollars 
with the decline in international settlement rates  the expansion of gt t s wireless business and the increases that gt t has received and hopes to receive in its rates for local service  it is possible that the guyana dollar may become gt t s functional currency in the future 
revenue recognition 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize for a particular transaction  all of the company s subsidiaries apply the criteria established by staff accounting bulletin or sab no 
revenue recognition and defer those items that do not meet the recognition criteria 
the subsidiaries also rely on their historical evidence with each customer or carrier in estimating amounts for which revenue is recognized 
however  due to the nature and timing of carrier settlements  adjustments affecting revenue can and do occur in periods subsequent to the period when the services were provided  billed and recorded as revenue 
historically  the companies accounts receivable and revenue reserves have been sufficient to absorb any credits and bad debt write offs recorded in subsequent periods 
the company s gt t subsidiary recognizes its wireless  local telephone and data and international long distance revenues when earned  regardless of the period in which they are billed 
the company applies the appropriate rate to minutes of long distance traffic based upon the foreign carrier from which that traffic is received 
however  gt t operates in a regulated industry  therefore  its pricing is subject to regulatory commission oversight 
such oversight could result in changes to the amount it bills customers in current and future periods 
gt t charges an activation fee to new wireless subscribers in guyana and re activation fees to subscribers in guyana who allow their accounts to lapse 
the company determined that the activation fees do not represent a separate unit of accounting under emerging issues task force issue no 
accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables or eitf 
accordingly  the company s policy is to defer those fees and recognize them ratably over the estimated customer relationship period in accordance with sab no 
to date  those fees have been immaterial to both gt t s and the company s financial position and results of operations for all periods presented 
the company recognizes revenue from commnet s roaming operations and other monthly fees in the period the services are provided 
sovernet recognizes revenue from subscriptions to its internet services on a monthly basis  as the services are provided regardless of the period in which they are billed 
for wireline services  sovernet recognizes such revenue as earned 
the company recognizes revenue from subscriptions to choice s internet  television and other services monthly  as the services are provided  net of management s best estimate of uncollectible accounts and regardless of the period in which they are billed 
installation fees charged by choice to customers subscribing to cable and internet services have also historically been immaterial to both choice s and the company s financial position and results of operations 
the installation fee is intended to recover a portion of the costs associated with the installation of cabling and related equipment at the customer location required for that customer to receive choice s monthly service offerings 
the company determined that choice s activation fees represent a separate unit of accounting under eitf as such  the company s policy is to recognize these fees as revenue when the services are performed 
valuation of accounts receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the ultimate realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of customers 
due to the nature and timing of carrier settlements  adjustments affecting revenue and the corresponding receivable can and do occur in periods subsequent to the period when the services were provided  billed and recorded as revenue 
historically  our accounts receivable and revenue reserves have been sufficient to absorb any credits and bad debt write offs recorded in subsequent periods 
however  the amounts we will ultimately realize upon settlement could differ in the near term from the amounts assumed in estimating these revenues and the related accounts receivable 
property  plant and equipment 
we operate in an environment where rapid changes in technology or changes in the intended use of property  plant and equipment may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
our fixed assets are recorded at cost 
repairs and replacements of minor items of property are charged to maintenance expense as incurred 
the cost of fixed assets in service and under construction includes an allocation of indirect costs applicable to construction 
we provide for depreciation using the straight line method generally between and years 
no gain or loss is recognized in connection with ordinary retirements of depreciable property 
with respect to gt t  as of january   we adopted new and generally shorter lives in connection with a tariff application filed on december  with the guyana puc 
in february  the puc accepted these lives for purposes of setting interim rates without expressly approving them  and ordered gt t not to change its depreciation rates in the future without the approval of the puc 
in june  the financial accounting standards board or fasb approved statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation and the associated asset retirement cost 
in the case of gt t we have not provided for costs related to the removal of tangible long lived assets because there are no obligations under any of our leases or under any existing or enacted laws  statutes or ordinances or elsewhere that would require us to provide for costs related to the retirement of those assets 
during  we recorded a liability in connection with sfas no 
for approximately  relating to our acquisition of commnet and increased that liability to  as of december  such accrual represents management s estimate of our obligations under certain leases to remove equipment placed on towers which are leased from third parties 
any such liability associated with choice s operations are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations or fin 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
any uncertainty about the amount and or timing of future settlement should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
we adopted fin in december there was no impact as a result of the adoption of this accounting interpretation on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we periodically review our obligations and update our cost estimates 
if laws are enacted or circumstances change  amounts required to remediate the properties may differ significantly from the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
long lived and intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying amount 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  the amount of the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset s carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value  based on management s assumptions and projections 
we assessed our long lived assets for impairment during  and determined that an impairment charge of million was required to write down the carrying amount of certain assets to their estimated fair value as these assets were identified as being excess  obsolete or carried at values that may not be recoverable due to an adverse change in the extent to which these assets were being utilized in the business  which was caused by the unfavorable business climate within the industry and continued losses in each segment 
we assessed our long lived assets for impairment during and and determined that no impairment existed 
our estimates of the future cash flows attributable to our long lived assets and the fair value of our businesses involve significant uncertainty 
those estimates are based on management s assumptions of future results  growth trends and industry conditions 
if those estimates are not met  we could have additional impairment charges in the future  and the amounts may be material 
we also assess the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis in accordance to sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the carrying value of each reporting unit  including goodwill assigned to that reporting unit  is compared to its fair value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill  an analysis is performed to determine if an impairment charge should be recorded 
we recorded a million impairment charge for goodwill at choice during we assess the recoverability of the value of our fcc licenses using a discounted cash flow valuation method 
we believe that our fcc licenses have an indefinite life based on historical ability to renew such licenses  that such renewals may be obtained indefinitely and at little cost  and that the related technology used is not expected to be replaced in the foreseeable future 
if the value of these assets was impaired by some factor  such as an adverse change in the subsidiary s operating market  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
we test the impairment of our fcc licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of fcc licenses with their carrying amount on a license by license basis 
tax related accruals 
our estimate of deferred and current income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
these reflect the assessment of actual current and future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization 
actual income tax could vary from these estimates due to future changes in tax law 
we are also subject to tax audits from various jurisdictions 
we make estimates based on the available information and consult with experts where necessary 
we believe our estimates are reasonable  however  they may change materially in the future due to new developments or interpretation 
contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  audits and other claims related to lawsuits and other legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of loss accrual required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
we consult with legal counsel and other experts where necessary in connection with our assessment of any contingencies 
the required accrual for any such contingency may change materially in the future due to new developments or changes in each matter 
we estimate these contingencies amount to approximately million at december   the majority of which are not recorded on our books 
adverse developments in these matters may result in the recording of liabilities to satisfy all or a portion of these claims 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january  the company adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  which required the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of the company s fiscal year under this transition method  stock based compensation expense recognized during includes stock options and restricted stock shares granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
and stock options and restricted stock shares granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value  estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
because the company was applying the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
prior to january  and was expensing the estimated fair value of such grants over the employees requisite service period  the adoption of sfas no 
r had no impact on the company s statements of operations for any of the years presented 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of sfas nos 
  and r sfas no 

this statement  among other things  requires that the company recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   with changes in the funded status recognized through other comprehensive income in the year in which such changes occur 
the adoption of sfas no 
had an immaterial effect on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  and no effect on the consolidated statements of operations for any period presented 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this standard is effective for periods beginning after november   therefore  the company will adopt the provisions of the standard on january  sfas permits the company to elect to measure certain of its financial instruments at either historical cost or fair value 
the company is in the process of determining what method it will choose upon adoption and  once determined  the impact  if any  adoption will have on the financial results or position of the company 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin requires that the company recognize the impact of a tax position in the company s financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective as of the beginning of the company s fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin as our material uncertain tax positions relate to interpretations and application of various income tax laws and rulings in guyana 
these matters are currently the subject of ongoing assessments and discussions between us and the government of guyana 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange sensitivity 
although a significant portion of gt t s revenues and expenditures are currently transacted in us dollars  the results of future operations nevertheless may be affected by changes in the value of the guyana dollar 
from february until early  the guyana dollar remained relatively stable at the rate of approximately to the us dollar 
in the guyana dollar declined in value to approximately to the us dollar 
it remained relatively stable at approximately that rate through from december   through december  the guyana dollar further declined in value to approximately to the us dollar and it remained relatively stable until late in the fourth quarter  the guyana dollar declined in value to approximately to the us dollar and to approximately during the first quarter of the effect of the devaluation of the guyana dollar on our consolidated financial results has not been significant in the periods presented 
however  the recent declines in and resulted in the recording of a million foreign exchange gain at december  and a  gain in the first quarter of as the devaluation decreased the value of gt t s guyana dollar net liabilities resulting in a gain 
the gain in was substantially offset by other foreign exchange losses incurred during the year  we did not incur similar losses during  or a substantial majority of our consolidated cash balances are kept in us dollar denominated short term investments  and gt t generally endeavors to maintain a balance between its guyana dollar cash deposits and local receivables which are denominated in guyana dollars  and its local tax and other payables which are also denominated in the guyana dollar 
under generally accepted international accounting principles  which  in our view  are statutorily applicable to the rate making process in guyana  gt t s functional currency has been the us dollar because a significant portion of gt t s revenues and expenditures have been transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  in our view  gt t is currently entitled to its agreed upon minimum return on rate base computed in us dollars on a us dollar historical cost rate base and therefore devaluations of the guyana dollar should have had no long term impact on the value of gt t s earnings in us dollars 
the guyana public utility commission has neither approved nor disapproved our position 
moreover  with the decline in international settlement rates and the increases that gt t hopes to have in local revenue  the guyana dollar may become gt t s functional currency at some time in the future
