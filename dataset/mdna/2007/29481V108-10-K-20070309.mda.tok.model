overview we were founded in to provide cardiac safety services to evaluate the safety of new drugs 
we provide technology and services that enable the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries to collect  interpret and distribute cardiac safety and clinical data more efficiently 
we are a market leader in providing centralized electrocardiographic services cardiac safety services or expert ecg services and a leading provider of technology and services that streamline the clinical trials process by enabling our clients to evolve from traditional  paper based methods to electronic processing using our eclinical products and services 
our solutions improve the accuracy  timeliness and efficiency of trial set up  data collection from sites worldwide  data interpretation  and new drug  biologic and device application submissions 
we offer cardiac safety services  which are utilized by clinical trial sponsors and clinical research organizations cros during the conduct of clinical trials and measure the interval between the start of the q wave and the end of the t wave in the heart s electrical cycle  adjusted for heart rate 
thorough qtc studies are comprehensive studies that typically are of large volume and of short duration  with ecgs performed over a two to six month period 
the digital ecg franchise program was designed to address the capacity demands for ert s ecg services through partnerships with sponsors that desired dedicated resources within ert to address specific levels of cardiac safety monitoring transactions 
we have decided to discontinue the offering of the digital ecg franchise program as we feel we can offer our clients a better value proposition in other ways in the current operating environment 
we also offer site support  which includes the rental and sale of cardiac safety equipment along with related supplies and freight 
additionally  we offer the licensing and  at the client s option  hosting of our proprietary eclinical software products and the provision of maintenance and consulting services in support of our proprietary eclinical software products 
our license revenues consist of license fees for perpetual license sales and monthly and annual term license sales 
our services revenues consist of cardiac safety services  technology consulting and training services and 
table of contents software maintenance services 
our site support revenue consists of cardiac safety equipment rentals and sales along with related supplies and freight 
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and  if so  how the contract value should be allocated among the deliverable elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known  uncertainties regarding client acceptance are resolved and there are no client negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements 
cost of licenses consists primarily of application service provider asp fees for those clients that choose hosting  the cost of producing compact disks and related documentation and royalties paid to third parties in connection with their contributions to our product development 
cost of services includes the cost of cardiac safety services and the cost of technology consulting  training and maintenance services 
cost of cardiac safety services consists primarily of direct costs related to our centralized cardiac safety services and includes wages  depreciation and other direct operating costs 
cost of technology consulting  training and maintenance services consists primarily of wages  fees paid to outside consultants and other direct operating costs related to our consulting and client support functions 
cost of site support consists primarily of wages  cardiac safety equipment rent and depreciation  related supplies  cost of equipment sold  shipping expenses and other direct operating costs 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of wages and commissions paid to sales personnel  travel expenses and advertising and promotional expenditures 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and direct costs for our finance  administrative  corporate information technology  legal and executive management functions  in addition to professional service fees and corporate insurance 
research and development expenses consist primarily of wages paid to our product development staff  costs paid to outside consultants and direct costs associated with the development of our technology products 
we conduct our operations through offices in the united states us and the united kingdom uk 
our international net revenues represented approximately  and of total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the majority of our revenues are allocated among our geographic segments based upon the profit split transfer pricing methodology  and revenues are generally attributed to the geographic segment where the work is performed 
the international net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues reflect the application of the change in transfer pricing methodology  which we implemented in the third quarter of  as if the changes were in effect as of january  results of operations executive overview was a year of considerable change for our company 
we hired a new chief financial officer in april to replace the retiring prior chief financial officer 
in june  we hired a new chief executive officer and president to replace the prior chief executive officer and president  who had announced his retirement in february of the year was also characterized by ongoing changes in our external environment 
the impact of regulatory guidance approved in  relating to rigorous cardiac safety testing in healthy volunteers thorough qtc studies  worked its way through the drug development process of many of our clients during the year 
technology and process changes impacted pricing in our marketplace and placed strains on our margins 
new competitors entered the industry  putting further pressure on prices and services 
the change in the mix of our products  which had started in  continued the shift in the cardiac safety process from a manual form higher selling price of processing to a semi automated process lower selling price 
during the year  the company responded to these changes 
to address changes in the regulatory environment  we increased our focus on our clients key decision makers by adopting a more senior level consultative sales approach with our clients to respond to the regulatory changes 
we enhanced our technological platforms to meet 
table of contents the new marketplace demands by completing our new patented cardiac safety workflow processing system expert this system will allow us to more efficiently process ecgs and to adapt to evolving needs of our clients 
we proactively restructured our organization to align with the changing pricing and process environment so that we could address the shift to the lower priced semi automated method of analysis and the increased competitive environment 
on february   we announced that the effect of this and the related efficiency improvements in cardiac safety operations and general and administrative cost structure during will be minimal  as severance and other transitional costs will largely offset efficiency savings 
the overall effect on earnings per diluted share should be approximately for the full year in our company s sales for were million as compared to sales of million for this flat  year to year result was due to the increased competition in the market place as well as the shift in our product sales to the lower cost semi automated process 
the shift in business to a lower priced product also impacted our gross margins  which resulted in a gross margin of million as compared to million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
our operating income was reduced by stock option compensation expense recognized as a result of the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which occurred at the outset of the year  transition costs relating to changes in executive management and costs associated with the settlement of a contract dispute of million  million and million  respectively 
these items contributed to a reduction of diluted net income per share to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the following table presents certain financial data as a percentage of total net revenues year ended december  net revenues licenses services site support total net revenues costs of revenues cost of licenses cost of services cost of site support total costs of revenues gross margin operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative research and development total operating expenses operating income other income  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income

table of contents the following table presents costs of revenues as a percentage of related net revenues and operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues year ended december  increase decrease cost of licenses cost of services cardiac safety technology consulting and training software maintenance total cost of services cost of site support total costs of revenues operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative research and development license revenues decreased primarily due to a decline in the number of licenses sold  which resulted in a decrease in revenue of million  conversions of subscription licenses to perpetual licenses in and terminations of subscription licenses in the decrease in cardiac safety service revenues was primarily due to a decrease in average revenue per transaction that was largely due to the impact of increased activity in semi automated processing  which generally includes lower fees per transaction than other studies  as well as competitive pricing pressure 
these decreases were partially offset by the recognition of million of deferred revenues that remained upon the termination of a digital ecg franchise agreement at the end of august the increase in technology consulting and training revenues was primarily related to million of professional services performed in connection with license sales as well as a million increase in consulting revenue from eclinical clients related to protocol set up work 
many of the license sales in required limited consulting services due to the nature of the licenses sold 
software maintenance revenues decreased due to the cancellation of maintenance agreements and the settlement of a contract dispute which resulted in our providing software maintenance to one customer at no charge for a four year period beginning august   which resulted in a decrease in software maintenance revenue of million in as compared to these declines were partially offset by maintenance on several new software licenses sold during and site support revenue increased primarily due to a million increase in the sale of cardiac safety equipment in as compared to our clients use cardiac safety equipment to perform cardiac safety procedures 
the increase was also due to a million increase in the rental of cardiac safety equipment in as compared to  as well as an increase in freight revenue due to additional shipments 
the decrease in cost of licenses was primarily due to a reduction in third party asp hosting fees and software license and maintenance costs 
the increase in cost of licenses as a percentage of license revenues was due to the decrease in perpetual license revenues which have very little incremental cost of sales  such that revenue reductions lead to minimal cost savings 
the increase in the cost of cardiac safety services  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of cardiac safety revenues  was primarily due to unanticipated charges for services previously provided of million  million of stock option compensation expense in related to the adoption of sfas no 
r  increased labor costs of million including payroll taxes related to option exercises and increased facilities costs of million due to a rent increase associated with a lease extension 
additional increases occurred for utilities  
table of contents costs associated with an offsite computer hosting facility and increased software license and maintenance costs 
these increases were partially offset by the initial costs of million associated with a move to a new facility in the uk in  a decrease of million in bonuses as no bonus expense was recognized in while bonus expense was recognized under a six month bonus plan in the second half of  lower depreciation expense of million related to a one time adjustment in for leasehold improvements and certain components of our data and communications management services software product expert  which became fully depreciated in the third quarter of the increase in the cost of cardiac safety services as a percentage of cardiac safety service revenues was also due to the fact that some of the costs do not necessarily change in direct relation with changes in revenue 
the increase in the cost of technology consulting and training services was primarily due to higher third party consulting costs required to accommodate the increased workload associated with the increase in revenue 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in bonuses as no bonus expense was recognized in while bonus expense was recognized under a six month bonus plan in the second half of the decrease in the cost of technology consulting and training services as a percentage of technology consulting and training service revenues was due to the fact that some of the costs do not necessarily increase or decrease in direct relation with changes in revenue 
the increase in the cost of site support  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of site support revenues  was due primarily to an increase in the cost of sales of equipment of million and million of depreciation costs associated with cardiac safety rental equipment as well as increased freight costs of million 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net revenues  was primarily due to million of stock option compensation expense recognized in related to the adoption of sfas no 
r  increases in compensation expense of million predominately related to salaries of new personnel and million of higher bonus expense due to better bookings compared to targets 
the increase was also due to increased software licenses and maintenance costs and higher tradeshow costs 
the increase in general and administrative expenses  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net revenues  was due primarily to million of costs associated with the settlement of a contract dispute  stock option compensation expense and costs associated with management changes 
excluding these costs  cost increases of million for compensation and other costs were more than offset by decreases due to a reduction in the cost of consultants related to internal control work required by the sarbanes oxley act  legal fees and certain non income taxes 
other income  net  consisted primarily of interest income realized from our cash  cash equivalents and investments  net of impairment charges in and related to a cost basis investment  interest expense related to capital lease obligations and foreign exchange losses 
other income  net increased primarily due to a reduction in foreign exchange losses and increased interest income due to higher interest rates in our effective tax rate was and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the primary cause of the increase in the effective tax rate was stock option compensation expense in  which is not fully deductible for tax purposes 
partially offsetting this increase to the effective tax rate was an increase in tax free interest income in additionally  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  included a net income tax benefit of approximately million related to the recovery of prior year state taxes due to a change in our transfer pricing methodology

table of contents the following table presents costs of revenues as a percentage of related net revenues and operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues year ended december  increase decrease cost of licenses cost of services cardiac safety technology consulting and training software maintenance total cost of services cost of site support total costs of revenues operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative research and development license revenues decreased primarily due to a decline in the number of licenses sold and a decrease in the average license revenue for each license sold  which together resulted in a decrease in license revenue of million 
the decrease in the average license revenue was largely the result of a change in the mix of the type of licenses sold and the number of users for each license 
the decrease in cardiac safety service revenues was primarily due to a decrease in transactions performed and a decrease in average revenue per transaction 
the decrease in sales volume in was partially attributable to a slowdown in contract signings in the second half of and the first half of  delays in certain studies as well as a decrease in comprehensive thorough qtc studies 
thorough qtc studies are typically of large volume and of short duration  with ecgs performed over a two to six month period 
as a result  revenues resulting from thorough qtc studies are more difficult to predict 
we believe that regulatory uncertainty delayed new contract signings and extended the time for initiation of new studies 
the decrease in average revenue per transaction was largely due to the impact of increased activity for digital ecg franchise accounts and semi automated processing  which generally include lower fees per transaction than other studies  as well as competitive pricing adjustments 
technology consulting and training revenues decreased primarily due to a reduction in consulting and configuration for eclinical software products 
many of the license sales in required limited consulting services due to the nature of the licenses sold 
software maintenance revenues increased due to software licenses sold during and after  which increased the number of total active licenses and their related maintenance fees 
site support revenue decreased primarily due to a decrease of million in the sale of cardiac safety equipment included an unusually large sale transaction and a million decrease in revenue from the rental of cardiac safety equipment  which our clients use to perform cardiac safety procedures 
the decline in rental revenue was driven largely by a reduction in the average revenue per equipment unit due to competitive pricing in the cardiac safety services market 
the decrease in cost of licenses was primarily due to a royalty paid in to a third party software developer related to the sale of one of the perpetual licenses as well as a decrease in asp hosting fees 
the increase in the cost of cardiac safety services  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of cardiac safety revenues  was primarily due to an increase in labor of million  depreciation of million and increased facilities of million and other costs associated with expanding capabilities to meet the past and expected future growth in cardiac safety service revenues 
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in amortization expense related to internal use software costs of million  a reduction in incentive bonuses of 
table of contents million due to higher targets set for the first half of that were not achieved and a reduction in recruitment expenses of million 
additionally  the increase in the cost of cardiac safety services as a percentage of cardiac safety service revenues was due to the fact that some of the costs do not necessarily increase or decrease in direct relation with changes in revenue 
the decrease in the cost of technology consulting and training services was primarily due to a reduction in incentive bonuses due to higher targets set for the first half of that were unmet  a reduction in third party consulting costs that was partially attributable to the decrease in related revenue  higher employee benefits costs in in connection with stock option exercises and a decrease in other labor costs 
the increase in the cost of technology consulting and training services as a percentage of technology consulting and training service revenues was due to the fact that some of the costs do not necessarily increase or decrease in direct relation with changes in revenue 
the increase in the cost of site support  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of site support revenues  was due primarily to an increase of million in depreciation expense and million of rental costs associated with cardiac safety rental equipment and other costs associated with expanding capabilities to meet the past and expected growth in site support activities  including the addition of new dedicated site support facilities in both the us and uk during the second half of the increase in the cost of site support as a percentage of site support revenues was also due to the fact that some of the costs do not necessarily increase or decrease in direct relation with changes in revenue 
the decrease in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to million of lower commissions that resulted from a decrease in commissionable revenue and the conversion of certain business development directors from incentive compensation based upon commission to incentive compensation based upon bonus 
in the second half of  performance against bonus targets improved which resulted in an increase in bonus expense of million  which partially offset the commission expense reduction 
additionally  labor cost increases of million in partially offset the commission expense reduction 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was due to maintaining other selling and marketing expenditures  including labor  despite the decrease in total net revenues 
the increase in general and administrative expenses  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net revenues  was due primarily to higher labor costs of million due to new hires  a million increase in charitable contributions in  and increases in professional fees of million 
additionally  the increase was due to higher board fees  depreciation  equipment  insurance and telephone expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in incentive bonuses due to higher targets in the first half of that were not achieved as well as lower audit fees due to the high cost of the initial attestation work in on internal controls in accordance with the sarbanes oxley act 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was also due to the decrease in net revenues and the fact that general and administrative expenses do not necessarily increase or decrease in direct relation with changes in revenues 
other income  net  consisted primarily of interest income realized from our cash  cash equivalents and investments as well as foreign exchange gains  net of interest expense related to capital lease obligations  foreign exchange losses and an impairment charge in related to a cost basis investment 
other income  net increased primarily due to a shift to higher yielding money market investments and a decrease in interest expense related to capital leases in these increases were partially offset by foreign exchange losses in as well as an impairment charge of million in the first quarter of our effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  included a net income tax benefit of approximately million related to the recovery of prior year state taxes due to a change in our transfer pricing methodology 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million invested in short term and long term investments 
we generally place our investments in municipal securities  bonds of government 
table of contents sponsored agencies  certificates of deposit with fixed rates and maturities of less than one year  and ap rated commercial bonds and paper 
for the year ended december   our operations provided cash of million compared to million during the year ended december  the change was primarily the result of a decrease of million in net income partially offset by an increase of million in the non cash impact of the cost of sales of equipment 
additionally  operating assets and liabilities used million more cash in as compared to  primarily due to an increase in prepaid income taxes of million and accounts receivable of million and a decrease in accrued expenses of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of million 
prepaid income taxes increased as a result of estimated payments made in excess of expected tax liabilities for the year ended december  the increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of the expiration of a digital ecg franchise agreement and the resulting change in the timing of payments as compared to work performed 
the decrease in accrued expenses was primarily the result of a decrease in bonuses due at the end of as compared to as well as a decrease in professional fees due at the end of as compared to the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to an accrual for unanticipated charges for services previously provided 
there was also a million increase to cash provided by operations in due to the inclusion of the non cash impact of share based compensation as compared to a million increase in cash provided by operations in due to a change in the presentation of the tax benefits related to stock options from operating to financing activities as stipulated by sfas no

included in property and equipment is internal use software associated with the development of a data and communications management services software product expert used in connection with our centralized core cardiac safety ecg services 
we capitalize certain internal use software costs in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for costs of computer software for internal use 
the amortization is charged to the cost of cardiac safety services beginning at the time the software is ready for its intended use 
the initial development costs of expert were for the basic functionality required for this product 
additional development costs of expert were incurred to develop new functionalities and enhancements 
we started a new internal use software project to allow for semi automated processing of ecgs in the second quarter of and further enhancements were begun in october we also began capitalizing costs associated with an upgrade to expert expert beginning in the fourth quarter of in april  we began developing enhancements to expert which were necessary while expert was being developed 
in mid august of  we revised our estimated timing for the completion of the expert development work to the end of the fourth quarter of  as opposed to the first quarter of as we previously had estimated 
as this upgrade has replaced many parts of the existing expert product  we previously had accelerated the amortization of capitalized labor and consulting costs to fully amortize the associated costs of the existing expert product by the end of the first quarter of  which increased monthly amortization expense by  beginning in the fourth quarter of beginning in mid august of  we revised the remaining amortization period for previously capitalized labor and consulting costs to fully amortize the associated costs of the existing expert product by the end of the fourth quarter of  which decreased monthly amortization expense by  beginning in mid august at the beginning of april  we extended the remaining life of the existing expert product to co exist with expert and extended the depreciation period through august this resulted in a decrease in monthly amortization expense of  beginning in april expert was placed into production in january in the first quarter of  we began development of a data warehouse that enables centralized capture of cardiac safety data and the ability to integrate with the food and drug administration s ecg data warehouse 
the data warehouse was placed into production in january

in prior years  the tax benefit related to stock options was included in operating activities 
we have a line of credit arrangement with wachovia bank  national association totaling million  through june   which we currently expect to renew upon expiration 
to date  we have not borrowed any amounts under our line of credit 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million  which reduced our available borrowings under the line of credit to million 
we have a commitment to purchase approximately million of private label cardiac safety equipment from a manufacturer over the twelve month period ending in july this cardiac safety equipment is expected to be purchased in the normal course of business and thus does not represent a significant commitment above our expected purchases of ecg equipment during that period 
as of december   approximately million of equipment was purchased under the commitment 
we expect that existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next year 
however  there may be acquisition and other growth opportunities that require additional external financing and we may from time to time seek to obtain additional funds from the public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that any such acquisitions will occur or that such financings will be available or available on terms acceptable to us 
in the second quarter of  the stock buy back program that was originally announced in april and extended to million shares in october was extended by an additional million shares to a total of million shares 
the purchase of the remaining shares authorized could require us to use a significant portion of our cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments and could also require us to seek additional external financing 
the stock buy back authorization allows us  but does not require us  to purchase the authorized shares 
during the year ended december   we purchased  shares of our common stock at a cost of million  all of which were purchased in the three months ended march

critical accounting policies in december and december  the sec issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the following are our critical accounting policies 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenues primarily from three sources license fees  services and site support 
our license revenues consist of license fees for perpetual license sales and monthly and annual term license sales 
our services revenues consist of cardiac safety services  technology consulting and training services and software maintenance services 
our site support revenues consist of cardiac safety equipment rentals and sales along with related supplies and freight 
we recognize software revenues in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
accordingly  we recognize up front license fee revenues under the residual method when a formal agreement exists  delivery of the software and related documentation has occurred  collectability is probable and the license fee is fixed or determinable 
we recognize monthly and annual term license fee revenues over the term of the arrangement 
hosting service fees are recognized evenly over the term of the service 
cardiac safety services revenues consist of services that we provide on a fee for services basis and are recognized as the services are performed 
site support revenues are recognized at the time of sale or over the rental period 
we recognize revenues from software maintenance contracts on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance contract  which is typically twelve months 
we provide consulting and training services on a time and materials basis and recognize revenues as we perform the services 
at the time of the transaction  management assesses whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
the assessment of whether the fee is fixed or determinable is based upon the payment terms of the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms or upon implementation or client acceptance  the fee is accounted for as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  revenue is recognized as the fees become due or after implementation or client acceptance has occurred 
collectability is assessed based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the client and the creditworthiness of the client 
if it is determined that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  the fee is deferred and revenue is recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
under a typical contract for cardiac safety services  clients pay us a portion of our fee for these services upon contract execution as an upfront deposit  some of which is typically nonrefundable upon contract termination 
revenues are then recognized under cardiac safety service contracts as the services are performed 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of each element is known  the revenue is allocated to each component based on the relative fair values of each element 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of one or more delivered elements is not known  revenue is allocated to each component of the arrangement using the residual method provided that the fair value of all undelivered elements is known 
fair values for undelivered elements are based primarily upon stated renewal rates for future products or services 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management having to estimate our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
management must then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent management establishes or increases a valuation allowance in a period  the consolidated statement of operations will reflect additional income tax expense 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of million related to the uncertain realization of certain deferred tax assets 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

table of contents depreciation and amortization of long lived assets we compute depreciation on our property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which generally range from two to five years 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term 
system development costs are amortized on a straight line basis over four or five years or  in the case of enhancements which have no stand alone use  the remaining life of the initial project 
changes in the estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment could have a material effect on our results of operations 
stock based compensation we follow the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of options using the black scholes option pricing model with assumptions based primarily on historical data 
the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model require estimates of the expected term the stock based awards are held until exercised  the estimated volatility of our stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements 
changes in our assumptions may impact the expenses related to our stock options 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which begin on page f of this form k  for a description of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary financial market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk we generally place our investments in money market funds  municipal securities  bonds of government sponsored agencies  certificates of deposit with fixed rates with maturities of less than one year  and ap rated commercial bonds and paper 
we actively manage our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  but in order to ensure liquidity  we will only invest in instruments with high credit quality where a secondary market exists 
we have not held and do not hold any derivatives related to our interest rate exposure 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that had the average yield of our investments decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately million 
this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments 
see liquidity and capital resources as part of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
foreign currency risk we operate on a global basis from locations in the united states and the united kingdom 
all international net revenues and expenses are billed or incurred in either us dollars or pounds sterling 
as such  we face exposure to adverse movements in the exchange rate of the pound sterling 
as the currency rate changes  translation of the statement of operations of our uk subsidiary from the local currency to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
we do not hedge translation risks because any cash flows from uk operations are generally reinvested in the uk 
management estimates that a change in the exchange rate of the pound sterling would have impacted the reported operating income for the year ended december  by less than million
