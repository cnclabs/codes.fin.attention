item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations a 
overview with the exception of certain research funding agreements and certain grants  we have not generated any revenue from operations 
for the period from the date of our inception  october   to march   we incurred cumulative net losses of approximately  we have incurred additional operating losses since march  and expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we expect that our cash sources for at least the next year will be limited to o payments from unc ch  charitable foundations and other research collaborators under arrangements that may be entered into in the future  o research grants  such as small business innovation research sbir grants  and o sales of equity securities or borrowing funds 
the timing and amounts of grant and other revenues  if any  will likely fluctuate sharply and depend upon the achievement of specified milestones 
our results of operations for any period may be unrelated to the results of operations for any other period 
b 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report of form k 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the fair value of our preferred stock and common stock and related options and warrants  the recognition of revenues and costs related to our research contracts  and the useful lives or impairment of our property and equipment 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
grants to perform research are our primary source of revenue and are generally granted to support research and development activities for specific projects or drug candidates 
revenue related to grants to perform research and development is recognized as earned  based on the performance requirements of the specific grant 
prepaid cash payments from research and development grants are reported as deferred revenue until such time as the research and development activities covered by the grant are performed 
effective april   we adopted sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
that cost  based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest  will be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide the service in exchange for the award 
no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service 
upon adoption  the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments was estimated using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes valuation requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based award and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used are management s best estimates  but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  the recorded and pro forma stock based compensation expense could have been materially different from that depicted in the financial statements 
we believe that the accounting policies affecting these estimates are our critical accounting policies 
c 
research and development expenses all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses include  but are not limited to  payroll and personnel expenses  lab supplies  preclinical studies  raw materials to manufacture clinical trial drugs  manufacturing costs  sponsored research at other labs  consulting and research related overhead

specific information pertaining to amounts spent directly on each of our major research and development projects follows

all of our research and development projects contain high levels of risk 
even if development is completed on schedule  there is no guarantee that any of our products will be licensed for sale 
human trials conducted in foreign and developing countries have additional risks  including governmental instability and local militia uprisings that may interrupt or displace our work
