overview we are a managed care organization that focuses primarily on medicare  the health insurance program for retired united states citizens aged and older  qualifying disabled persons  and persons suffering from end stage renal disease 
medicare is funded by the federal government and administered by cms 
as of december   we owned and operated medicare health plans  including stand alone prescription drug plans  in tennessee  texas  alabama  illinois  and mississippi 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenue consisted of premiums we received from cms pursuant to our medicare contracts 
although we concentrate on medicare plans  we also utilize our infrastructure and provider networks in tennessee and alabama to offer commercial health plans to employer groups 
we expect revenue from our medicare business will continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenue in as our medicare business grows and our commercial business contracts 
on january   we began offering prescription drug benefits in accordance with medicare part d to our medicare advantage plan members  in addition to continuing to provide other medical benefits 
we sometimes refer to these plans after january  collectively as medicare advantage plans and separately as ma only in other words  without prescription drug benefits and ma pd with prescription drug benefits plans 
on january   we also began offering prescription drug benefits on a stand alone basis in accordance with medicare part d 
we refer to these as stand alone pdp or pdp plans 
for purposes of additional analysis  the company provides membership and certain financial information  including premium revenue and medical expense  for our medicare advantage including ma pd and pdp plans 
effective january   we began operation as a national pdp plan 
as of january   approximately of our pdp members were located in our five current medicare advantage markets 
highlights medicare advantage membership in increased over the prior year 
total revenue for was billion  an increase of over combined results 
medicare advantage including ma pd premiums were billion for  reflecting an increase of over the prior year 
stand alone pdp premiums were million 
medicare advantage medical loss ratio mlr was for and pdp mlr was 
net cash provided by operating activities for was million  or times net income 

table of contents total cash at december  was million  including cash of million held at unregulated subsidiaries 
in february  we completed our initial public offering  or ipo  of common stock 
in the ipo  we issued million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we used the net proceeds of the ipo of approximately million to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness  including accrued and unpaid interest and other expenses related to the ipo 
in connection with the ipo  the minority interests in our texas hmo subsidiary were exchanged for  shares of common stock 
in addition  as a result of the ipo  all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock and accrued but unpaid dividends automatically converted into shares of common stock at the ipo price 
on october   we completed a secondary public offering of our common stock 
in connection with the secondary offering certain stockholders of the company  including funds affiliated with gtcr golder rauner  llc  or the gtcr funds  sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares in the secondary offering 
basis of presentation the recapitalization healthspring  inc was formed in october in connection with a recapitalization transaction  which was accounted for using the purchase method  involving our predecessor  newquest  llc  its members  the gtcr funds  and certain other investors and lenders 
the recapitalization was completed on march  in connection with the recapitalization  the company  newquest  llc  its members  the gtcr funds  and certain other investors entered into a purchase and exchange agreement and other related agreements pursuant to which the gtcr funds and certain other investors purchased shares of our preferred stock and common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in addition  upon the closing of the recapitalization  the company issued shares of restricted common stock to employees of the company for an aggregate purchase price of  the company used the proceeds from the sale of preferred and common stock and million of borrowings under our senior credit facility and senior subordinated notes to fund million in cash payments to the members of newquest  llc and to pay expenses and other payments relating to the transaction 
prior to the recapitalization  approximately of the ownership interests in two of our tennessee management subsidiaries and approximately of the membership interests of our texas hmo subsidiary  texas healthspring  llc  were owned by outside investors 
contemporaneously with the recapitalization  we purchased all of the minority interests in our tennessee subsidiaries for an aggregate consideration of approximately million and a portion of the membership interests held by the minority investors in texas healthspring  llc for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
following the purchase  the outside investors in texas healthspring  llc owned an approximately ownership interest 
in june  texas healthspring completed a private placement pursuant to which it issued new membership interests to existing and new investors  primarily physicians affiliated with rpo  for net proceeds of million 
following this private placement  and as of december   the outside investors owned an approximately interest in texas healthspring  llc  which interest was automatically exchanged  without additional consideration  for  shares of our common stock immediately prior to the ipo 
for purposes of comparing our twelve month results with the comparable and periods  we have combined the results of operations of the predecessor from january  through february  and of the company for the period from march  through december  this combined presentation is not in accordance with gaap  however  we believe it is useful in analyzing and comparing certain of our operating trends for the last three fiscal years 
the combined and consolidated results of operations include the accounts of healthspring  inc and all of its subsidiaries 
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
revenue general 
our revenue consists primarily of i premium revenue we generate from our medicare and commercial lines of business  ii fee revenue we receive for management and administrative services provided to 
table of contents independent physician associations  health plans  and self insured employers  and for access to our provider networks  and iii investment income 
premium revenue 
our medicare and commercial lines of business include all premium revenue we receive in our health plans 
our medicare contracts entitle us to premium payments from cms  on behalf of each medicare beneficiary enrolled in our plans  generally on a per member per month  or pmpm  basis 
in our commercial hmos  we receive a monthly payment from or on behalf of each enrolled member 
in both our commercial and medicare plans  we recognize premium revenue during the month in which the company is obligated to provide services to an enrolled member 
premiums we receive in advance of that date are recorded as deferred revenue 
premiums for our medicare and commercial products are generally fixed by contract in advance of the period during which health care is covered 
each of our medicare plans submits rate proposals to cms  generally by county or service area  in june for each medicare product that will be offered beginning january of the subsequent year 
retroactive rate adjustments are made periodically with respect to each of our medicare plans based on the aggregate health status and risk scores of our plan populations 
during and these rate adjustments were recorded as received 
effective january   the company began recording estimated risk payment adjustments on a monthly basis and will adjust the estimated amounts to actual when the ultimate adjustments are received from cms 
our commercial premiums are generally fixed for the plan year  in most cases beginning january as with our traditional medicare advantage plans  we provide written bids to cms for our part d plans  which include the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year 
premium payments from cms are based on these estimated costs 
the amount of cms payments relating to the part d standard coverage for our ma pd and pdp plans is subject to adjustment  positive or negative  based upon the application of risk corridors that compare our prescription drug costs in our bids to cms to our actual prescription drug costs 
variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or our refunding to cms a portion of the premium payments we previously received 
we estimate and recognize adjustments to premium revenue related to estimated risk corridor payments as of each quarter end based upon our actual prescription drug costs for each reporting period as if the annual contract were to end at the end of each reporting period 
actual risk corridor payments upon final settlement with cms could differ materially  favorably or unfavorably  from our estimates 
because of the part d product benefit design  the company incurs prescription drug costs unevenly throughout the year  resulting in fluctuations in quarterly ma pd and pdp earnings 
as a result of product features such as co payments and deductibles  the coverage gap sometimes referred to as the donut hole  risk corridors  and reinsurance  we incur a disproportionate amount of prescription drug costs in the first half of the year 
as a result  our part d related earnings increase in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year 
certain part d related payments we receive from cms represent payments for claims that we pay on behalf of cms for which we assume no risk  including reinsurance and low income costs subsidies 
we account for these subsidies as funds held for the benefit of members on our balance sheet and as a financing activity in our statement of cash flows 
we do not recognize premium revenue or claims expense for these subsidies as these amounts represent pass through payments from cms to fund deductibles  co payments  and other member benefits 
we recognize prescription drug costs as incurred  net of rebates from drug companies 
fee revenue 
fee revenue primarily includes amounts paid to us for management services provided to independent physician associations and health plans 
our management subsidiaries typically generate fee revenue on one of three bases as a percentage of revenue collected by the relevant health plan  as a fixed pmpm payment or percentage of revenue for members serviced by the relevant independent physician association  or as fees we receive for offering access to our provider networks and for administrative services we offer to self insured employers 
fee revenue is recognized in the month in which services are provided 
in addition  pursuant to certain of our management agreements with independent physician associations  or ipa s  we receive fees based on a share of the profits of the independent physician associations 
to the extent these fees relate to members of our hmo subsidiaries  the fees are recognized as a credit to medical expense 
management fees calculated based on profits are recognized  as fee revenue or as a credit to medical expenses  if applicable  when we can readily determine that such fees have been earned  which determination is typically made on a monthly basis 
investment income 
investment income consists of interest income and gross realized gains and losses from sales of available for sale investments 

table of contents medical expense our largest expense is the cost of medical services we arrange for our members  or medical expense 
medical expense for our medicare and commercial plans primarily consist of payments to physicians  hospitals  pharmacies  and other health care providers for services and products provided to our medicare and commercial members 
we generally pay our providers on one of three bases fee for service contracts based on negotiated fee schedules  capitated arrangements  generally on a fixed pmpm payment basis  whereby the provider generally assumes some or all of the medical expense risk  and risk sharing arrangements  whereby we advance a capitated pmpm amount and share the risk of the medical costs of our members with the provider based on actual experience as measured against pre determined sharing ratios 
pharmacy cost represents payments for member s prescription drug benefits  net of rebates from drug manufacturers 
rebates are recognized when earned  according to the contractual arrangements with the respective manufacturers 
one of our primary tools for managing our business and measuring our profitability is our medical loss ratio  or mlr  the ratio of our medical expenses to the premiums we receive 
relatively small changes in the ratio of our medical expenses relative to the premium we receive can result in significant changes in our financial results 
changes in the mlr from period to period result from  among other things  changes in medicare funding or commercial premiums  changes in benefits offered by our plans  our ability to manage medical expense  changes in accounting estimates related to incurred but not reported  or ibnr  claims  and our part d related earnings relative to cms risk corridors 
we use mlrs both to monitor our management of medical expenses and to make various business decisions  including what plans or benefits to offer  what geographic areas to enter or exit  and our selection of healthcare providers 
we analyze and evaluate our medicare and commercial mlrs separately

we anticipate that our current level of cash on hand  internally generated cash flows  and borrowings available under our senior secured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and anticipated capital expenditures over the next twelve months 
the reported changes in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december   and  are summarized below year ended december  in thousands combined net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents the change in cash and cash equivalents for the combined twelve month period ended december  above includes our predecessor for the period from january  through february  and the company for the period from march  through december  the investing and financing activities were significantly affected by the recapitalization 
cash flows from operating activities our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow provided by our operations  available cash on hand and our revolving credit facility 
we generated cash from operating activities of million during the year ended december   compared to during the year ended december  our cash flows are significantly influenced by the timing of the medicare premium remittance from cms  which is payable to us on the first day of each month 
this payment is sometimes received in the last several days of the month prior to the month of medical coverage 
when this happens  we record the receipt in deferred revenue and 
table of contents recognize it as premium revenue in the month of medical coverage 
the january payment in the amount of million was received in december of  which had the effect of increasing operating cash flows in with a corresponding decrease in adjusting our operating cash flows in for the effect of the timing of this payment  our operating cash flows would have been as follows year ended december  in thousands combined net cash provided by operating activities  as reported timing effect of cms payment adjusted cash flow compared with the increase in adjusted cash flow provided by operating activities to million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the combined twelve months ended december  is primarily attributable to increases in medicare advantage membership and premiums and earnings from part d as of january  in addition  the following working capital items had a significant impact on cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  risk corridor payable to cms associated with the part d drug program increased million in the current year 
medical claims liability increased million in the current year as a result of the increase in medicare advantage including ma pd member months 
net income has been reduced as a result of depreciation and amortization in the amount of million  stock compensation of million  the write off of deferred financing fees of million and minority interest of  all of which represented non cash items 
compared with the increase in adjusted cash flow provided by operating activities to million for the combined twelve months ended december  as compared with million for  as adjusted  is primarily attributable to increases in membership and premiums 
for the combined twelve months of  we generated million of net income and increased working capital by million 
net income had been reduced as a result of depreciation and amortization in the amount of million  and minority interest of million  all of which represented non cash items 
cash flows from investing and financing activities for the year ended december   the primary investing activities consisted of million in property and equipment additions  approximately million used to purchase investments  and million in proceeds from the sale and maturity of investment securities 
the company expects capital expenditures in to be at or below of total revenues 
our ongoing capital expenditures are primarily related to our technology initiatives and the development of medical clinics as part of our living well health center initiative 
during the year ending december   the company s financing activities consisted of proceeds received from the issuance of common stock related to the ipo in february of million  which was used in its entirety to pay off all outstanding indebtedness  and million of funds received from cms for the benefit of members with part d drug coverage 
these funds from cms are recorded as a liability on our balance sheet at december  we anticipate settling this amount with cms in as part of the final settlement of part d for the plan year 
because the medicare part d program was implemented effective january   there are no comparable subsidies received in prior years 
we expect cash flows in to include inflows for similar subsidies or funds from cms related to the medicare year 
for the combined twelve months ended december   the primary investing and financing activities related to the recapitalization 
the company also had million of capital expenditures 
during  the company made distributions to its members and minority interest holders of its subsidiary companies in the amount 
table of contents of million and purchased million of investments 
additionally  the company had capital expenditures in the amount of million in statutory capital requirements our hmo subsidiaries are required to maintain satisfactory minimum net worth requirements established by their respective state departments of insurance 
at december   our texas minimum million  actual million  tennessee minimum million  actual million and alabama minimum million  actual million hmo subsidiaries were in compliance with statutory minimum net worth requirements 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the state departments of insurance can require our hmo subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory capital in excess of amounts required under the applicable state law if they determine that maintaining additional statutory capital is in the best interest of our members 
the hmos are restricted from making distributions without appropriate regulatory notifications and approvals or to the extent such distributions would put them out of compliance with statutory net worth requirements 
at december   million of the company s million of cash  cash equivalents  investment securities and restricted investments were held by the company s hmo subsidiaries and subject to these dividend restrictions 
our texas hmo subsidiary distributed million and million in cash to the parent company in august and december  respectively 
indebtedness in april  the company and certain of its non hmo subsidiaries as guarantors entered into a senior revolving credit facility  which provides for borrowings of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of million  including a million swingline subfacility and a maximum of million in outstanding letters of credit 
the obligations under our senior revolving credit facility are secured by all of our assets 
we may request an expansion of the aggregate commitments under the senior credit facility up to a maximum of million  subject to certain conditions precedent including the consent of the lenders providing the increased credit availability 
loans under the senior credit facility accrue interest on the basis of either a base rate or a libor rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin depending on our leverage ratio 
the applicable margin for base rate loans including swingline loans ranges from to  and the applicable margin for libor loans ranges from to 
we pay a fee of per annum on the unfunded portion of the lenders aggregate commitments under the facility 
the senior credit facility contains conditions to making loans  representations  warranties and covenants  including financial covenants  customary for a transaction of this type 
financial covenants include i a ratio of total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda not to exceed to  ii minimum risk based capital for each hmo subsidiary  and iii a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to 
the senior credit facility also contains customary events of default as well as restrictions on undertaking certain specified corporate actions including  among others  asset dispositions  acquisitions and other investments  dividends  changes in control  issuance of capital stock  fundamental corporate changes such as mergers and consolidations  incurrence of additional indebtedness  creation of liens  transactions with affiliates  and agreements as to certain subsidiary restrictions 
if an event of default occurs that is not otherwise waived or cured  the lenders may terminate their obligations to make loans under the senior credit facility and the obligations of the issuing banks to issue letters of credit and may declare the loans then outstanding under the senior credit facility to be due and payable 
we believe we are currently in compliance with our financial and other covenants under the senior credit facility 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under the senior revolving credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangement requiring disclosure

effective january  we entered into a new seven year operating lease for approximately  square feet of office space in nashville  tennessee 
the average annual rent for the new space is approximately  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in estimates are recorded if and when better information becomes available 
actual results could significantly differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
medical expense and medical claims liability medical expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of medical expense that has been incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr 
medical expense includes claim payments  capitation payments  and pharmacy costs  net of rebates  as well as estimates of future payments of claims incurred  net of reinsurance 
capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees disbursed to physicians and other providers who are responsible for providing medical care to members 
pharmacy costs represent payments for members prescription drug benefits  net of rebates from drug manufacturers 
rebates are recognized when earned  according to the contractual arrangements with the respective vendors 
premiums we pay to reinsurers are reported as medical expenses and related reinsurance recoveries are reported as deductions from medical expenses 
medical claims liability includes medical claims reported to the plans but not yet paid as well as an actuarially determined estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the plans 
the following table presents the components of our medical claims liability as of the dates indicated december  in thousands incurred but not reported ibnr reported claims total medical claims liability the ibnr component of total medical claims liability is based on our historical claims data  current enrollment  health service utilization statistics  and other related information 
estimating ibnr is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment 
accordingly  it represents our most critical accounting estimate 
changes in this estimate can materially affect  either favorably or unfavorably  our consolidated operating results and overall financial position 

table of contents our policy is to record each plan s best estimate of medical expense ibnr 
using actuarial models  we calculate a minimum amount and maximum amount of the ibnr component 
to most accurately determine the best estimate  our actuaries determine the point estimate within their minimum and maximum range by similar medical expense categories within lines of business 
the medical expense categories we use are in patient facility  outpatient facility  all professional expense  and pharmacy 
the lines of business are medicare and commercial 
at each of december  and  our point estimate was between the mid point and the maximum amount of our ibnr range 
the development of the ibnr estimate generally considers favorable and unfavorable prior period developments and uses standard actuarial developmental methodologies  including completion factors  claims trends  and provisions for adverse claims developments 
the completion factors estimates liabilities for claims based upon the historical lag between the month when services are rendered and the month claims are paid and takes into consideration factors such as expected medical cost inflation  seasonality patterns  product mix  and membership changes 
the completion factor is a measure of how complete the claims paid to date are relative to the estimate of the total claims for services rendered for a given reporting period 
although the completion factor is generally reliable for older service periods  it is more volatile  and hence less reliable  for more recent periods given that the typical billing lag for services can range from a week to as much as days from the date of service 
our use of the claims trend factors considers many aspects of the managed care business 
these considerations are aggregated in the medical expense trend and include the incidences of illness or disease state such as cardiac heart failure cases  cases of upper respiratory illness  the length and severity of the flu season  diabetes  and the number of neonatal intensive care babies 
accordingly  we rely upon our historical experience  as continually monitored  to reflect the ever changing mix  needs  and growth of our members in our trend assumptions 
among the factors considered by management are changes in the level of benefits provided to members  seasonal variations in utilization  identified industry trends  and changes in provider reimbursement arrangements  including changes in the percentage of reimbursements made on a capitated as opposed to a fee for service basis 
other external factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  catastrophes  and epidemics may impact medical expense trends 
other internal factors  such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical expense trends 
medical expense trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy 
we apply different estimation methods depending on the month of service for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for the more recent months  which constitute the majority of the amount of ibnr  we estimate our claims incurred by applying the observed trend factors to the pmpm 
for prior months  costs have been estimated using completion factors 
in order to estimate the pmpms for the most recent months  we validate our estimates of the most recent months utilization levels to the utilization levels in older months using actuarial techniques that incorporate a historical analysis of claim payments  including trends in cost of care provided  and timeliness of submission and processing of claims 
our provision for adverse claims development is intended to account for variability in the following types of factors changes in claims payment patterns to the extent to which emerging claims payment patterns differ from the historical payment patterns selected to calculate the ibnr reserve estimate  differences between the estimated pmpm incurred expense for the most recent months and the expected pmpm based on historical pmpm incurred estimates and the estimated trend from the historical period to the most recent months  differences between the estimated impact of known differences in environmental factors and the actual impact of known environmental factors  and the healthcare expense impact of present but unknown environmental factors that differ from historical norms 
we believe that our provision for adverse claims development is appropriate because our hindsight analysis indicates this additional provision is needed to cover additional unknown adverse claims not anticipated by the standard assumptions used to produce the ibnr estimates that were incurred prior to but paid after a period end 
for the years ended december  and  our provision for adverse claims development has been relatively 
table of contents consistent  varying as of the end of each annual period by less than of the medical claims liability 
fluctuations within those periods and as of the period ends are primarily attributable to differences in membership mix between medicare and commercial plans and differences in services such as in patient or outpatient services provided by our plans 
based on these fluctuations  we expect that our experience on a going forward basis would result in our provision for adverse claims  as a percentage of medical claims liability  not varying by more than from one quarterly period to the next 
the completion and claims trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors that management believes are reasonably likely based on our historical experience and december  data completion factor a claims trend factor b increase increase increase decrease increase decrease decrease in medical decrease in medical in factor claims liability in factor claims liability dollars in thousands a impact due to change in completion factor for the most recent three months 
completion factors indicate how complete claims paid to date are in relation to estimates for a given reporting period 
accordingly  an increase in completion factor results in a decrease in the remaining estimated liability for medical claims 
b impact due to change in annualized medical cost trends used to estimate pmpm costs for the most recent three months 
each month  we re examine the previously established medical claims liability estimates based on actual claim submissions and other relevant changes in facts and circumstances 
as the liability estimates recorded in prior periods become more exact  we increase or decrease the amount of the estimates  and include the changes in medical expenses in the period in which the change is identified 
in every annual reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with prior years 
the following table provides a reconciliation of changes in medical claims liability for the years ended december  and the presentation represents a combined summary for the twelve months ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  in thousands combined balance at beginning of period incurred related to current period prior period total incurred paid related to current period prior period total paid balance at the end of the period the negative amounts reported in the table above for incurred related prior periods result from claims being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally estimated a favorable development 
a positive amount reported for incurred related to prior periods would result from claims ultimately being settled for amounts greater than 
table of contents originally estimated an unfavorable development 
for the years ended december   and actual claims expense developed favorably by and  respectively  as compared to estimated medical claims expense 
our medical claims liability also considers premium deficiency situations and evaluates the necessity for additional related liabilities 
premium deficiency accruals were approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
premium revenue recognition we generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from cms and  to a lesser extent our commercial customers  to provide healthcare benefits to our members 
we receive premium payments on a pmpm basis from cms to provide healthcare benefits to our medicare members  which premium is fixed on an annual basis by contract with cms 
although the amounts we receive from cms for each member is fixed  the amount varies among medicare plans according to  among other things  demographics  geographic location  age  gender  and the relative risk score of the plan s membership 
we generally receive premiums on a monthly basis in advance of providing services 
premiums collected in advance are deferred and reported as deferred revenue 
we recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
any amounts that have not been received are recorded on the balance sheet as accounts receivable 
we experience adjustments to our revenue based on member retroactivity  which reflect changes in the number and eligibility status of enrollees subsequent to when revenue is received 
we estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity each period and adjust premium revenue accordingly 
the estimates of retroactivity adjustments are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the volume of member and contract renewal activity  and other information 
we refine our estimates and methodologies based upon actual retroactivity experienced 
to date  member based retroactivity adjustments have not been significant 
additionally  our medicare premium revenue is adjusted periodically to give effect to a risk component 
risk adjustment uses health status indicators to improve the accuracy of payments and establish incentives for plans to enroll and treat less healthy medicare beneficiaries 
cms initially phased in this payment methodology in whereby the risk adjusted payment represented of the payment to medicare health plans  with the remaining being based on demographic factors 
in and  the portion of risk adjusted payments was increased to and  respectively  and will increase to in the pdp payment methodology is based on the risk adjustment model 
under risk adjustment methodology  managed care plans must capture  collect  and submit diagnosis code information to cms twice a year 
after reviewing the respective submissions  cms adjusts the payments to medicare plans generally at the beginning of the calendar year and during the third quarter and then issues a final payment in a subsequent year 
during and we were not able to estimate the impact of these risk adjustments and as such recorded them on an as received basis 
our retroactivity adjustments in and were positive 
beginning in january  we are able to estimate and record risk adjustment payment amounts on a monthly basis 
the monthly part d payments healthspring receives from cms generally represents healthspring s bid amount for providing prescription drug coverage  both standard and supplemental  and is recognized as premium revenue 
payments from cms are based on these estimated costs 
the amount of cms payments relating to the part d standard coverage for healthspring medicare advantage including ma pd and pdp plans is subject to adjustment  positive or negative  based upon the application of risk corridors that compare healthspring s prescription drug costs in its original bids to cms to healthspring s actual prescription drug costs 
variances exceeding certain thresholds  or symmetric risk corridors  may result in cms making additional payments to healthspring or healthspring s refunding to cms a portion of the premium payments it previously received 
healthspring estimates and recognizes an adjustment to premium revenue related to estimated risk corridor payments based upon its actual prescription drug cost for each reporting period as if the annual contract were to end at the end of each reporting period  in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting for multiple year retrospectively rated insurance contracts by insurance enterprises and other enterprises 
net liabilities to cms of approximately million related to estimated risk corridor adjustments are included on the company s december  balance sheet 
this net liability arises as a result of the company s actual costs to date in providing part d benefits being lower than its bids 
the amount was also recognized in the statement of income as a reduction of premium revenue 
risk corridor adjustments do not take into account estimated future prescription drug 
table of contents cost experience 
actual risk corridor payments upon settlement with cms could differ materially  favorably or unfavorably  from our estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
substantially all of our goodwill and other intangible assets were recorded in connection with the recapitalization 
our primary identifiable intangible assets include our medicare member network  our healthspring trade name  our provider networks  customer relationships  and non compete agreements 
goodwill is determined to have an indefinite useful life and is not amortized  but instead is tested for impairment at least annually 
the company has established december as its annual testing date 
poor operating results or changes in market conditions could result in an impairment of goodwill 
other intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment at least annually 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows 
accounting for income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the amount of deferred taxes on these temporary differences is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled  as applicable  based on tax rates and laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as of the balance sheet date 
the company reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  applicable tax strategies  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company also has accruals for taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities 
we accrue for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated 
although we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable  we nevertheless have established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken by us resulting in additional liabilities for taxes and interest 
these amounts are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes  such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations  conclusion of tax audits  additional exposure based on current calculations  identification of new issues  release of administrative guidance  or rendering of a court decision affecting a particular tax issue 
this policy may be impacted by the adoption of the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin in recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in addition  fin provides guidance on recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the provisions of fin are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of this standard 
only tax positions that meet the relevant recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of fin the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin should be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year adopted 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fin but do not currently anticipate the cumulative effect of adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  we had the following assets that may be sensitive to changes in interest rates december  asset class in thousands investment securities  available for sale investment securities  held to maturity current portion long term portion restricted investments we have not purchased any of our investments for trading purposes 
our investment securities classified as available for sale are repurchase agreements 
for all other investment securities  we intend to hold them to their maturity and classify them as current on our balance sheet if they mature between three and months from the balance sheet date and as long term if their maturity is more than one year from the balance sheet date 
these investment securities  both current and long term  consist of highly liquid government and corporate debt obligations  a substantial majority of which mature in five years or less 
the investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
because of the relatively short term nature of our investments  however  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly as a result of a sudden change in market interest rates 
moreover  because of our ability and intent to hold these investments until maturity  we would not expect foreseeable changes in interest rates to materially impair their carrying value 
restricted investments consist of certificates of deposit and government securities deposited or pledged to state departments of insurance in accordance with state rules and regulations 
at december  and december   these restricted assets are recorded at amortized cost and classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date because of the restrictive nature of the states requirements 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase in market interest rates at december   the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately  similarly  a decrease in market interest rates at december  would result in an increase of the fair value of our investments of approximately  unless we determined  however  that the increase in interest rates caused more than a temporary impairment in our investments  or unless we were compelled by a currently unforeseen reason to sell securities  such a change should not affect our future earnings or cash flows 
as required by our previous term loan facility  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in july  pursuant to which million of the principal amount outstanding under the term loan facility bore interest at a fixed annual rate of plus the applicable margin for the period from january  to the date we repaid the outstanding indebtedness in february the swap did not qualify for hedge accounting 
accordingly  the company recorded the change in the swap s fair market value as a component of earnings 
at december   the fair market value of the swap was approximately  this loan facility was paid off and the swap was settled in connection with the ipo in february accordingly  the company is not currently exposed to market interest rate fluctuations on borrowings
