item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our revenues are derived from product sales  which include both licenses of our test system software and sales of our test system hardware  and from services  which include customer support under hardware and software support contracts as well as training 
prices for our test systems vary widely depending upon overall system configuration factors  including the number and type of software protocol modules and the number of physical interfaces required by the customer 
a system sale typically ranges in price from approximately  to over  in addition to the initial system purchase  customers also may upgrade their systems by purchasing additional software protocol modules and hardware 
product sales are recognized upon delivery  provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and fair value exists for any undelivered elements of the arrangement 
we offer product warranties for various lengths of time  depending on the product and the country of purchase or operation 
customers may elect to purchase a software support contract that includes both ongoing technical support and any new software releases on a when and if available basis during the term of the contract 
revenues from software support contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period  which is generally one year 
new customers often purchase on site training  which is charged based on the number of days provided and recognized when delivered 
conditions and trends in our industry in our fiscal year ended september   we experienced lower revenues due to the effects of consolidation among major customers outside japan  such as alcatel lucent which also acquired the g wireless business from nortel and nokia siemens networks  and to continued competition from our customers own test equipment offerings in the japanese market 
these factors resulted in reduced purchasing of our products and services by our customers throughout the world 
we expect these factors to continue to impact our revenues in fiscal summary of our financial performance in fiscal compared to fiscal our operating financial performance in the fiscal year ended september  deteriorated in comparison with our performance in the previous fiscal year our revenues decreased by to million and our operating loss increased to million from million 
the revenue decrease was greatest in the two geographic sales regions that were most affected by customer consolidation revenues in europe fell by to million and revenues in other markets referred to by us as rest of world fell by to million 
revenues in rest of world were also impacted by lower test spending by domestic chinese customers 
revenues in north america and japan fell by and  respectively 
revenues in fiscal were not affected by product development delays such as those we experienced in fiscal we saw an increase of four percentage points in our gross profit margin to the level due primarily to a reduction of million in amortization charges as a result of the absence in fiscal of the non cash impairment charge for intangible assets that was recorded in fiscal 
table of contents operating expenses decreased by million  primarily due to the following expense reductions million in non cash amortization charges as a result of the impairment charge for intangible assets recorded in fiscal  million in accounting expenses  million in restructuring charges  million in contractor and consultant expenses  million in expenses associated with new product introductions  million in distributor commissions  and million in employee compensation  net of increases in variable compensation and exchange rate effects  due to a reduction in headcount of  or employees  in the number of employees engaged in research and development  sales and marketing and administration 
these reductions were partly offset by an increase of million in non cash stock option expenses 
operating expense fluctuations are discussed in more detail in the section below entitled fiscal years ended september  and 
our net loss in fiscal was further reduced by three additional factors an increase of million in interest income from the fiscal level  other income of million in fiscal  representing the value of shares received in a legal settlement  and a million reduction in our provision for income taxes due primarily to the absence of the million increase in the non cash valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets that we recorded in fiscal during fiscal  our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances decreased by million 
we generated million in cash flows from operating activities and used million for the repurchase of common shares and million for capital expenditures net of disposals 
our sources and uses of cash are discussed in more detail in the section below entitled liquidity and capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the accounting policies below and the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying these policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below and throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected future financial results 
we also have other key accounting policies 
we believe that these other policies either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
for a discussion on the application of these other accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition sales of our product arrangements normally include hardware and software 
we also offer training  consulting and maintenance services separately from our product arrangements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  as follows 

table of contents in connection with each transaction involving these arrangements we examine the customer agreement and or purchase order to determine that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and there is no basis for considering that the transaction forms a single arrangement with one or more other transactions 
we assess that the fee is fixed or determinable by verifying that it is not subject to an agreement to provide additional products or services at a later date or to renegotiation or contingencies including refund  right of return or third party financing or transactions  and that the payment terms do not extend significantly beyond our customary range 
we assess that collection is probable based on customer credit information and payment history 
subject to the foregoing considerations  we recognize revenue on product sales upon delivery 
we recognize revenues allocated to training and consulting services at the time the services are completed 
we recognize revenues allocated to maintenance ratably over the term of the maintenance contract during which the services are delivered 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe 
if we have vsoe for the undelivered elements only  we allocate value using the residual method  under which we defer revenue from the arrangement fee equivalent to the vsoe of the undelivered elements and apply any discount to the delivered elements 
vsoe for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations within an arrangement is based upon substantive renewal rates quoted in the contracts or  in the absence of stated renewal rates  upon a history of separate sales of renewals to each customer or class of customers 
vsoe for services such as training or consulting is based upon separate sales of these services to other customers without the bundling of other elements 
the amount and timing of revenue recognized in any period may differ materially if we make different judgments in any of these areas involving revenue recognition 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets  and our accrued liability for uncertain tax positions 
at the end of each interim reporting period  we estimate an expected effective tax rate for the full fiscal year based on our most current forecast of pre tax income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies 
we use this effective rate to provide for income taxes on a year to date basis  excluding the effect of discrete items or items that are reported net of their related tax effects 
we recognize the tax effect of discrete items in the period in which they occur 
deferred tax assets and liabilities included on our consolidated balance sheet arise from temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue for tax and accounting purposes 
we assess the likelihood that the value of our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
if we establish or increase a valuation allowance in a period  the change is included as an expense within the tax provision in our consolidated statement of operations 
based on our revised estimates concerning future pre tax us profitability that resulted from updates in the fourth quarter of fiscal to our forecasts of future revenues and cash flows  as of september  we recorded a full valuation allowance against all of our us deferred tax assets 
a million partial valuation allowance had been recorded in fiscal if actual future profitability exceeds our estimates or if we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to reduce our valuation allowances  which could materially improve our financial position and results of operations 
no reduction in the valuation allowance was made in fiscal we operate in numerous tax jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various us federal  us state  and foreign tax authorities 
our income tax filing positions in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business are supported by interpretations of the local income tax laws and rulings 
cross jurisdictional transactions involving the transfer prices for products  services and intellectual property comprise our significant income tax exposures 
tax authorities are increasingly asserting interpretations of laws and facts to challenge 
table of contents cross jurisdictional transactions 
we regularly assess our position with regard to tax exposures  and we record liabilities for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties  if any  according to the principles of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  based on our estimate of the possibility that additional taxes will be due 
due to the uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax matters  actual amounts payable as finally determined by tax audits may differ from our estimates  and such differences could have a material effect on our financial position 
additional information regarding income taxes is contained in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign exchange risk and derivative financial instruments our foreign subsidiaries operate and sell our products in various global markets 
as a result  we are exposed to changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated transactions 
when such exposure is considered material  we may use foreign currency forward exchange contracts  and we infrequently use currency options  to mitigate the risk of future movements in foreign exchange rates that affect certain foreign currency denominated receivables or expected revenues 
the forward contracts and options are not designated as accounting hedges 
we attempt to match the forward contracts with the underlying receivables in terms of currency  amount and maturity  and to match the options with expected foreign currency revenue in terms of currency  amount and recognition period 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
gains or losses on forward contracts and options as well as the cost of the options are included in other income expense  net 
to the extent that our judgment in mitigating the risk of movements in foreign exchange rates is imperfect  we may incur foreign exchange losses that could affect our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts and excess or obsolete inventory when judging the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we specifically analyze accounts receivable  historical bad debt experience  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
bad debt expenses recognized in any period may differ materially if we make different judgments 
our accounts receivable balance as of september  was million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and write down excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
we make significant estimates and assumptions based on our judgment of inventory age  shipment history and our forecast of future demand 
a significant decrease in market demand for our product could result in an increase in our reserve for excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is subject to technological change that could result in an increase in the amount of our reserve for obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
when we record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  we create a new cost basis for the inventory 
recoveries of previously written down inventory are recognized only when the related inventory has been sold and revenue has been recognized 
our inventory balance as of september  was million  net of excess or obsolete inventories of million 
the majority of the allowance for excess or obsolete inventory was acquired in our acquisition of ndb and written off as part of our acquisition accounting 
the amount and timing of cost of goods sold recognized in any period may differ materially if we make different judgments 
goodwill and long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or as other indicators exist for a potential impairment 
we performed our most recent annual impairment test as of september  and determined that we have a single reporting unit 
we did not record an impairment of goodwill during the fiscal years ended september   and in assessing potential impairment  we make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the discounted future cash flows of our reporting unit to determine its fair value 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  projected future operating results  working capital ratios  cash flow  terminal values and growth rates  market discount rates and tax 
table of contents rates 
if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on goodwill to reduce its carrying amount to its estimated fair value 
goodwill was million at september  and sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for assets to be held and used  including acquired intangibles  we initiate a review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable or that the useful life of a long lived asset may be shortened 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying value to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the projected discounted future operating cash flows 
assets to be disposed of and that we have committed to a plan to dispose of  whether through sale or abandonment  are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
in the three months ended september   we initiated an impairment review because updated revenue and cash flow forecast information indicated that the carrying value of long lived and intangible assets might not be recoverable 
as a result  we determined that the carrying value of long lived and intangible assets exceeded the associated projected cash flows and  accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge in the amount of million as of september  the impairment charge was recorded in our consolidated statement of operations as follows approximately million was charged to cost of sales  million to general and administrative expense  and  to sales and marketing expense 
during the fiscal years ended september  and  we did not record any impairment charges on long lived assets or intangible assets 
in assessing potential impairment  we make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the useful lives of intangible assets and the discounted future cash flows that these assets are expected to generate to determine their fair value 
if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges on long lived assets and intangible assets to further reduce the carrying value of these assets 
net intangible assets and long lived assets were million and million at september  and  respectively 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if actual experience differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship of certain items from our consolidated statements of operations to total revenues

the fiscal provision was net of million in tax benefits related to several items  including additional research and development tax benefits resulting both from the retroactive reintroduction of the related tax credit program and from a claim for additional benefits filed as a result of the internal revenue service audit completed at the beginning of the fiscal year 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations to date primarily through cash generated from operations  from the proceeds of our initial public offering completed in early and from the proceeds of a second public offering completed in september the proceeds to us from the and offerings  net of underwriter fees and other expenses  were approximately million and million  respectively 
our purchase of ndb in was additionally financed through the issuance of two convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of million

these non cash items included changes in deferred tax balances  charges for depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisition of ndb  including  in fiscal  impairment charges recorded against these assets  and  in fiscal and  stock based compensation expense 
finally  our cash flows from operations are affected by changes in current assets and liabilities 
these changes in non cash working capital components increased cash flow from operations by million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and decreased cash flow from operations by million in fiscal our primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers 
we measure the effectiveness of our collection efforts by an analysis of average accounts receivable days outstanding days outstanding 
we calculate our days outstanding by dividing our accounts receivable balance net of allowances at the end of a period by the revenues for that period and multiplying the result by the number of days in the period 
our days outstanding improved to days for the year ended september  from days for the year ended september  and days for the year ended september  collections of accounts receivable and related days outstanding will fluctuate in future periods due to the timing and amount of our future revenues  payment terms extended to our customers and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 

table of contents investing activities have consisted of purchases of property and equipment and purchases and sales of short term investments 
purchases of property and equipment net of proceeds of disposals decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal we expect that purchases of property and equipment will total approximately million in fiscal 
we invest cash that is surplus to our operating requirements in professionally managed short term investment portfolios 
these portfolios consist of both cash equivalents and short term investments  and the mix between these elements may vary from period to period due to changes in the investment approaches of the portfolio managers 
net purchases and sales of short term investments provided cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  to assist with funding the repurchase of common stock  and used cash of million in fiscal as surplus cash that we generated was invested 
financing activities used cash of million in fiscal as the million used to repurchase common stock exceeded the million received from the exercise of stock options 
financing activities used cash of million in fiscal as the million used to repurchase common stock exceeded the million received from the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal from the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
we discontinued our employee stock purchase plan in fiscal as of september   we had working capital of million  cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
as of september   we had the following payment obligations in the listed categories of contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in millions operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and funds generated from operations will provide us with sufficient funds to finance our requirements for at least the next months 
in the long term  we are ultimately dependent on funds generated from operations to finance our requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of september   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item of regulation s k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s foreign exchange risk and derivative financial instruments our foreign subsidiaries operate and sell our products in various global markets 
in fiscal  approximately of our revenues resulted from invoices that were issued and paid in japanese yen and in other foreign currencies 
as a result  we are exposed to changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated accounts receivable 
we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts  and we infrequently use options  to mitigate the risk of future movements in foreign exchange rates that affect certain foreign currency denominated receivables or expected revenues 
the forward contracts and options are not designated as accounting hedges 
we attempt to match the forward contracts with the underlying receivables in terms of currency  amount and maturity  and to match the options with expected foreign currency revenue in terms of currency  amount and recognition period 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
because the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts and options generally offsets the related impact on the 
table of contents exposures economically hedged  these derivative financial instruments do not subject us to speculative risk that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
gains and losses on forward exchange contracts generally offset the foreign exchange transaction gains or losses from revaluation of foreign currency denominated amounts receivable 
gains on options generally offset the reduction in income resulting from revenues recognized at an exchange rate less favorable than the option rate 
to date  we have not fully mitigated all risk associated with our revenues and resulting accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies  and there can be no assurance that our future mitigation activities  if any  will be successful 
at september   we had no forward exchange contracts or options outstanding 
we also incur operating expenses in foreign currencies including the japanese yen  the british pound  the euro  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  the swedish krona  the chinese renminbi  the indian rupee and the philippine peso 
in fiscal  we incurred approximately million of operating expenses in foreign currencies 
in japan  our yen operating expenses  which amounted to approximately million in fiscal  are lower than our yen revenues and act as a partial natural hedge on our exposure on those revenues 
our operating expenses in other foreign currencies exceed our revenues in those currencies and thus represent an exchange rate exposure 
we do not attempt to mitigate this operating expense exchange rate exposure through the use of derivatives 
we have evaluated the potential near term losses in future earnings  fair values and cash flows from reasonably possible near term currency fluctuations  and we believe that any such losses would not be material 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
as of september   short term investments consisted of available for sale securities of million see note  balance sheet components in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these fixed income marketable securities included corporate and municipal bonds and notes and government securities  all of which are of high investment grade 
they are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if the market interest rates increase 
if the market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of september   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to our financial position
