item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading provider of semiconductor solutions in the rapidly growing broadband wireless and wireline communications markets 
our products include pas  tuner integrated circuits  active splitters  line amplifiers and other components  which can be sold individually or packaged as integrated rf and front end modules 
we believe that we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the rapidly growing voice  data and video segments of the broadband wireless and wireline communications markets 
we offer g products that use the w cdma and edge standards  g products that use the hsdpa and hsupa standards  g products for wimax and wibro systems  wifi products that use the a b g and n draft n  mimo standards  catv set top box products  catv infrastructure products and fttp products 
our business strategy focuses on developing rf front end solutions and partnering with industry leading wireless chipset providers to incorporate our solutions into their reference designs 
our integrated solutions enable our customers to improve rf performance  power efficiency  reliability  time to market and the integration of chip components into single packages  while reducing the size  weight and cost of their products 
we have established longstanding relationships with several of the industry leading chipset suppliers and tier one customers 
for example  our relationships with cisco  intel  motorola and qualcomm have enabled us to develop rf products used in g  g  g wimax  wifi and catv products and to be the primary supplier with respect to such partners and customers 
other leading chipset suppliers and tier one customers with whom we have longstanding relationships include atheros  htc  huawei  kyocera  lenovo  lg electronics  marvell  mediatek  murata  novatel  palm  rim  samsung  sierra wireless  tcl  tdk  texas instruments and zte 
we continue to focus on leveraging our technological and manufacturing advantages to remain a leading supplier of semiconductor solutions for broadband wireless and wireline communications 
we believe our patented ingap plus technology  which combines the bipolar technology of a pa hbt pa with the surface device technology of an rf active switch phemt on the same die  provides us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
additionally  we believe our ingap plus process and design technologies such as help provide a competitive advantage by enabling us to provide pas that consume less battery power and extend talk time for products in the g  g and g markets 
our primary fab  a state of the art six inch diameter gaas fab located at our corporate headquarters in warren  new jersey  has been operational since the increased utilization of our fab s manufacturing capacity has increased our gross margins  which has provided us with greater financial leverage 
we anticipate that with incremental capital expenditures our warren  new jersey fab will fulfill our manufacturing needs into we are actively exploring future sources of additional manufacturing capacity through the construction or acquisition of manufacturing facilities in low cost manufacturing countries such as china  as well as pursuing relationships with foundries in taiwan 
unlike traditional cmos silicon fabs that have short technology lifecycles and require frequent capital investments  gaas fabs are more similar to analog fabs that have long lifecycles and do not become quickly outdated 
our six inch wafer fab allows us to produce more than twice the rf die per wafer compared with the four inch wafer fabs still used by some of our competitors 
we believe our strong fabrication capability and available capacity  combined with integrated product design and logistics expertise  allow us to quickly develop and manufacture products for which demand has grown 
we have fixed expenses particularly relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead 
accordingly  as unit volume throughput increased in recent years  our fixed production costs decreased as a percentage of revenue and our gross margin and profitability improved 
decreases in volume would have the inverse effect 
we will continue to invest in selected strategic research and development programs to maintain our competitive position 
we experienced net sales growth approximating during and as our broadband and wireless businesses benefited from unit growth in addition to accelerated demand  a better pricing environment and acceptance of new product developments 
these trends were felt across our end markets and continued in in  our businesses grew over  as new product offerings were well timed to market demand and benefited from increased rf content and functionality 
this trend was observed throughout the year and we ended by recording our seventh consecutive quarter of sales growth 
the sales growth and leverage of our fixed manufacturing expense base  led to gross margin increases and substantially lessened our operating and net losses during the period 
we believe our markets are  and will continue to remain  competitive  which could result in continued quarterly volatility in our net sales 
this competition has resulted in  and is expected to continue to result in  declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing market share 
we have only one reportable segment 
for financial information related to such segment and certain geographic areas  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies general we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
such accounting policies may require management to exercise a higher degree of judgment and make estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when the title  risk and rewards of product ownership are transferred to the customer  price and terms are fixed  no significant vendor obligation exists and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we sell to certain distributors who are granted rights of return and exchange and certain price protection 
revenue is not recognized for the portion of shipments subject to return  exchange or price protection until such rights expire 
we charge customers for the costs of certain contractually committed inventories that remain at the end of a product s life 
cancellation revenue is recognized when cash is received 
the value of the inventory related to cancellation revenue may  in some instances  have been reserved during prior periods in accordance with our inventory obsolescence policy 
warranty costs we provide for potential warranty claims by recording a current charge to income 
we estimate potential claims by examining historical returns and other information deemed critical and provide for an amount which we believe will cover future warranty obligations for products sold during the year 
the accrued liability for warranty costs is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
long lived assets long lived assets include fixed assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we regularly review these assets for indicators of impairment and assess the carrying value of the assets against market values 
when an impairment exists  we record an expense to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair market value 
goodwill and intangibles impairment we have intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
significant judgements are involved in the determination of the estimated useful lives for our other intangibles and whether the goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
impairment of long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations or expected to be disposed of when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by these assets is less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
management considers sensitivities to capacity  utilization and technological developments in making its assumptions 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the amount may not be realized 
during  we determined that it was no longer more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  and an adjustment to provide a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset was charged to income 
we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market lcm  using the first in  first out method 
in addition to lcm limitations  we reserve against inventory items for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory is primarily based upon forecasted short term demand for the product and any change to the reserve arising from forecast revisions is reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers failure to make payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to erode  making them unable to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
stock based compensation effective january   we account for stock based compensation costs in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
r share based payment fas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to our employees and directors 
under the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period which in most cases is the vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgement  including estimating expected volatility  expected term and risk free rate 
our expected volatility is a combination of both company and peer company historical volatility 
the expected term of the stock options is based on several factors including historical observations of employee exercise patterns and expectations of employee exercise behavior in the future giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on the yield at the time of grant of a us treasury security with an equivalent remaining term 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
results of operations the following table sets forth statements of operations data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expense selling and administrative expenses restructuring and other charges operating loss interest income interest expense gain on repurchase of convertible notes other income net loss compared to net sales 
net sales during increased to million  compared to million for the net sales improvement was primarily due to new demand from the market s evolution to third generation edge  wedge and w cdma pas  an increase in demand for our traditional cdma and gsm technologies used in wireless handsets and hand held devices  and increased demand for broadband products such as wlan pas  used in wireless personal computer access and rfics  used in infrastructure applications 
sales during of rfics used for cellular and personal communication system applications increased during to million from million in this increase in sales of integrated circuits for wireless applications for the year ended december  compared with was primarily due to increased demand for our g  cdma and gsm pas amounting to million  million and million  respectively 
specifically  net sales of rfics used for broadband applications increased to million in from million in this increase in sales was primarily due to an increase in demand for infrastructure products and increased average selling prices for wlan products accounting for increases in sales of million and million  respectively 
sales of wlan pas benefited from the market transition from b g pas to a b g pas that have a higher selling price for the increased functionality 
gross margin 
gross margin for improved to of net sales  compared with of net sales in the prior year 
the increase in gross margin from the prior year is the result of the increase in net sales and production volumes with the consequent absorption of fixed costs 
research development 
company sponsored research and development expenses increased during to million from million during primarily due to accelerated customer demand for new product development  which led to increased staffing and costs in addition to increased stock based compensation of million 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased during to million from million in the increase was primarily due to increased stock based compensation of million 
restructuring and other charges 
during  we settled an exit obligation for certain redundant leasehold premises resulting in a savings of million against a previously recorded restructuring charge 
interest income 
interest income increased to million during from million in the increase was primarily due to higher average funds invested as a result of our underwritten public offering of million shares of common stock in march of the march offering and higher interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in interest expense arose from obligations under our convertible senior notes due in notes and our convertible senior notes due in notes 
in november  we repaid the remaining million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our notes 
compared to net sales 
net sales in increased to million  compared to million for the increase in net sales of million was primarily due to i an increase of million in our sales of gsm pa products used in wireless handsets  ii an increase of million in our sales of wlan pas used in the network computer market and iii an increase of million in our sales of tuner and active splitter products used in the cable set top box market 
partially offsetting these increases were i a decrease of million in our sales of cdma pas and ii a decrease of million in our sales of switch products used in wireless handsets 
the decline in net sales of cdma pas was primarily due to a transition in to lower priced next generation pa modules and declines in average selling prices 
the decline in net sales of switch products was primarily due to our decision to reduce our research and development expenditures in this product line 
specifically  net sales in of our wireless products increased to million compared to million for net sales in of our broadband products increased to million compared to million in gross margin 
gross margin for improved to of net sales  compared with of net sales in the prior year 
the increase in gross margin from the prior year is the result of increased sales and production volumes with consequent absorption of fixed costs 
the decrease in our depreciation expense of million offset declines in average selling prices 
research development 
company sponsored research and development expenses decreased during to million from million during primarily due to decreased headcount and related compensation expense 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses decreased during to million from million in the decrease was primarily due to decreased headcount  compensation expense and related costs within sales and marketing 
restructuring and other charges 
during  we settled an exit obligation for certain redundant leasehold premises resulting in a savings of million against a previously recorded restructuring charge 
activity and liability balances related to the restructuring and other charges for the years ended december  and are as follows in millions lease related year ended december  beginning balance deductions december  restructuring balance year ended december  deductions savings on settlement of obligation december  restructuring balance interest income 
interest income increased to million during from million in the increase was due to higher average interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in interest expense arises from obligations under our notes and our notes 
in september  we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of our notes and consequently reduced the outstanding principal balance to million  and concurrently issued million aggregate principal amount of our notes 
gain on repurchase of convertible notes 
during  we recognized a gain of million  on the repurchase of million aggregate principal amount of our notes  after adjusting for accrued interest and the write off of a proportionate share of unamortized offering costs 
liquidity and sources of capital at december  we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and million in marketable securities 
we had million aggregate principal amount of our notes outstanding as of december  operations required the use of million in cash during investing activities used million of cash during  consisting principally of purchases of equipment of million  partially offset by net proceeds on sales of marketable securities of million 
financing activities provided million of cash in  primarily consisting of proceeds received from the issuance of stock  principally from the march offering  and was partially offset by the million repayment of our convertible notes 
we believe that our existing sources of capital  including our existing cash and marketable securities  will be adequate to satisfy operational needs and anticipated capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
our anticipated capital needs may include acquisitions of complimentary businesses or technologies  investments in other companies or repurchases of our outstanding debt or equity 
we may elect to finance all or part of our future capital requirements through additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing would be available on satisfactory terms 
our ability to pay principal and interest on our million in outstanding convertible senior unsecured notes  which are due in october of  and our other debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures depends on our future operating performance 
the table below summarizes required cash payments as of december  contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt plus the interest payable with respect thereto operating leases capital leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations impact of recently issued accounting standards effective january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our investments in certain available for sale securities 
our available for sale securities consist primarily of fixed income investments  including corporate bonds  commercial paper and federal  state  municipal  and agency securities 
we continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and the credit ratings of issuers with respect to our available for sale securities 
accordingly  we believe that the effects of changes in interest rates and the credit ratings of these issuers are limited and would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  it is possible that we would be at risk if interest rates or the credit ratings of these issuers were to change in an unfavorable direction 
the magnitude of any gain or loss would be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
at december   we held marketable securities with an estimated fair value of million 
our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short term interest rates 
we do not purchase financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
all of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities 
the following table provides information about our marketable securities at december  estimated principal amount and weighted average stated rate by expected maturity value fair value s total s principal weighted average stated rates the stated rates of interest expressed in the above table may not approximate the actual yield of the securities which we currently hold since we have purchased some of our marketable securities at other than face value 
additionally  some of the securities represented in the above table may be called or redeemed  at the option of the issuer  prior to their expected due dates 
if such early redemptions occur  we may reinvest the proceeds realized on such calls or redemptions in marketable securities with stated rates of interest or yields that are lower than those of our current holdings  which would affect both future cash interest streams and future earnings 
in addition to investments in marketable securities  we invest some of our cash in money market funds in order to keep cash available to fund operations and to hold cash pending investments in marketable securities 
fluctuations in short term interest rates will affect the yield on monies invested in such money market funds 
such fluctuations can have an impact on our future cash interest streams and future earnings  but the impact of such fluctuations are not expected to be material 
our notes are convertible and bear a fixed rate of interest of 
a change in interest rates on long term debt is assumed to impact fair value but not earnings or cash flow because the interest rate is fixed 
at december   the fair value of our outstanding convertible notes  estimated based upon dealer quotes  was approximately million
