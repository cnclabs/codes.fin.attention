moreover  from time to time  we may issue other forward looking statements 
forward looking statements regarding financial performance in future periods  including the statements under outlook for fiscal  do not reflect potential impacts of mergers or acquisitions or other significant transactions or events that have not been announced as of the time the statements are made 
actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in forward looking statements 
we disclaim any obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect future events or revised expectations 
the following discussion highlights factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
weakness in the united states and international economies may materially adversely impact us 
the united states and international economies are cyclical and experience periodic economic downturns  which may have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
weakness in these economies may materially adversely impact the timing and receipt of orders for our products and our results of operations 
revenue levels are dependent on the level of technology capital spending  which includes worldwide expenditures for eda software  hardware and consulting services 
we are subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries and any future downturns may materially adversely impact us 
purchases of our products and services are highly dependent upon new design projects initiated by customers in the integrated circuit ic and electronics systems industries 
these industries are highly cyclical and are subject to constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence  price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the ic and electronics systems industries regularly experience significant downturns  often connected with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles within such companies or a decline in general economic conditions 
these downturns can cause diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
intense competition in the eda industry could materially adversely impact us 
competition in the eda industry is intense  which can lead to  among other things  price reductions  longer selling cycles  lower product margins  loss of market share and additional working capital requirements 
if our competitors offer significant discounts on certain products  we may need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully 
any such changes would likely reduce margins and could materially adversely impact our operating results 
any broad based changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause new software license and service revenues to decline or be delayed as the sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies 
some of our competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a long term pricing strategy 
these practices could significantly constrain prices we can charge for our products 
we currently compete primarily with two large companies cadence design systems  inc and synopsys  inc 
we also compete with numerous smaller companies 
we also compete with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed  or have the capability to develop  their own eda products internally 
ic and pcb technology evolves rapidly 
the complexity of ics and printed circuit boards continues to rapidly increase 
in response to this increasing complexity  new design tools and methodologies must be invented or acquired quickly to remain competitive 
if we fail to quickly respond to new technological developments  our products could become obsolete or uncompetitive  which could materially adversely impact our business 
our forecasts of our revenues and earnings outlook may be inaccurate and could materially adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations 
our revenues  particularly new software license revenues  are difficult to forecast 
we use a pipeline system  a common industry practice  to forecast revenues and trends in our business 
sales personnel monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision  the dollar amount of the sale and the products or services to be sold 
these estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline 
our pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time  in part because the conversion rate of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate and requires management judgment 
a variation in the conversion rate could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and materially adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations 
in particular  a slowdown in customer spending or weak economic conditions generally can reduce the conversion rate in a particular quarter as purchasing decisions are delayed  reduced in amount or cancelled 
the conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal quarter attempting to obtain more favorable terms 

table of contents fluctuations in quarterly results of operations due to customer seasonal purchasing patterns  the timing of significant orders and the mix of licenses used to sell our products could materially adversely impact our business and the market price of our common stock 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  varied quarterly operating results 
various factors affect our quarterly operating results and some of these are not within our control  including customer demand and the timing of significant orders 
we experience seasonality in demand for our products  due to the purchasing cycles of our customers  with revenues in the fourth quarter generally being the highest 
we receive a majority of our software product revenues from current quarter order performance  of which a substantial amount is usually booked in the last few weeks of each quarter 
a significant portion of our revenues come from multi million dollar contracts  the timing of the completion of and the terms of delivery of which can have a material impact on revenue for a given quarter 
if we fail to receive expected orders  particularly large orders  our revenues for that quarter could be materially adversely impacted 
in such an event  we could fail to meet investors expectations  which could have a material adverse impact on our stock price 
our revenues are also affected by the mix of licenses entered into where we recognize software product revenues as payments become due and payable  on a cash basis  or ratably over the license term as compared to revenues recognized at the beginning of the license term 
we recognize revenues ratably over the license term for instance  when the customer is provided with rights to unspecified or unreleased future products 
a shift in the license mix toward increased ratable or due and payable revenue recognition would result in increased deferral of software product revenues to future periods and would decrease current revenues  which could result in us not meeting near term revenue expectations 
the gross margin on our software products is greater than that for our hardware products  software support and professional services 
therefore  our gross margin may vary as a result of the mix of products and services sold 
additionally  the gross margin on software products varies year to year depending on the amount of royalties due to third parties for the mix of products sold 
we also have a significant amount of fixed or relatively fixed costs  such as employee costs and purchased technology amortization  and costs which are committed in advance and can only be adjusted periodically 
as a result  a small failure to reach planned revenues would likely have a relativity large negative effect on resulting earnings 
if anticipated revenues do not materialize as expected  our gross margins and operating results would be materially adversely impacted 
accounting rules governing revenue recognition may change 
the accounting rules governing software revenue recognition have been subject to authoritative interpretations that have generally made it more difficult to recognize software product revenues at the beginning of the license period 
if this trend continues  new and revised standards and interpretations could materially adversely impact our ability to meet near term revenue expectations 
the outcome of internal revenue service and other tax authorities examinations could have a material adverse affect on us 
the internal revenue service and tax authorities in countries where we do business regularly examine our tax returns 
significant judgment and estimates are required in determining the provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities 
for example  our interim tax provision expense is based on our expectation of profit and loss by jurisdiction  and if the mix is different from our estimates our actual tax expense could be materially different 
our tax expense may also be impacted if our intercompany transactions  which are required to be computed on an arm s length basis  are challenged and successfully disputed by the tax authorities 
also  our tax expense could be impacted depending on the applicability of withholding taxes on term based licenses and related intercompany transactions in certain jurisdictions 
in determining the adequacy of income taxes  we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from the internal revenue service and other tax authorities examinations 
the ultimate outcome of these examinations cannot be predicted with certainty 
should the internal revenue service or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of examinations  we may be required to record charges to operations that could have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we were issued notices of proposed adjustments nopas in august see provision for income taxes discussion in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion 
forecasting our tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty 
forecasts of our income tax position and resultant effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty as our tax position for each year combines a the effects of a mix of profits losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates  b changes in valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets  c taxes  interest or penalties resulting from tax audits and d changes in the tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws 
in order to forecast our global tax rate  pre tax profits and losses by jurisdiction are estimated and tax expense by jurisdiction is calculated 
if the mix of profits and losses or effective tax rates by jurisdiction are different than those estimates  our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecast 
customer payment defaults could materially adversely impact us 
we use fixed term license agreements as a standard business practice with customers we believe are credit worthy 
these multi year  multi element term license agreements are typically three years in length and have payments spread over the license term 
the complexity of these agreements tends to increase the risk associated with collectibility from customers that can arise for a variety of reasons including ability to pay  product dissatisfaction  disagreements and disputes 
if we are unable to collect under these agreements  our results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
we use these fixed term license agreements as a standard business practice and have a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making 
table of contents concessions on payments  products or services 
if we no longer had a history of collecting without providing concessions on term agreements  then revenue would be required to be recognized as the payments become due and payable over the license term 
this change would have a material impact on our results 
there are limitations on the effectiveness of controls 
we do not expect that disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  have been detected 
failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us 
the lengthy sales cycle for our products and services and delay in customer completion of projects  make the timing of our revenues difficult to predict 
we have a lengthy sales cycle that generally extends between three and nine months 
a lengthy customer evaluation and approval process is generally required due to the complexity and expense associated with our products and services 
consequently  we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenues and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 
in addition  sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects due to customers budgetary constraints  internal acceptance review procedures  timing of budget cycles or timing of competitive evaluation processes 
any loss of our leadership position in certain segments of the eda market could have a material adverse affect on us 
the industry in which we compete is characterized by very strong leadership positions in specific segments of the eda market 
for example  one company may enjoy a large percentage of sales in the physical verification segment of the market while another will have a similarly strong position in mixed signal simulation 
these strong leadership positions can be maintained for significant periods of time as the software is difficult to master and customers are disinclined to make changes once their employees  as well as others in the industry  have developed familiarity with a particular software product 
for these reasons  much of our profitability arises from niche areas in which we are the leader 
conversely  it is difficult for us to achieve significant profits in niche areas where other companies are the leaders 
if for any reason we lose our leadership position in a niche  we could be materially adversely impacted 
our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both costs and the risk of noncompliance  which could have a material adverse impact on us 
because our common stock is publicly traded on the nasdaq stock market  we are subject to rules and regulations issued by a number of governmental and self regulated organizations  including the sec  nasdaq and the public company accounting oversight board  which monitors the accounting practices of public companies 
many of these regulations continue to evolve  making compliance difficult and uncertain 
in particular  section of the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations have required us to include a management assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and auditor attestation of that assessment in our annual reports 
this effort has required  and continues to require  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
a failure to complete a favorable assessment and obtain an auditors attestation could have a material adverse impact on us 
we may not realize revenues as a result of our investments in research and development 
we incur substantial expense to develop new software products 
research and development activities are often performed over long periods of time 
this effort may not yield a successful product offering or the product may not satisfy customer requirements 
as a result  we would realize little or no revenues related to our investment in research and development 
we may acquire other companies and may not successfully integrate them 
the industry in which we compete has seen significant consolidation in recent years 
during this period  we have acquired numerous businesses and have frequently been in discussions with potential acquisition candidates  and we may acquire other businesses in the future 
while we expect to carefully analyze all potential transactions before committing to them  we cannot assure that any transaction that is completed will result in long term benefits to us or our shareholders or that we will be able to manage the acquired businesses effectively 
in addition  growth through acquisition involves a number of risks 
if any of the following events occurs after we acquire another business  it could materially adversely impact us difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a single unit  the substantial diversion of management s attention from ongoing business when integrating the acquired business  the discovery after the acquisition has been completed of previously unknown liabilities assumed with the acquired business  the failure to realize anticipated benefits  such as cost savings and increases in revenues  the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business  difficulties related to assimilating the products of an acquired business in  for example  distribution  engineering and customer support areas  
table of contents unanticipated costs  adverse impacts on existing relationships with suppliers and customers  and failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in which we have limited experience 
acquired businesses may not perform as projected  which could result in impairment of acquisition related intangible assets 
additional challenges include integration of sales channels  training and education of the sales force for new product offerings  integration of product development efforts  integration of systems of internal controls and integration of information systems 
accordingly  in any acquisition there will be uncertainty as to the achievement and timing of projected synergies  cost savings and sales levels for acquired products 
all of these factors can impair our ability to forecast  meet revenues and earnings targets and manage effectively our business for long term growth 
we cannot assure that we can effectively meet these challenges 
mergers of our customers appear to be increasing 
a significant number of mergers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred and more are likely 
mergers of our customers can reduce the total level of purchases of our software and services  and in some cases  increase customers bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers  including mentor graphics 
risks of international operations and the effects of foreign currency fluctuations can materially adversely impact our business and operating results 
we obtain more than half of our revenues from customers outside the united states and we generate approximately one third of our expenses outside the united states 
significant changes in exchange rates can have an adverse impact on us 
for further discussion of foreign currency effects  see effects of foreign currency fluctuations discussion in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  international operations subject us to other risks including longer receivables collection periods  changes in a specific country s or region s economic or political conditions  trade protection measures  import or export licensing requirements  loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs  limitations on repatriation of earnings and difficulties with licensing and protecting our intellectual property rights 
the delay in production of components or the ordering of excess components for our emulation hardware products could materially adversely impact us 
the success of our emulation product depends on our ability to procure hardware components on a timely basis from a limited number of suppliers  create stable software for use on the product  assemble and ship hardware and software systems on a timely basis with appropriate quality control  develop distribution and shipment processes  manage inventory and related obsolescence issues and develop processes to deliver customer support for hardware 
our inability to be successful in any of the foregoing could materially adversely impact us 
we generally commit to purchase component parts from suppliers based on sales forecasts of our emulation products 
if we cannot change or be released from these non cancelable purchase commitments  and if orders for our products do not materialize  we could incur significant costs related to the purchase of excess components which could become obsolete before we can use them 
additionally  a delay in production of the components could materially adversely impact our operating results 
our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights or to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses could materially adversely impact us 
our success depends  in large part  upon our proprietary technology 
we generally rely on patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products 
despite precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property  we cannot assure that third parties will not try to challenge  invalidate or circumvent these protections 
the companies in the eda industry  as well as entities and persons outside the industry  are obtaining patents at a rapid rate 
many of these entities have substantially larger patent portfolios than we have 
as a result  we may on occasion be forced to engage in costly patent litigation to protect our rights or defend our customers rights 
we may also need to settle these claims on terms that are unfavorable  such settlements could result in the payment of significant damages or royalties  or force us to stop selling or redesign one or more products 
we cannot assure that the rights granted under our patents will provide us with any competitive advantage  that patents will be issued on any of our pending applications or that future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as united states law protects these rights in the united states 
some of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties  and we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for software and other intellectual property in the future 
our inability to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses or rights from third parties on favorable terms could materially adversely impact us 
future litigation may materially adversely impact us 
future litigation may result in monetary damages  injunctions against future product sales and substantial unanticipated legal costs and divert the efforts of management personnel  any and all of which could materially adversely impact us 

table of contents errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 
our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity and have unique specifications 
due to the complexity of the systems and products with which we work  some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace 
as a result  our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design  or the products or systems incorporating our designs and intellectual property may not operate as expected 
errors or defects could result in loss of current customers and loss of  or delay in  revenue and loss of market share  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources to resolve the problems resulting from errors or defects  and increased service costs 
our failure to attract and retain key employees may harm us 
we depend on the efforts and abilities of our senior management  our research and development staff and a number of other key management  sales  support  technical and services personnel 
competition for experienced  high quality personnel is intense  and we cannot assure that we can continue to recruit and retain such personnel 
our failure to hire and retain such personnel would impair our ability to develop new products and manage our business effectively 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may materially adversely impact the markets on which our securities trade  the markets in which we operate  our operations and our profitability 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and investment in our business 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 
furthermore  these attacks may make travel more difficult and expensive and ultimately affect our revenues 
any armed conflict entered into by the united states could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our ability to deliver products to our customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result from an armed conflict and could negatively impact our business 
we currently have operations in pakistan  egypt and israel  countries that may be particularly susceptible to this risk 
the consequences of any armed conflict are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse impact on us 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
they also could result in economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results  revenues and costs and may result in volatility of the market price for our common stock 
our articles of incorporation  oregon law and our shareholder rights plan may have anti takeover effects 
our board of directors has the authority  without action by the shareholders  to designate and issue up to  shares of incentive stock in one or more series and to designate the rights  preferences and privileges of each series without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
additionally  the oregon control share act and the business combination act limit the ability of parties who acquire a significant amount of voting stock to exercise control over us 
these provisions may have the effect of lengthening the time required to acquire control of us through a proxy contest or the election of a majority of the board of directors 
in february  we adopted a shareholder rights plan  which has the effect of making it more difficult for a person to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors 
the potential issuance of incentive stock  the provisions of the oregon control share act and the business combination act and our shareholder rights plan may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of us  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may materially adversely impact the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
our debt obligations expose us to risks that could materially adversely impact our business  operating results and financial condition  and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 
we have a substantial level of indebtedness 
as of december   we had million of outstanding indebtedness  which includes million of floating rate convertible subordinated debentures due floating rate debentures  million of convertible subordinated debentures due debentures and million in short term borrowings 
this level of indebtedness among other things could make it difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations on our debt  make it difficult for us to incur additional indebtedness or obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service  acquisitions or general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business  reduce funds available for use in our operations  make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business  make us more vulnerable in the event of an increase in interest rates if we must incur new debt to satisfy our obligations under the floating rate debentures and debentures  or place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access to capital resources

we believe that we will be able to renew or replace our existing leases as they expire and that our current facilities will be adequate through at least the year ending january  item legal proceedings from time to time we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise from the ordinary course of business 
these include disputes and lawsuits relating to intellectual property rights  licensing  contracts and employee relations matters

overview the company we are a supplier of electronic design automation eda systems advanced computer software  emulation hardware systems and intellectual property designs and databases used to automate the design  analysis and testing of electronic hardware and embedded systems software in electronic systems and components 
we market our products and services worldwide  primarily to large companies in the communications  computer  consumer electronics  semiconductor  networking  multimedia  military aerospace and transportation industries 
through the diversification of our customer base among these various customer markets  we attempt to reduce our exposure to fluctuations within each market 
we sell and license our products through our direct sales force and a channel of distributors and sales representatives 
in addition to our corporate offices in wilsonville  oregon  we have sales  support  software development and professional service offices worldwide 
we are changing our fiscal year end from december to january our next fiscal year end will be the fiscal year ending january   which we will refer to as fiscal year this change took effect following the completion of the year ended december   and as a result  we will report financial results for the one month transition period ending january  in our form q for the new first fiscal quarter ending april  we did not experience a significant amount of business activity or product shipment in january  and we expect to report a loss for that period 
the low level of expected business activity and product shipment resulted in part from the historical pattern of low levels of business activity in january  and in part because we did not implement significant sales incentive compensation programs for that one month period 
business environment business during the year ended december  was very strong with broad growth in all product lines led by integrated circuit ic design to silicon and scalable verification 
total system and software bookings were up for ic design to silicon and for scalable verification as compared to the prior year 
bookings are the value of executed orders during a period for which revenue has been or will be recognized within six months for products and within twelve months for professional services and training 
during the three months ended december   we experienced a increase in system and software revenues year over year 
with this growth in system and software revenues  we have experienced six consecutive quarters of period over period growth 
for the year ended december   system and software revenues increased from the year ended december  the ten largest customers for the fourth quarter of accounted for approximately of total system and software bookings as compared to in the fourth quarter of the ten largest customers for the full year accounted for approximately of total system and software bookings as compared to for the year ended december  the number of new customers during the three months and year ended december  was comparable to levels experienced during the three months and year ended december  scalable verification product lines performed well for the year 
for the year ended december  fpga  analog mixed signal and formal verification saw bookings growth of  and  respectively  compared to the year ended december  in ic design to silicon  the calibre family of products had a strong year following a record second half of the calibre family of products experienced an increase of in system and software bookings over the year ended december  we believe the fiscal year ending january  looks positive for us and for the eda industry in general 
we believe the renewals of our current fixed term customer contracts  which typically occur every three years  should benefit from the increased research and development spending of our customers compared to three years ago when research and development spending in electronics was depressed 
we will continue our strategy of developing high quality tools with number one market share potential  rather than being a broad line supplier with undifferentiated product offerings 
this strategy allows us to focus investment in areas where customer s needs are greatest and we have the opportunity to build significant market share 
license model mix license model trends can have a material impact on various aspects of our business 
see critical accounting policies revenue recognition for a description of the types of product licenses we sell 
as the mix among perpetual licenses  fixed term licenses term with upfront revenue recognition and term licenses with ratable revenue recognition which includes due and payable revenue recognition shifts  revenues  earnings  cash flow and days sales outstanding dso are either positively or negatively affected 
the year ended december  marked the sixth consecutive year in which  as a percentage of product revenue  term revenue increased while perpetual revenue decreased 
we believe this trend will continue in fiscal year our customers continue to move toward the term license model  which provides them with greater flexibility for product usage  including the option to share products between multiple locations and reconfigure tool use at regular intervals from a fixed product list 
as such  most of our customers have converted their existing installed base from perpetual to term licenses 
as a result of the ongoing shift from perpetual licenses to term licenses with upfront revenue recognition  which we view as a positive trend  we expect no significant impact to earnings  but a negative impact on cash flow and dso  as term licenses are 
table of contents generally paid over time 
as customers move away from perpetual licenses and into term licenses  the renewability and repeatability of our business is increased 
this provides opportunity for increased distribution of products earlier in their lifecycles 
product developments during the year ended december   we continued to execute our strategy of focusing on new problem areas encountered by customers  as well as building upon our well established product families 
we believe that customers  faced with leading edge design challenges  generally choose the best products in each category to build their design environment 
through both internal development and strategic acquisitions  we have focused on areas where we believe we can build a leading market position or extend an existing leading market position 
during the year ended december   we launched many new products  which are chronologically listed below first quarter in january  we launched calibre opcverify tm 
used after the design has been corrected for optical and process effects  the tool simulates the design of the mask across the lithographic process window helping ensure there are no significant yield detractors before committing to create an expensive mask set 
in march  we extended our move into ic process variation management with calibre lfd tm which permits designers to make tradeoffs to increase design resilience to process variation 
calibre mdp tm was also extended to offer a nanometer nm process version to handle the greatly increased complexity of mask preparation for ics at the nm process node 
calibre dfm tm technologies were also introduced into the common nm process platform 
second quarter in april  we released xtremear  a pcb routing product that improves the routing time of large designs 
this product allows improved designs by running more routing iterations during the design cycle 
in june  we launched catapult sl  a new version of our ansi c synthesis tool  which extends the tool from block level to multi block sub system design 
third quarter in july  we launched calibre drc  part of the new calibre nm platform 
calibre drc redefines the traditional design rule checking step to address ic design challenges at and below the nm process node 
in september  we announced the availability of the topology router  a tool that helps automate the layout of bus system interconnect on a pcb 
fourth quarter in october  we launched capital harnessxct  our next generation harness design solution for electrical wire harness design and engineering in transportation platforms 
in november  we unveiled calibre nmopc tm  a third generation optical proximity correction opc tool for sub nm process technologies 
we believe that the development and commercialization of eda software tools is usually a multi year process with limited customer adoption in the first years of tool availability 
once tools are adopted  however  their life spans tend to be long 
we believe that our relatively young and diverse product lines are positioned for growth over the long term 
financial performance for the year ended december  total revenues were  a increase over the year ended december   due to strength in all areas of business 
scalable verification  paced by digital and analog mixed signal and formal verification led our growth 
revenue strength in ic design to silicon was due to growth in the calibre family  while growth in integrated system design was from the pcb and fpga design product lines 
system and software revenues were  a increase over the year ended december  system and software revenues of  product revenue split by license model was term with upfront revenue recognition  perpetual and term with ratable revenue recognition which includes due and payable revenue recognition  compared to the year ended december  product revenue splits of term with upfront revenue recognition  perpetual and term with ratable revenue recognition 
term product revenue with upfront revenue recognition increased to  as compared to  in the year ended december  service and support revenues were  a increase over the year ended december  service and support revenues of  primarily due to growth in the installed base 
by geography  year over year revenues increased in the americas  decreased in europe and increased in pacific rim and in japan 
the americas contributed the largest share of revenues at nearly  up from for the year ended december  europe s share of revenues decreased to in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  japan and pacific rim regions increased their percentage of total revenues to and  respectively  in the year ended december  as compared to and  respectively  in the year ended december  net income for the year ended december  was  compared to a net income of  in the year ended december  improvement in earnings for the year resulted from growth in revenues during the year

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the accounting for revenue recognition  valuation of trade accounts receivable  valuation of deferred tax assets  income tax reserves  goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets  restructuring charges and accounting for stock based compensation are the critical accounting estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for further information on our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we report revenue in two categories based upon how the revenue is generated i system and software and ii service and support 
system and software revenues we derive system and software revenues from the sale of licenses of software products and emulation hardware products 
we primarily license our products using two different license types term licenses this license type is primarily used for software sales and provides the customer with a right to use a fixed list of software products for a specified time period  typically three years with payments spread over the license term  and do not provide the customer with the right to use the products after the end of the term 
term license arrangements may allow the customer to share products between multiple locations and reconfigure product usage from the fixed list of products at regular intervals during the license term 
product revenue from term license arrangements is generally recognized upon product delivery and start of the license term 
in a term license agreement where we provide the customer with rights to unspecified or unreleased future products  revenue is recognized ratably over the license term 
perpetual licenses this license type is used for both software and emulation hardware sales and provides the customer with the right to use the product in perpetuity and typically does not provide for extended payment terms 
product revenue from perpetual license arrangements is generally recognized upon product delivery 
service and support revenues service and support revenues consist of revenues from software and hardware post contract maintenance or support services and professional services  which include consulting services  training services and other services 
we record professional service revenue as the services are provided to the customer 
support services revenue is recognized ratably over the support services term 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all product revenue transactions where the software is not incidental 
we determine whether software product revenue recognition is appropriate based upon the evaluation of whether the following four criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists generally  we use the customer signed contract as evidence of an arrangement for term licenses 
for perpetual licenses  we use either a signed customer contract or a qualified customer purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
for professional service engagements  we may alternatively use a signed professional services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by an agreement governing the relationship  together with binding purchase orders from the distributor on a transaction by transaction basis 
delivery has occurred software and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers electronically 
electronic delivery occurs when we provide the customer access to the software 
we also will deliver the software on a compact disc where title is transferred to the customer upon shipment 
our software license agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance 
with respect to emulation hardware  title is transferred to the customer upon shipment 
we offer non essential installation services for emulation hardware sales or the customer may elect to perform the installation without assistance from us 
our emulation hardware product agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance 
fee is fixed or determinable we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement  primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we have established a history of collecting under the original contract with extended installment terms without providing concessions on payments  products or services 
additionally  for 
table of contents installment contracts  we determine that the fee is fixed or determinable if the arrangement has a payment schedule that is within the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments  when evaluated on a cumulative basis 
if the fee is not deemed to be fixed and determinable  revenue is recognized as payments are received  which is also defined as due and payable 
collectibility is probable to recognize revenue  we must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees on a customer by customer basis pursuant to a credit review policy 
we typically sell to customers with whom there is a history of successful collection 
we evaluate the financial position and a customer s ability to pay whenever an existing customer purchases new products  renews an existing arrangement or requests an increase in credit terms 
for certain industries for which our products are not considered core to the industry or the industry is generally considered troubled  we impose higher credit standards 
if we determine that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process or the customer s payment history  revenue is recognized as payments are received 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe our vsoe for certain product elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in comparable transactions when the element is sold separately 
vsoe for term and perpetual support services are primarily based upon customer renewal history where the services are sold separately 
vsoe for professional services are also based upon the price charged when the services are sold separately 
vsoe for installation services for emulation hardware systems is established based upon prices charged where the services are sold separately 
multiple element arrangements for multiple element arrangements  vsoe must exist to allocate the total fee among all delivered and non essential undelivered elements of the arrangement 
if undelivered elements of the arrangement are essential to the functionality of the product  revenue is deferred until the essential elements are delivered 
if vsoe does not exist for one or more non essential undelivered elements  revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements  or until all elements are delivered  whichever is earlier 
if vsoe of all non essential undelivered elements exists but vsoe does not exist for one or more delivered elements  revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the revenue for the undelivered elements is deferred based upon vsoe and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue for the delivered elements  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
if we could no longer establish vsoe for non essential undelivered elements of multiple element arrangements  revenue would be deferred until all elements are delivered or vsoe is established for the undelivered elements  whichever is earlier 
valuation of trade accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts on trade accounts receivable and term receivables  long term  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  such as in the case of bankruptcy or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  a specific reserve for bad debt is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount believed to be collectible 
we also record unspecified reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors including length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customers  the current business environment and historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be adjusted resulting in either additional selling expense or a reduction in selling expense in the period such determination was made 
valuation of deferred tax assets deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or decrease goodwill in the period such determination was made 
also  if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance on such net deferred tax assets would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made 
income tax reserves we have reserves for taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by taxing authorities  even though we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are appropriate 
the tax reserves are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in numerous foreign jurisdictions and in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we were issued notices of proposed adjustments nopas in august see provision for income taxes discussion in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion 

table of contents goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets we review long lived assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is determined by comparing its carrying amount to the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the asset relates 
if the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets  then long lived assets are written down to their estimated fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending upon the nature of the assets 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator using a fair value approach 
in the event that  in the future  it is determined that our goodwill  intangible or other long lived assets have been impaired  an adjustment would be made that would result in a charge for the write down in the period that determination was made 
restructuring charges we have recorded restructuring charges within special charges in the consolidated statements of operations in connection with our plans to better align the cost structure with projected operations in the future 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we record liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities when the liability is incurred 
we have recorded restructuring charges in connection with employee rebalances based on estimates of the expected costs associated with severance benefits 
if the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost  additional special charges will be recognized 
if the actual cost is less than the estimated cost  a benefit to special charges will be recognized 
we have also recorded restructuring charges in connection with excess leased facilities to offset future rent  net of estimated sublease income that could be reasonably obtained  of abandoned office space and to write off leasehold improvements on abandoned office space 
we work with external real estate experts in each of the markets where properties are located to obtain assumptions used to determine a reasonable estimate of the net loss 
our estimates of expected sublease income could change based on factors that affect our ability to sublease those facilities such as general economic conditions and the local real estate market 
if the real estate markets worsen and we are not able to sublease the properties as expected  additional adjustments may be required  which would result in additional special charges in the period such determination was made 
likewise  if the real estate market strengthens and we are able to sublease the properties earlier or at more favorable rates than projected  a benefit to special charges will be recognized 
accounting for stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments  such as stock options  for goods or services  such as the services of the entity s employees 
sfas r also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation transaction using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb and generally requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
accordingly  we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and recognize the expense over the employee s requisite service period using the modified prospective method 
the measurement of stock based compensation cost is based on several criteria including  but not limited to  the valuation model used and associated input factors such as expected term of the award  stock price volatility  dividend rate  risk free interest rate  and award cancellation rate 
the input factors to use in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment 
if there is a difference between the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining stock based compensation costs 
these changes may materially impact the results of operations in the period such changes are made

non cancelable lease payments on this excess leased facility space will be paid over eleven years 
in addition  we recorded costs of for non cancelable lease payments  net of sublease income  related to the abandonment of excess leased facility space in north america 
non cancelable lease payments on excess leased facility space in north america will be paid over four years 
in addition  we recorded in costs related to the restoration of a previously abandoned facility in europe 
in addition  during the year ended december  we recorded a benefit to special charges of due to the reversal of previously recorded non cancelable lease payments related to an abandoned facility in north america which has been sublet at a higher rate than the previously expected sublease income 
in addition to the rebalance of employees related to the discontinuation of a product line as described above  we rebalanced our workforce by employees during the year ended december  the reduction impacted several employee groups 
employee severance costs of  included severance benefits  notice pay and outplacement services 
the total rebalance charge represents the aggregate of numerous unrelated rebalance plans  none of which was individually material to our financial position or results of operations 
termination benefits were communicated to the affected employees prior to the end of the quarter in which the charge was recorded 
approximately half of these costs were paid during the year ended december   while the remainder of these costs was paid in the first half of the year ended december  there have been no significant modifications to the amount of these charges 
other costs in of include legal costs incurred to sever any ongoing obligation related to a defined benefit pension plan acquired in connection with an acquisition in the year ended december   terminated acquisitions costs  and other costs incurred to restructure the organization

table of contents excess leased facility costs of  in the year ended december  included  in adjustments to previously recorded non cancelable lease payments primarily for the lease of one facility in north america 
these adjustments were primarily a result of reductions to the estimated expected sublease income due to the real estate markets remaining at depressed levels longer than originally anticipated 
non cancelable lease payments on these excess leased facilities will be paid over six years 
we also recorded a write off of leasehold improvements for a facility lease in north america that was permanently abandoned 
in addition  we reversed related to the decision to utilize space that was previously abandoned for the lease of one facility in north america 
we acquired a defined benefit pension plan liability plan in connection with an acquisition in the year ended december  we made the plan dormant immediately after the acquisition  and then began the process to sever any ongoing obligation to the plan 
during this process  in the year ended december   a legally mandated actuarial evaluation was performed which indicated that the plan needed additional funding related to services rendered prior to the acquisition for which we received no benefit 
we recorded special charges of  in the year ended december  when this liability was determined 
other costs in the year ended december  of included costs incurred to restructure the organization other than employee rebalances and excess leased facility costs 
in addition  in we reversed of the remaining accrual related to the emulation litigation settlement with cadence design systems  inc in process research and development year ended december  change change in process research and development we incurred charges for in process research and development r d related to five  four and five acquisitions during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we use an independent third party valuation firm to assist us in determining the value of the in process r d acquired in our business acquisitions 
the value assigned to in process r d for the charges incurred in the years ended december   and related to research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established 
the value was determined by estimating the net cash flows from the sale of products resulting from the completion of such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
the rate used to discount the net cash flows was based on the weighted average cost of capital 
other factors considered were the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates from technology investments including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired in process technology  the useful life of the technology  the profitability levels of the technology and the stage of completion of the technology 
the stage of completion of the products at the date of the acquisition were estimated based on r d costs that had been expended as of the date of acquisition as compared to total r d costs expected at completion 
the percentages derived from this calculation were then applied to the net present value of future cash flows to determine the in process charge 
the nature of the efforts to develop the in process technology into commercially viable products principally related to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specification  including function  features and technical performance requirements 
the estimated net cash flows from these products were based on estimates of related revenues  cost of sales  r d costs  selling  general and administrative costs and income taxes 
these estimates are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur or that we will realize any anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
the risks associated with acquired r d are considered high and no assurance can be made that these products will generate any benefit or meet market expectations 
other income  net year ended december  interest income loss on sale of accounts receivable gain on sale of investments and property loss gain on hedge ineffectiveness foreign exchange loss gain other  net other income  net interest income includes amortization of the interest component of our term license installment agreements of   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income related to term license installment agreements was primarily attributable to i the increase in the average interest rates applied in determining the interest component for the outstanding term agreements during the applicable periods  and ii the acceleration of interest income associated with the sale of trade and term receivables 
in addition  we recorded income relating to the time value of foreign currency contracts of   and  in  and  respectively 
interest income also includes interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of   and  in  and  respectively 

table of contents the increase in the loss on sale of accounts receivable is the result of an increase in the sale of qualifying accounts receivable balances to certain financing institutions on a non recourse basis

we also reclassified a net loss of from accumulated other comprehensive income to hedge ineffectiveness for hedged transactions that failed to occur 
additionally  we determined that certain of our remaining derivative instruments did not meet the criteria for hedge accounting treatment under the requirements of sfas  resulting in the instruments being marked to market through the consolidated statement of operations and a net unrealized gain of  for the year ended december  other income  net was impacted by a foreign currency loss of in the year ended december  as compared to a foreign currency gain of in the year ended december  and a foreign currency loss of in the year ended december  due to fluctuations in currency rates 
interest expense year ended december  change change interest expense the increase in interest expense is due largely to the net effect of financing transactions  including the issuance of the convertible subordinated debentures due debentures in march  the retirement of the convertible subordinated notes due notes in march  and the retirement of portions of floating rate convertible subordinated debentures due floating rate debentures throughout the year  as more fully described in liquidity and capital resources below 
amounts recorded as interest expense related to these financing transactions include  for the call premium on the notes partially offset by repurchase discounts  net of premiums  of on the floating rate debentures in the year ended december  in addition  we recorded a charge of  in the year ended december  for the write off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs related to the notes and floating rate debentures 
the increase in interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  also included an increase of in debt interest expense due primarily to interest on the debentures and to higher average interest rates on the floating rate debentures 
we also recorded interest expense relating to the time value of foreign currency contracts of  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  effects of foreign currency fluctuations more than half of our revenues and approximately one third of our expenses were generated outside of the united states in the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  approximately one fourth of european and all japanese revenues were subject to exchange rate fluctuations as they were booked in local currencies 
most large european revenue contracts are denominated and paid to us in the united states dollar while our european expenses  including substantial research and development operations  are paid in local currencies causing a short position in the euro and the british pound 
in addition  we experience greater inflows than outflows of japanese yen as all japanese based customers contract and pay us in local currency 
while these exposures are aggregated on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets  substantial exposure remains 
for exposures that are not offset  we enter into short term foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset these anticipated exposures 
the option contracts are generally entered into at contract strike rates that are below current market rates 
as a result  any unfavorable currency movements below the original market rates and above the strike rates will not be offset by the foreign currency option contract and could negatively affect operating results 
these contracts address anticipated future cash flows for periods up to one year and do not hedge of the potential exposures related to these currencies 
as a result  the effects of currency fluctuations could have a substantial effect on our overall results of operations 
we discontinued certain hedges of japanese yen revenues during the year ended december  because it was probable that a portion of the original forecasted transactions would not occur 
as a result  we recognized a gain on hedge ineffectiveness of  we also reclassified a net loss of from accumulated other comprehensive income to hedge ineffectiveness for hedged transactions that failed to occur

generally  the provision for income taxes is the result of income tax imposed on the mix of profits losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates  withholding taxes primarily in certain foreign jurisdictions  and changes in tax reserves 
deferred tax assets consist of net operating loss carryforwards in several tax jurisdictions  including the united states  credit carryovers and timing differences between book and tax income 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  at a percent effective tax rate differs from tax computed at the federal statutory rate primarily due to i the benefit of lower tax rates on earnings of foreign subsidiaries offset in part by ii an increase in foreign tax reserves  iii withholding taxes primarily in certain foreign jurisdictions  and iv nondeductible incentive stock option  employee stock purchase plan and other executive compensation expense 
we have not provided for united states income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because they are considered permanently re invested outside of the united states 
at december   the cumulative amount of earnings upon which united states income taxes have not been provided is approximately  upon repatriation  some of these earnings would generate foreign tax credits which may reduce the federal tax liability associated with any future foreign dividend 
on october   the president signed the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act created a temporary incentive for united states corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends in the years ended december  and from controlled foreign corporations 
we decided not to repatriate foreign earnings pursuant to the act and accordingly  we have not adjusted our tax expense or liability to reflect any repatriation under the act 
in the year ended december   we declared a  dividend from a foreign subsidiary for which the provisions of the american jobs creation act of did not apply 
we incurred related tax expense of  net of associated foreign tax credits 
because we had sufficient net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to offset the tax liability for tax purposes  we incurred a federal cash tax liability of approximately  for alternative minimum tax and a state cash tax liability of approximately as a result of the dividend 
as of december   for federal income tax purposes  we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  foreign tax credits of  research and experimentation credit carryforwards of  alternative minimum tax credits of  and child care credits of as of december   for state income tax purposes  we had net operating loss carryforwards totaling  from multiple jurisdictions and research and experimentation and other miscellaneous state credits of  portions of our loss carryforwards  inherited through various acquisitions  are subject to annual limitations due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code 
if not used by us to reduce united states taxable income in future periods  portions of the net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through  the foreign tax credits will expire in through  research and experimentation credit carryforwards will expire between through and child care credits will expire between and the alternative minimum tax credits do not expire 
as of december   we have net operating losses in multiple foreign jurisdictions of  in general  the net operating losses for these foreign jurisdictions can be carried forward indefinitely 
in the year ended december   we transferred certain technology and other rights acquired from various acquisitions  including next device limited and spiratech limited  in intercompany transactions that resulted in approximately  of taxable gain for federal and state income tax purposes  resulting in of tax expense after the application of favorable tax attributes 
due to the intercompany nature of the transfers  this tax expense was capitalized as a deferred charge and will be amortized over a three year period including portions of four fiscal years 
the amortization of this deferred charge for the year ended december  was in the year ended december  we transferred certain technology rights acquired in the ati  ikos and innoveda acquisitions to one of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in a transaction that ultimately generated approximately  of taxable gain for federal and state income tax purposes  resulting in  in tax expense after the application of favorable tax attributes 
due to the intercompany nature of the transfer  this tax expense was capitalized as a deferred charge and amortized

the amortization of this deferred charge for the years ended december    and was    and  respectively 
there was no remaining balance of the deferred tax charge as of december  under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets without a valuation allowance if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
in the year ended december   we determined it was uncertain whether our united states entities would generate sufficient taxable income and foreign source income to utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards  research and experimentation credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards before expiration 
accordingly  we recorded valuation allowances in the years ended december   and against the portion of those deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain 
a portion of the valuation allowances for deferred tax assets relates to certain of the tax attributes acquired from ikos systems  inc and in design automation  inc  for which subsequently recognized tax benefits will be applied directly to reduce goodwill 
the remainder of the valuation allowance was based on the historical earnings patterns within individual taxing jurisdictions that make it uncertain that we will have sufficient income in the appropriate jurisdictions to realize the full value of the assets 
we will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
we had net deferred tax assets of  at december   an increase of  over the december  balance of  this increase was the result of a current year net increase in deferred tax assets and liabilities of  and an increase in the valuation allowance of  the net increase in gross deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily relates to an increase in accrued expenses and tax credit carryforwards offset in part by a decrease in the net operating loss carryforwards 
the increase in the valuation allowance primarily resulted from an increase in federal research tax credits for which realization is uncertain  offset in part by a decrease in the foreign valuation allowances and an increase in deferred liabilities related to acquired purchase technology 
our deferred tax assets as of december  and december  have been reduced to reflect the adoption of sfas r 
post adoption of sfas r  net operating loss carryforwards created by excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options are not recorded as deferred tax assets  if and when such net operating loss carryforwards are utilized  stockholders equity will be increased 
for presentation purposes we are also electing to exclude the historic deferred tax assets related to the excess tax benefits from stock option exercises 
deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards have been reduced by  and  as of december  and december   respectively 
as the deferred tax assets created by equity compensation are fully offset with valuation allowances  there were no changes to our deferred tax provision for any years presented 
we have reserves for taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by taxing authorities  even though we believe that the positions we have taken are appropriate 
the tax reserves are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in numerous foreign jurisdictions and in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in numerous foreign jurisdictions  and in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are currently under examination in various jurisdictions  including the united states  germany and the united kingdom 
the examinations are in different stages and timing of their resolution is difficult to predict 
the examination in the united states by the irs pertains to our  and tax years 
in august  the irs issued several notices of proposed adjustments nopas to us in which adjustments were proposed totaling  of additional taxable income for the three years 
the proposed adjustments primarily concern transfer pricing arrangements related to intellectual property rights acquired in acquisitions which were transferred to a foreign subsidiary 
we believe our positions have strong merit and we continue to dispute the proposed adjustment with the examination team 
we anticipate it will be necessary to elevate this matter within the irs to appeals 
we will continue to review new developments and the associated tax provision implications on an ongoing basis

in june  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf to clarify diversity in practice on the presentation of different types of taxes in financial statements 
the task force concluded that  for taxes within the scope of the issue  a company may adopt a policy of presenting taxes either gross within revenue or net 
that is  it may include charges to customers for taxes within revenues and the charge for the taxes from the taxing authority within cost of sales  or  alternatively  it may net the charge to the customer and the charge from the taxing authority 
if taxes subject to this issue are significant  a company is required to disclose its accounting policy for presenting taxes and the amounts of such taxes that are recognized on a gross basis 
the guidance in this consensus is effective for the first interim reporting period beginning after december  our current policy is to present the consolidated statement of operations net of taxes collected from customers 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf to result in a change to our accounting policy or have an effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements
