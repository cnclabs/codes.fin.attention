overview the company is a leading provider of antibody products and analytical test kits for a broad range of food  water  agricultural  industrial  environmental and scientific applications 
the company believes that its competitive position has been enhanced through the combination of talent  technology and resources resulting from the business development activities it has pursued since its inception 
the company has achieved meaningful economies of scale for the products it offers through the utilization of its consolidated facilities in newark  delaware  for the manufacture of test kits and antibodies and its facilities located in windham  maine and dallas  texas for the manufacture of antibodies 
the company believes that by applying its core competency of creating custom antibodies to assay development  the company produces unique  sophisticated diagnostic testing and reagent systems that are responsive to customer diagnostic and information needs 
customers benefit with quantifiable return on investment by reducing time  labor and or material costs associated with applications for which the company s products are used 
in addition  the company believes its tests provide high levels of accuracy  reliability and actionability of essential test results as compared to alternative products 
the company is focused on sustaining this competitive advantage by leveraging its expertise in immunology  proteomics  bio luminescence and other bio reactive technologies to continue its successful customer focused research and development efforts 
the company believes that an established product base  quality manufacturing expertise  experienced sales and marketing organization  established network of distributors  corporate partner relationships and proven research and development expertise will be critical elements of its potential future success 
in  the company continued the transition from having too many products and a fragmented marketing strategy to becoming a focused company  with proven  proprietary technologies tied directly to its customers needs 
the transition is most evident in the genomic antibody tm initiative and food pathogen detection products  where significant progress is being made 
the company continues to develop and introduce new methods for the detection of food pathogens that deliver a strong competitive advantage to its customers 
in  the company filed a patent for new technology to be used in proprietary enrichments of its food pathogen testing methods 
the patent covers technology for increasing the specificity and sensitivity of the company s immunoassay test methods 
the patent also makes claims for the application of the technology in large scale bio production bio fermentation processes  such as those used in the production of amino acids  ethanol  enzymes and other processes using microbiological production methods 
the company continued to develop multiple channels to market worldwide through an approach that includes direct sales  inside sales  distributors and agents 
the company increased distribution for its environmental products in eastern europe and asia where there is growing demand for environmental stewardship 
the company believes it is making progress in most of its business efforts  and as the deployment of new initiatives is accelerated  building on the company s leadership position in food pathogens and expanding its unique positioning in the emerging area of genomic antibodies  the company anticipates that the revenue lost to market changes in its legacy businesses will be replaced and the company will develop a stronger  more predictable  revenue base 
the company expects the genomic antibodies tm and food pathogen products to be its primary growth drivers in the future  and that the company s competencies and the competitive positions these two areas provide are the strongest in the company s history 
corporate and growth initiatives the following provides an update on the business development activities related to the genomic antibodies tm initiative and the new salmonella product in the food pathogen area  which utilizes a patent pending enrichment media technology 
genomic antibodies tm the company announced an initiative to develop technology for the high throughput production of genetic antibodies early in  and in january  opened a new facility for molecular biology and hired two scientists that had been leading the development of this technology 
in january  the company announced the commercial introduction of the lead product  mouse polyclonal antibodies  and the establishment of a new website  www 
genomicantibodies 
com 
in the same announcement  it was reported that beta tests had been successfully completed and the high throughput production processes for mouse polyclonal antibody reagents validated 
some of the other findings from these beta tests and the work that has taken place since the product s commercial launch are o the technology completely eliminates a customer s need to prepare and provide an antigen 
o an antibody that recognizes the user s target has been successfully produced  in the assay format the user chooses  of the time 
o the process is successfully producing antibodies to some of the most difficult research targets  including trans membrane proteins  membrane associated proteins  and other highly conserved proteins 
o a reagent is delivered to a customer in days or less 
this represents a saving of as much as when compared to the time required for delivery of antibody developed using traditional methods 
the antibody product group is strategically important to the growth of the company  and to transforming the company into a biotech company with much greater opportunities to access the human health market with proteomic tools and solutions 
with a relatively modest investment  and great speed  the company produced a platform technology with potential for new and greater value creation 
in the first quarter of we began commericialization of genomic antibodies tm 
salmonella product the new test for the detection of salmonella entered prototype evaluations in the first quarter of this test incorporates several new and proprietary technology advancements  and to date all planned prototype studies have been successfully completed with outstanding results 
this work has set the stage for entering beta test evaluations of the full method in the second quarter of  along with aoac validation 
the company had a full commercial launch in august one of the technologies that made the new salmonella product possible is the subject of a patent filed by the company during the fourth quarter of the patent claims the use of bacteria phage for the growth and detection of a target bacterium in an environment that is contaminated by competing and cross reacting bacteria 
this new technology solves the problem of singling out the harmful pathogen among many other bacteria by creating an optimized environment for rapid growth of the targeted pathogen while dramatically suppressing other competing bacteria or bacteria that can interfere with the fidelity of the test method 
this technology will be the subject of three papers accepted for presentation at the international association for food protection annual meeting in as the company experienced with its listeria test  superior accuracy  ease of use and lower cost in use should lead to rapid market acceptance 
other initiatives industrial bio processing the company believes that the same technology used in the salmonella product has application in other bio processing environments  including industrial bio processing 
there are many large scale industrial processes where a manufacturer is attempting to manage the yield of a production organism in an environment contaminated by competing bacteria 
these are applications like ethanol production  amino acid production  bio plastics  and others 
the company claims such application in our patent 
the company is currently working to demonstrate the application of these technologies in various industrial applications 
in we announced an agreement to develop a commercial application of this technology with broin industries  a major producer of ethanol in the united states 
water security the company is planning to increase spending associated with marketing efforts in support of the water quality products  specifically the microtox r and deltatox r technologies 
this investment follows the recent announcement that both platforms have received designation as an anti terror technology by the department of homeland security 
safety act designation allows users a safe harbor from liability associated with the use of the technology in the prevention  response or recovery from a terrorist action 
the company believes that this point alone focuses new attention on the preventative value of the technology 
the company has a robust new product pipeline with technology that provides sustainable differentiation to address larger markets 
sales and marketing professionals are being hired in anticipation of new product launches and the opportunities identified 
the company continues to be focused on key customers and prospects in target markets food  drinking water  pharma  in vitro diagnostics  and biotech 
continuously improving the efficiency of our manufacturing and supply chain processes and improving the overall quality of our products and service remains critical to success 
economic and industry wide factors o as industry continues to look for ways to reduce costs  the company believes there will be a continual shift from testing that requires highly trained personnel  expensive equipment and lengthy turnaround times for test results  to more rapid  accurate and cost effective testing which can be performed by less highly trained personnel and completed in minutes or hours 
o the global market for food pathogen testing continues to increase due to the globalization of the food supply  the establishment of harmonized quality standards  the consumer s desire for fresher  more ready to eat foods and foods from diverse geographies  and increasing regulatory and media scrutiny 
o the trend of increasing acceptance of gm crops and the introduction of new traits may drive additional demand for the company s products in order to maintain identity preservation and tracking 
o currently  the research tools portion of the biomarker and drug target discovery market is estimated to be between million and billion dollars  and is expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of more than over the next years to exceed billion dollars 
seasonality sales levels for certain agricultural products may be impacted by seasonal demand trends 
the demand for these test kits is typically higher in the first and third quarters due to harvesting patterns 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  revenues revenues for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to million for the same period in the following table sets out revenues by product category

the increased sales into foreign markets were partially offset by a decline in sales in the us domestic market during the comparable year period 
food safety products for the year ended december   food safety revenues were million  compared to million for  an increase of 
food safety revenues were million in the fourth quarter of  compared to million in the fourth quarter of  an increase of 
sales of tests for food pathogens grew from million to million when comparing the years ended december  and december  this increase is due primarily to increased sales of the company s tests for listeria which the company launched in mid since  sales of the company s product for the starlinkr trait have dropped from million to approximately  in the company expects sales of this product to ultimately cease entirely 
antibody products antibody revenues increased to million in the year ended december   compared to million for  and increased to million for the fourth quarter of  compared to million for the same quarter in the fourth quarter increase resulted from an increase in demand for monoclonal products and services  an increase in demand for bulk antibody products and deliveries of custom genomic antibodies tm projects 
management is encouraged by the overall increase in volume and margin but continues to recognize that the bulk monoclonal and polyclonal segments of the business have inconsistent order patterns and may produce periodic spikes in revenue 
overall  production capacity and utilization of production capacity increased in  a trend that is expected to continue 
other areas gross profit for the year ended december  totaled million  as compared to million for gross margins were for both years presented 
for the year ended december   operating expenses increased to million  compared to million in the same period in for the year ended december   research and development spending was million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues  for this decrease was primarily the result of approximately  in spending during related to upgrades to the microtox r equipment software 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for this increase is primarily attributable to marketing efforts utilized to launch the genomic antibodies tm product and the cost of a detailed review of the company s business and opportunities for growth by an outside consulting group 
interest  net the company recorded interest income of  during compared to interest income of  during this increase is primarily due to increased interest rates received on invested funds in pre tax income totaled  for the year ended december   compared to  for income taxes the company s annual effective tax rate of for primarily reflects the federal statutory rate of  state income taxes net of us federal benefit of and research and development credits of 
net income for the year ended december  was  or per diluted share  compared to  or per diluted share  for diluted shares totaling million and million were used in the computations for and  respectively

food safety revenues were million in the fourth quarter of  compared to million in the fourth quarter of  an increase of 
these increases were driven by food pathogen test sales in both the fourth quarter of and the year ended december   which were up and  respectively  compared to the same periods of antibody products antibody revenues increased to million in the year ended december   compared to million for  but decreased to million for the fourth quarter of  compared to million for the same quarter in the decline in the fourth quarter was primarily due to a cyclical reduction in demand for bulk antibodies  as well as a reduction in new projects for custom monoclonal antibody production 
in  the company recorded revenue totaling approximately  associated with the sale of previously written off inventories that represented the company s discontinued catalog in bulk polyclonal antibodies 
other areas gross profit for the year ended december  totaled million  as compared to million for gross margins were for and for for the year ended december   operating expenses increased to million  compared to million in the same period in  partially due to research expenses incurred of  related to the company s investment in the commercialization of new technologies and high throughput production of antibodies and the investment in a software upgrade for the microtox r equipment totaling  for the year ended december   research and development spending was million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues  for selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for in  the company recorded approximately  of costs related to the previously announced restatement of prior years financial statements as a result of a determination by the company  following discussions with the us securities and exchange commission  to revise its revenue recognition policy for custom antibody projects 
interest  net the company recorded interest income of  during compared to interest income of  during primarily due to higher levels of invested cash when comparing to pre tax income totaled  for the year ended december   compared to million for income taxes the company s annual effective tax rate of for primarily reflects the federal statutory rate of  foreign net operating losses not previously benefited of and research and development credits of 
net income for the year ended december  was  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for diluted shares totaling million and million were used in the computations for and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet the company s obligations and commitments  or obtain appropriate financing 
currently our liquidity needs arise primarily from debt service on indebtedness  working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
the following is a summary of selected cash flow information year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided by financing activities  effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase in cash and cash equivalents  the net cash provided by operating activities of million and million for and  respectively  was primarily the result of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the periods ending december  and of million in each period 
see non gaap financial measures below 
net cash used in investing activities in of million compares to net cash used in investing activities of million for these cash outflows were primarily the result of capital purchases which totaled million in versus million in the capital expenditures for primarily relate to manufacturing and lab equipment purchases 
the capital expenditures for primarily relate to investments in a parcel of land adjacent to our antibody manufacturing facility in maine 
net cash provided by financing activities of  for and million for was primarily driven by proceeds from the exercise of stock options  which was partially offset by net repayments of outstanding debt 
the company s working capital current assets less current liabilities increased approximately million to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to the increase of  in cash and cash equivalents generated during the period 
outstanding debt decreased  from  at december  to  on december   due to scheduled repayments 
on may   the company entered into a financing agreement with a commercial bank 
this agreement provides for up to a million revolving line of credit  none of which was outstanding and approximately million of which was available at december   based on eligible assets 
the revolving line of credit bears a variable interest rate of between and over libor depending upon the ratio of the company s funded debt to ebitda  and is subject to a borrowing base determined by the company s eligible accounts receivable 
the company s annual effective rate of interest on this line of credit  taking into account the variable interest rate and libor  was approximately at december  on december   the company entered into an agreement with a commercial bank to finance the construction of new facilities at its windham  maine location 
this agreement provided for up to million in financing   of which was outstanding at december   and is repayable over seven years  with principal payments that began on october  the loan bears a variable interest rate of between and over libor depending upon the ratio of the company s funded debt to ebitda 
payments are due monthly  with equal amortization of principal payments plus interest 
the company s annual effective rate of interest on this loan at december   was approximately 
under the terms of the above financing  the company is required to meet certain quarterly financial covenants that include a ratio of ebitda to current maturities of debt plus interest and cash paid for taxes greater than and a ratio of funded debt to ebitda not to exceed 
at december   the company met all of its financial covenants with respect to this indebtedness 
for the year ended december   the company satisfied all of its cash requirements from the net cash provided by operating activities  cash available and on hand and from the financing agreements described above 
at december   the company had  in long term debt and stockholders equity of million 
although the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures at december   it does anticipate that it may spend approximately million in to upgrade or expand certain manufacturing  research and development and office systems 
non gaap financial measures the company presents an ebitda measure as the company believes this provides investors and the company s management with additional information to measure the company s liquidity 
ebitda measures are not a measure of performance under gaap and  therefore  should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or cash flows from operations 
additionally  the company s ebitda calculations may differ from the ebitda calculations for other companies 
the calculation of the company s ebitda measure as discussed above  and the reconciliation of the company s ebitda measure to net cash provided by operating activities for years ended december  and  respectively  is as follows amounts in thousands twelve months ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities   changes in assets and liabilities receivables inventories other current assets other assets accounts payable accrued expenses deferred revenue net change in deferred income tax loss on disposal of fixed assets stock compensation expense interest income  net ebitda   off balance sheet arrangements as of december  the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
contractual obligations the company is committed to making cash payments in the future on two types of contracts our long term indebtedness and leases 
the company has no off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations 
below is a schedule of the future payments that the company was obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  caption payments due by year and beyond total in thousands

see discussion in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long term debt 
see discussion of operating leases in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
based upon its cash on hand  credit facilities  current product sales and the anticipated sales of new products  the company believes it has  or has access to  sufficient resources to meet its operating requirements at least through the next months 
the company s ability to meet its long term capital needs will depend on a number of factors  including compliance with existing and new loan covenants  the success of its current and future products  the focus and direction of its research and development program  competitive and technological advances  future relationships with corporate partners  government regulation  the company s marketing and distribution strategy  its successful sale of additional common stock and or the company successfully locating and obtaining other financing  and the success of the company s plan to make future acquisitions 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to meet the long term liquidity requirements that may arise from these inherent and similar uncertainties 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  deferred taxes and long lived assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the consolidated results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
valuation of accounts receivable accounts receivable as of december  and december   were net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively 
the recorded allowance is continually evaluated based on current market conditions  an analysis of customer specific facts and circumstances  and the size and composition of the overall portfolio 
if receivables become uncollectible  these write offs are charged against the allowance 
valuation of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
for inventories that consist primarily of test kit components  bulk antibody serum and antibody products  cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
realization of inventories is dependent upon the successful marketing of our products 
judgments are made regarding the carrying value of inventory based on current market conditions 
market conditions may change depending upon competitive product introductions and customer demand 
if market conditions change or if the introduction of new products by the company impacts the market for previously released products  the company may be required to write down the cost of its inventory 
for inventories that consist of costs associated with the production of custom antibodies  cost is determined using the specific identification method 
realization of such inventories is dependent upon the successful completion of a project in accordance with customer specifications 
losses on projects in progress are recorded in the period such losses become likely and estimable 
deferred taxes in assessing the realizablity of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of existing temporary differences  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  at december   management concluded that no valuation allowance is necessary for federal deferred tax assets after considering the positive and negative factors 
in making this determination  the company considered the following positive evidence o positive net income before taxes in each of the last three years  o income before taxes of million for the six month period ended december   o cumulative income before taxes of million over the three years ended december   o use of annual election to capitalize research and experimentation expenses under irs code e  which will then be amortized over a ten year period  o past and anticipated new product launches  and o the operating efficiencies gained and to be gained from automating labor intensive manufacturing processes and improvements to supply chain management 
the company also considered the following negative factors o the income before taxes was lower than expectations  and o federal net operating loss carry forwards begin to expire in at december   management has concluded that a full valuation allowance is necessary for deferred tax assets in certain state jurisdictions 
for the state jurisdictions  management has considered the same positive and negative evidence as utilized for the federal deferred tax assets described above 
the company has also considered the substantial reduction of its presence in north carolina and pennsylvania since the time when the net operating losses were incurred in those jurisdictions as additional negative evidence 
at december   the company had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes related to foreign operations in the united kingdom uk 
management considered positive and negative indicators in concluding that a substantial valuation allowance of million was necessary for the foreign deferred tax assets of million 
the positive indicators included the contribution to income before taxes by the foreign operations in the uk for and  and the expected income before taxes in the uk for the negative indicators include a history of substantial net operating losses in the uk  the lack of income before taxes until and limitations with regard to estimating income in the uk beyond resulting from the rebuilding and expansion of the uk distributor network 
the net operating loss carryforwards differ from the accumulated deficit  principally due to differences in the timing of recognition of certain research and development expenses  depreciation and amortization  other non deductible reserves and limitations under federal and state regulations for acquired net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards  including those acquired in the company s past acquisitions  of approximately million  which  if not utilized  begin to expire as follows amount of nol year in thousands   total  based on the best information available to the company today  the company expects to have sufficient future taxable income to utilize such nols prior to the expiration of the us net operating loss carry forwards 
revenue recognition revenues composed of sales of immunoassay based test kits and certain antibodies and immunochemical reagents are recognized upon the shipment of the product and transfer of title or when related services are provided 
revenues associated with such products or services are recognized when persuasive evidence of an order exists  shipment of product has occurred or services have been provided  the price is fixed and determinable and  collectibility is probable 
management is required to make judgments based on actual experience about whether or not collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company enters into contracts related to the production of custom antibodies  which provide for the performance of defined tasks for a fixed price  with delivery of the product upon completion of production 
the standard time to complete a project is typically longer than days but less than months and effort is expended over the life of the project 
revenues related to sales of custom antibody projects are recognized when a project s specifications have been met and or the related materials have been shipped 
fees associated with products and services added on to a custom antibody project subsequent to delivery of the initial project are billed monthly and recognized as revenue as the services and other deliverables are provided 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds an asset s fair value 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r 
sfas r requires the company to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and recognize such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  sfas r requires additional accounting related to the income tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from stock based payment arrangements 
we adopted sfas r on january  using the modified prospective transition method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning january  for all stock based awards granted on or after that date and for all awards granted to employees prior to january  that remain unvested on that date 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized in fiscal includes a compensation cost for all stock based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  as adjusted for an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited and b compensation cost for all stock based awards granted on or after january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
previously  we had recognized the impact of forfeitures as they occurred 
the grant date fair value of the awards generally vests over the service period 
the stock based compensation expense is included in sg a expenses 
sfas r requires management to make estimates and assumptions to determine the underlying value of stock options and restricted stock awards  including the vesting for restricted stock awards and options containing performance based vesting features  the expected term of stock options  an estimate of future forfeitures and the volatility of our stock price in the future 
these assumptions have an impact on the valuation assigned to equity awards and the associated recognition of expense 
on december   the board of directors of the company approved the accelerated vesting  effective as of december   of all unvested stock options granted to employees and non employee directors from through under the company s stock incentive plan  as well as options granted to the company s chief executive officer under his original employment agreement 
the acceleration of vesting of these options reduced non cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in the company s income statement in and future periods in anticipation of the adoption of sfas r in january the board s decision was based on such factors as of the options were out of the money  the options generally vested over the next three years  and  the company has decided to rely  to a substantial degree  on restricted stock as opposed to options in future incentive compensation awards 
new accounting standards and disclosures in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab provides guidance on the consideration of effects of the prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
the sec staff believes registrants must quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab is effective for the first annual period ending after november   which is our fiscal report 
for  the application of sab had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurements 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and is intended to respond to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which a company measures assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on income 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances 
sfas also requires expanded disclosure of the effect on income for items measured using unobservable data  establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions and requires separate disclosure by level within the fair value hierarchy 
the provisions of sfas are effective for interim financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   or the company s fiscal the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
on the consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return 
the company must determine whether it is at least more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the effect adoption of fin will have on the consolidated financial statements of the company
