the year ended december  includes pre tax charges that consist of the following restructuring charge of million  goodwill and other asset impairment charge of million  inventory charge of million  a million deferred tax valuation allowance and million in stock compensation charges and related payroll taxes primarily related to the employer match of our deferred compensation plan 
the year ended december  includes a write down of approximately million  included in other expense  to reduce the book value of an investment held in a privately owned enterprise and a restructuring charge of million for a reduction in force and accruals related to an excess facility 
on february   we acquired di dt inc the purchase price for di dt was approximately million  which consisted of the following a million note receivable from  as well as a million cost basis investment in  di dt prior to the acquisition  million shares of the company s common stock valued at million at acquisition  million in cash and acquisition costs  and million shares of the company s common stock paid as earn out to the former shareholders of di dt during and valued at million 
earn out payments have been recorded as additional goodwill  and no earn out provisions extended beyond december  in addition to the purchase price  the company granted a cash bonus of approximately million to the original founders of di dt upon acquisition  which was recorded as compensation expense in during  we performed an impairment test in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
the results of these tests indicated that the manufacturing equipment at one of our european facilities was impaired and we recorded non cash impairment charges of million 
in addition  we wrote down our mexico building to fair value based on current market activity resulting in non cash impairment charges of million 
we also recorded a million write off of an investment we own in a privately held technology company  which was recorded in other expense 
the year ended december  also includes pre tax restructuring charges of million related to severance and benefit payments  consolidation of excess facilities  contract termination costs  and other shutdown costs  in accordance with sfas and million of restructuring charges for settlement payments and legal fees related to additional personnel and legal costs resulting from the closure of the boston  massachusetts facility during during  we announced a restructuring plan which was accounted for in accordance with sfas we recorded pre tax charges of million for restructuring costs which included a workforce reduction in europe and north america  and the charges were comprised of severance and related benefits  consolidation of excess facilities and continuing lease obligations thereon  contract termination costs  and other shutdown costs 
during  we also performed impairment reviews in accordance with sfas as a result  we identified certain long lived assets associated with the restructuring whose carrying value would not be recoverable from future cash flows  and recorded an impairment charge of million for these assets for the year ended december  these assets consisted of an owned building in norway that was held for use and which was written down to fair market value and then sold in  leasehold improvements for leased facilities whose operations were closed during the year  and miscellaneous other long lived assets that will no longer be used 
we also determined that an investment in a foreign enterprise  recorded in other assets on the balance sheet  was impaired 
the impairment charge of million was recorded in other expense and primarily resulted from a forecast reduction for the enterprise and the related cash flow

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements certain statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis md a  including  without limitation  statements containing the words may  will  can  anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  continue  and similar expressions constitute forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including risks described in the risk factors sections and elsewhere in this filing 
except for our ongoing obligation to disclose material information as required by federal securities laws  we do not intend to update you concerning any future revisions to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the risk factors as well as our financial statements and the related notes 
introduction we are a worldwide organization and leading designer and manufacturer of hundreds of high quality brand name ac dc and dc dc power supplies and converters and power management products 
we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers  distributors and service providers who value quality  reliability  technology and service 
we have hundreds of customers in the communications  networking equipment  server storage  computer  instrumentation  industrial  and other electronic equipment industries 
our ac dc power supplies are typically embedded in our customers products and convert alternating current to direct current 
our board mounted dc dc products provide precise levels of dc power to sensitive electronic components embedded in our customers equipment 
our power management products also provide precise levels of dc power to sensitive electronic components  but include elements of communications and control 
in addition  our power management products are programmable via a graphical user interface and offer our customers significant cost and time savings over traditional dc dc converters 
our dc power systems  which provide back up power  are sold primarily to telecommunications and internet service providers worldwide 
in february  we implemented a restructuring plan wherein we consolidated our division structure 
the most significant components of this activity involved the elimination of most dc power systems operations in norway and their integration into our other existing lower cost locations  as well as the elimination of certain manufacturing operations in north america and subsequent transfer of the manufacturing to our other existing lower cost locations or to contract manufacturers 
we incurred million of restructuring and asset impairment charges during  of which approximately million were non cash in nature and primarily related to asset impairment charges for long lived assets 
the balance of the charges related to severance and continuing lease obligations for closed facilities  the longest of which continues into in october we completed the acquisition of the power electronics group subsidiary of magnetek  inc for approximately million plus the assumption of approximately million in debt 
we financed this acquisition with a million term loan and million of cash and investments 
the term loan matures months from the date it was made and carries an interest rate of through october at an interest rate of from october until maturity 
the power electronics group is primarily engaged in the design  manufacture and sale of custom ac dc products to original equipment manufacturers oems and provides us with enhanced capability in the custom ac dc power supply market  a talented workforce of design engineers located in europe  and an established low cost manufacturing facility in china  all of which we expect will enable us to reduce our overall component and manufacturing costs and broaden our product line and product capabilities 
due to the mix of custom products produced by the power electronics group for higher volume applications  they tend to generate lower gross margins than we have traditionally seen experienced 
we have two main product lines  referred to as embedded products and power systems 
embedded products include ac dc power supplies  dc dc converters including brick converters and pol converters  alternative energy  and smart motor control products 
power systems products include dc power systems 
our silicon power systems sps group is strategically significant to the company and is engaged in the design and production of highly innovative and efficient silicon based digital power management solutions for next generation dc dc power conversion products in the intermediate bus architecture iba market 
sps maxyz product line was introduced in and was developed specifically for the iba market 
in  we introduced our new z one digital power management architecture and our new z series product line which included a digital controller 
we began full production of these products near the end of the third quarter of c d technologies is a second source licensing partner for these products 
we have continued to strengthen our z one alliance by announcing the addition of atmel and micrel to the partnership during and by establishing a z alliance website at www 
z alliance 
org 
during the first quarter of  we introduced the z no bus family of digital point of load converters  which provides customers with digital power conversion without requiring a change in architecture 
in  we introduced the second generation of digital power managers  which can control non power one products on the customers printed circuit boards 
in response to our new technology  certain of our competitors formed a consortium in an attempt to develop competing technologies 
we filed a lawsuit on september  against artesyn technologies  inc and on december  against silicon laboratories  inc for infringement of patents held by the company related to this technology 
the lawsuit against silicon laboratories  inc was settled in and the settlement included silicon laboratories  inc joining the z one alliance and allowed for certain technological collaborations 
the remaining lawsuit against artesyn technologies  inc seeks compensatory damages and a permanent injunction to prohibit them from making  using  selling or offering to sell infringing products 
we expect to reach the jury trial portion of this lawsuit during the summer of we have spent and anticipate spending significant capital on r d related to this developing area of power management technology  but there can be no assurance that the market will accept the resulting technology or that we will recover our investment in this technology through sales of new products 
the costs related to defending our patents and intellectual property may be material to our results of operations 
in may  the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million in shares of our common stock with the intent to retire the shares 
this authorization expired on december  as of december   we had repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
we generate a significant percentage of our revenue internationally through sales offices located throughout europe and asia 
in addition  manufacturing is performed in our own facilities in the dominican republic  china  italy and slovakia  and at contract manufacturers in asia 
approximately of our products are manufactured by our contract manufacturers 
we are significantly increasing our presence in asia to take advantage of a lower cost structure and closer proximity to certain major customers 
however  we recognize that there are inherent risks to our international operations that may impact our business  which include but are not limited to the following currency risk  since we will increasingly receive payments and purchase components in foreign currencies and we have historically not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities  risk associated with expanding sales or manufacturing operations into economies and markets that may experience financial or political instability  differing degrees of intellectual property protection outside of the united states  frequent changes in laws and policies affecting trade  investment and taxes  including laws and policies relating to repatriation of funds and to withholding taxes  that are administered under very different judicial systems  reliance on overseas contract manufacturers that may not be able to manufacture and deliver products in the quantity  quality and timeline required  and additional time constraints on management associated with overseeing an increased number of operations that are geographically dispersed across asia 
we are subject to local laws and regulations in various regions in which we operate  including the european union eu 
one such law is the restriction of certain hazardous substances directive rohs  which restricts the distribution of certain substances  including lead  within the eu and became effective on july  in addition to eliminating and or reducing the level of specified hazardous materials from our products  we are also required to maintain and publish a detailed list of all chemical substances in our products 
we believe that we have substantially complied with this directive and do not believe this directive poses a material risk to our business 
we operate in an industry where quantity discounts  price erosion and corresponding decreases in revenues and margins  and product obsolescence due to technological improvements are normal 
while we see price erosion on most of the products we sell  we also see price erosion on many of the components we purchase for inclusion in our products  thereby decreasing our costs 
product obsolescence refers to the tendency of small and less expensive products to replace larger and more expensive products 
for example  the functions of a full size dc dc brick converter were replaced by a half brick  which was subsequently replaced by a quarter brick and then a th brick  and this will eventually be replaced by a th brick or even smaller product 
each successive product is smaller but has retained or expanded the functionality of its predecessor 
in addition to the reduction in size  the dollar cost per watt is also reduced  which results in lower prices for the customer as well as lower cost for the manufacturer 
sales of each successor product typically replace sales of the predecessor product  making the predecessor product obsolete 
these phenomena are normal in our industry  and we have experienced price erosion and product obsolescence in line with industry trends 
price erosion and product obsolescence may negatively impact gross margins  and price erosion may also mask increases in unit sales as opposed to revenues of certain products 
critical accounting policies application of our accounting policies requires management to make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments  although differing amounts may be reported if there are changes in the assumptions and estimates 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory allowances  restructuring costs  impairment charges  depreciation and amortization  business combinations  and sales returns 
management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to an understanding of our financial statements and as areas most dependent on management s judgment and estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title transfer has occurred  the price is fixed or readily determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
sales are recorded net of sales returns and discounts  which are estimated at the time of shipment based upon historical data 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment or at the time of inventory consumption for customers on vendor managed inventory vmi programs because this is the point at which revenue is earned and realizable and the earnings process is complete 
for most shipments  title to shipped goods transfers at the shipping point  so the risks and rewards of ownership transfer once the product leaves our warehouse 
for shipments in which title transfers at a later date  revenue recognition is delayed 
revenue is only recognized when collectibility is reasonably assured 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold 
we may charge shipping and handling costs to customers  which are included in revenue 
we offer our distributors a standard agreement which includes payment terms  description of rights to return or exchange product  and price discounts 
under our standard agreement  payment is due within days of shipment of the product to the distributors 
the distributor has a right to return only if we discontinue a product that the distributor has on hand 
the distributor has a right to exchange up to of the dollar value of products purchased within the prior six month period  so long as the distributor is currently purchasing at least the equivalent dollar value in new product 
estimated product exchanges or returns are accrued for at the time of the sale based on historical information in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
finally  we may give price discounts to a distributor at the time a purchase order is received from the distributor for product that they will sell to a specific customer 
the price discount is available for one year following issuance of the purchase order for items listed on the purchase order 
we accrue for the estimated price discount at the time revenue is recognized 
we have a joint venture in asia which  along with certain of our contract manufacturers  may purchase raw components and other goods from power one  and sell finished goods back to power one as well as to other third parties 
we record revenue on sales to the joint venture and contract manufacturer only when the components and goods are for sales to third parties 
when the joint venture or contract manufacturer purchases components that will be assembled and sold back to us  no revenue is recorded because the earnings process has not been completed 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we review the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets using the methodology prescribed in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
upon such an occurrence  recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows to which the assets relate  to the carrying amount 
if the asset is determined to be unable to recover its carrying value  it is written down to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows  appraised values or other information available in the market  depending on the nature of the assets 
methodologies for determining fair value are inherently based on estimates that may change  such as the useful lives of assets and our cash flow forecasts associated with certain assets 
a change in these estimates may result in impairment charges  which would impact our operating results 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets using the methodology prescribed in sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that we not amortize goodwill  but instead subject it to impairment tests on at least an annual basis and whenever circumstances suggest that goodwill may be impaired 
these impairment tests are also dependent on management s forecasts  which frequently change 
a change in our forecasts may result in impairment charges 
restructuring costs we record restructuring charges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with disposal activities  which requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  in contrast to the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
restructuring costs were related to the downsizing of operations and primarily consisted of specific charges that had been incurred or were to be incurred with no future economic benefit 
these charges included costs related to personnel severance  continuing lease obligations for vacant facilities  and certain contract termination penalties and other shutdown costs 
calculation of the restructuring reserves includes management s judgment regarding closed facilities  which include assumptions about the length of time it will take for facilities to be subleased as well as the likely sublease income amount 
changes in these estimates may impact our operating results 
deferred income tax asset valuation allowance we record a deferred income tax asset in jurisdictions where the company generates a loss 
we also record a valuation allowance against these deferred income tax assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  when  in management s judgment  it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
slow moving and obsolete inventory are written down quarterly based on a comparison of on hand quantities to historical and projected usages 
additionally  reserves for non cancelable open purchase orders for components we are obligated to purchase in excess of projected usage  or for open purchase orders where the market price is lower than the purchase order price  are recorded as other accrued expenses on the balance sheet 
calculation of inventory write downs is based on management s assumptions regarding projected usage of each component  which are subject to changes in market demand 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we establish the allowance for doubtful accounts using the specific identification method and also provide a reserve in the aggregate 
our estimates for calculating the aggregate reserve are based on historical information 
any changes to our assumptions or estimates may impact our operating results 
business combinations we account for our acquisitions utilizing the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method of accounting  the total consideration paid is allocated to the underlying assets and liabilities  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
determining the fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities  identifiable intangible assets in particular  is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to estimates of revenue growth rates  estimates of rates of return  royalty rates  and determination of appropriate discount rates 
these assumptions are generally made based on available historical information 
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives 
recent pronouncements and accounting changes in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas no also includes an amendment to sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities which applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we are assessing the impact of sfas no 
and have not determined whether it will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
the statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements  and does not require any new fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the statement is effective for the fiscal years beginning after november  we are assessing the impact of sfas no 
and have not determined whether it will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
the interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
specifically  the pronouncement prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on the related derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting for interim periods  disclosure and transition of uncertain tax positions 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are assessing fin and have not determined the impact that the adoption of fin will have on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the years ended december  and represent week years and the year ended december  represents a week year 
the following table represents our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods presented fiscal year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expense engineering and quality assurance expense amortization of intangibles restructuring costs asset impairment loss from operations interest income interest expense other income expense  net loss before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss comparison of fiscal year ended december  with fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in sales was attributable to our acquisition of the power electronics group during the fourth quarter of as well as organic volume growth in sales across all product lines 
included in the results for the year ended december  is weeks of activity related to the power electronics group  or million of net sales 
we announced several significant new customers during in the server storage industry and saw particular strength in existing customers in the communications  computer retail  and transportation industries 
net sales for our two product lines were as follows  in millions year ended december  year ended december  embedded products power systems total net sales by customer category were as follows  in millions year ended december  year ended december  oems distributors service providers total cisco systems and its contract manufacturers collectively were the only customer to exceed of net sales in either of the years ended december  or with million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  in each respective year 
because of the acquisition of the power electronics group during the fourth quarter of  we have redefined our end markets and reclassified certain customers 
net sales for the years ended december  and by end markets under this new classification were as follows year ended december  communications instrumentation and industrial server  storage and computer other total our combined year end day and day backlog were as follows  in millions year ended december  year ended december  combined day backlog combined day backlog we generally sell our products pursuant to purchase orders rather than long term contracts 
backlog consists of purchase orders on hand having delivery dates scheduled within the next six months 
customers may cancel or reschedule most deliveries without penalty 
our backlog may not necessarily be a reliable indicator of future revenue both because we do not maintain long term contracts with our customers so they are free to cancel or modify their orders and also because a significant portion of our revenues derives from turns business that is  revenues from orders that are booked and shipped within the same reporting period and that therefore do not appear as backlog at the end of a reporting period 
the day and day backlog of the newly acquired entity on december  was million and million  respectively 
the increase in backlog is primarily a result of our acquisition of the power electronics group during the fourth quarter of since the power electronics group is primarily engaged in the design  manufacture and sale of ac dc products that are customized to the particular customer  lead times are longer and orders are booked earlier than they would be for standard products 
as such  the backlog for the products of the power electronics group was  and we expect it to continue to be  higher than for our other products 
our bookings were not significantly impacted by any new vendor managed inventory vmi programs during when customers adopt our vmi program  they no longer place orders with us and instead use an automated forecasting model 
we then manufacture products for the customer based on their forecast  and the customer uses the inventory as needed 
as a result  under a vmi program  the booking and billing occur simultaneously upon use of the product  and therefore there is always a book to bill ratio of for these programs 
we may bring additional vmi programs on line in the future  which would result in higher turns business  lower backlog  and higher finished goods inventory 
as such  we believe that backlog may not necessarily be a reliable indicator of future results 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million compared with a gross profit of million for the year ended december  our gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  from a gross margin of for the same period in the decrease in gross margin during the year ended december  was primarily because of the write up of finished goods and work in process inventory of the newly acquired business  in accordance with purchase accounting rules  that were subsequently sold at an increased basis  as well as an overall shift in product mix toward higher volume and lower margin products 
in addition to the shift toward lower margin products in the embedded product line in  the products of the power electronics group generally carry gross margins lower than power one s historical consolidated gross margin 
during the year ended december   we incurred additional costs related to quality issues at one of our contract manufacturers 
we also recorded million in cost of goods sold related to the write off of excess inventory and other inventory adjustments during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the gross margin of the power electronics group was for the weeks of activity in the year ended december   which included a million fair market value write up of finished goods and work in process inventory 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in selling expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the power electronics group s selling expense recorded for the weeks of activity in the year ended december  was million 
the increase in selling expenses during the year ended december  was primarily due to the additional expense incurred by the power electronics group for the weeks they were included as part of the company  as well as increased commissions and bonus expense due to the increase in product revenue during administrative expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for year ended december  the increase of million was primarily related to the weeks of activity of the power electronics group in the year ended december  which was million 
engineering and quality assurance expense 
engineering and quality assurance expense increased million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  engineering and quality assurance expense decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the power electronics group incurred million of engineering and quality assurance expenses related to the weeks of activity in the year ended december  engineering expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in quality assurance expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increases in engineering and quality assurance expense were primarily due to expense incurred by the power electronics group during the fourth quarter of amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was due to million of amortization of intangibles resulting from the acquisition of the power electronics group during the fourth quarter of which was mostly offset by a million decrease in amortization expense due to certain intangible assets reaching the end of their amortizable lives 
restructuring charge during fiscal year ended december  at december   we evaluated our remaining restructuring reserves and increased our reserves by million due to increases in certain continuing lease obligations 
loss from operations 
as a result of the items above  loss from operations decreased million to a loss of million for the year ended december  from an operating loss of million for the same period in interest income expense  net 
net interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to net interest income of million for the same period in the decrease in net interest income primarily resulted from the use of million of our cash to finance a portion of the acquisition of the power electronics group in the fourth quarter of additionally  we borrowed million in term debt with an initial interest rate of to finance the acquisition 
the power electronics group incurred million of interest expense during the week period in the year ended december  related to credit facility and long term debt obligations 
other income expense  net 
net other expense was million for the year ended december   compared with net other income of million for the year ended december  net other expense during included million in net losses related to foreign currency fluctuations  million of realized loss on the sale of held to maturity securities that were sold prior to their maturity dates and million in impairment losses related to an available for sale investment that experienced a decline in value that we deemed to be other than temporary in accordance with fasb staff position fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the impairment loss was equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value as of december  provision for income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes was million for the year ended december  compared to a provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december  the benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  included approximately million related to a foreign tax refund and million related to a favorable european tax ruling during the second quarter ended june  we recorded a tax provision in certain european jurisdictions where we generated income during both years ended december  and the power electronics group recorded a tax provision of million for the weeks of activity in the year ended december  in  we recorded a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million compared to million recorded during the same period in we record a deferred income tax asset in jurisdictions where we generate a loss 
we also record a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  when  in management s judgment  it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future 
comparison of fiscal year ended december  with fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  sales decreases for the year ended december  were attributable to volume decreases in sales to certain communications and semiconductor automatic test equipment industry customers 
the industry experienced a softening across all market segments during as compared to the moderate growth seen in the industry during net sales for our two product lines are as follows  in millions year ended december  year ended december  embedded products power systems total net sales by customer category are as follows  in millions year ended december  year ended december  oems distributors service providers total cisco systems and its contract manufacturers collectively were the only customer to exceed of net sales in either of the years ended december  or with million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  in each respective year 
net sales by end markets  as defined and classified prior to the reclassification that we implemented after our acquisition of the power electronics group of magnetek  inc in october  were as follows year ended december  communications industrial transportation ate semiconductor test equipment computer and retail medical other total our combined day and day backlog are summarized were as follows  in millions year ended december  year ended december  combined day backlog combined day backlog our combined day backlog on december  was million  a decrease of compared to backlog of million on december  the decrease in backlog primarily reflects the shorter lead times and a temporary build up of inventory at our customers during the fourth quarter of our bookings were not significantly impacted by any new vendor managed inventory vmi programs during when vmi programs are initiated by customers  bookings are canceled or never placed and replaced by a forecast 
we then supply product to the customer per an agreed upon electronic signal or an order placed to ship the goods  and the customer uses the inventory as needed 
under a vmi program  the booking and billing occur simultaneously upon use of the product  and therefore there is always a book to bill ratio of for these programs 
we may bring additional vmi programs on line in the future  which could result in higher turns business and a lower backlog 
as such  we believe that backlog may not necessarily be a reliable indicator of future results over time 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million compared with a gross profit of million for as a percentage of net sales  gross profit percentage decreased to for the year ended december  from a gross profit percentage of for the same period in the decrease in gross margin during the year ended december  was primarily due to two factors 
first  the decrease of million in sales related to the volume sold during compared to negatively impacted our margin by approximately 
second  the gross margin was negatively impacted by approximately point by a write off of excess inventory resulting from a shift in our forecasted product mix as well as from product rationalization in our telecommunications power systems division in europe 
we recorded million in cost of goods sold related to the write off of the excess inventory and other inventory adjustments during the year ended december  compared to million related to write offs of excess and obsolete inventory recorded during the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in selling expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease in selling expenses during the year ended december  was primarily due to the decrease in product revenue during  lower commission expense  reduced bonus expense  and due to personnel reductions as a result of the restructuring plan implemented during administrative expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease was primarily due to cost savings resulting from the restructuring of our north american and european operations during engineering and quality assurance expense

for the year ended december   our calculation of estimated interest payments includes m of interest payments related to a million credit agreement  payable through  and million term loan  payable through  that were reclassified from long term debt to current liabilities at december  as we did not seek to obtain a waiver for our noncompliance with a financial covenant requiring a maxiumum percentage of debt to equity and consider the debt potentially callable by the bank 
estimated interest payments for the year ended december  include million of interest related to our million promissory note that was accrued for the year ended december  but not paid until january item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates on outstanding financial debt instruments and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
debt 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from financial debt instruments that we enter 
we may also enter into derivative financial instrument transactions  such as swaps  in order to manage or reduce our exposure to interest rate changes related to our indebtedness 
however  under no circumstances do we enter into derivative or other financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in market interest rates related to our outstanding debt 
for example  in europe our variable long term debt bears interest on borrowings outstanding at various time intervals and is based on the euro interbank offered rate euribor 
our principal risk with respect to our variable long term debt is to changes in this market rate 
the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates for our credit facilities and long term debt obligations at december  by expected maturity dates 
the information is presented in us dollar equivalents  our reporting currency  and parenthetically in eurodollar or swiss francs  where applicable 
additionally  the us dollar equivalent carrying value of eurodollars or swiss francs denominated debt is sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates 
however  a change in the us dollar exchange rate against these currencies would not be expected have a significant effect on our future earnings 
expected maturity date fair thereafter total value amounts in millions  except for percentages credit facilities variable rate eur average interest rate variable rate chf average interest rate notes payable variable rate eur average interest rate long term debt fixed rate usd average interest rate fixed rate eur average interest rate variable rate eur average interest rate foreign currency 
a significant portion of our business operations are conducted in various countries in europe and asia 
as a result  we have a certain degree of market risk with respect to our cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency  including inter company transactions 
historically  we have not actively engaged in substantial exchange rate hedging activities  and at december   we had not entered into any significant foreign exchange contracts
